__label__1 a certain amount of unemployment is a direct result of the relative inflexibility of the labor market  considered structural unemployment  which describes when there is a societal level of disjuncture between people seeking jobs and the available jobs
__label__0 this mismatch can be geographic  they are hiring in california  but most unemployed live in alabama   technological  skilled workers are replaced by machines  as in the auto industry   or can result from any sudden change in the types of jobs people are seeking versus the types of companies that are hiring
__label__0 in   mile durkheim described what he called  mechanical  and  organic  solidarity that correlates to a society s economy
__label__1 mechanical solidarity exists in simpler societies where social cohesion comes from sharing similar work  education  and religion
__label__1 organic solidarity arises out of the mutual interdependence created by the specialization of work
__label__0 to solve this problem  people developed the idea of a means of exchange that could be used at any time  that is  money
__label__1 money refers to an object that a society agrees to assign a value to so it can be exchanged for payment
__label__0 in early economies  money was often objects like cowry shells  rice  barley  or even rum
__label__0 scholars do nt always agree on a single definition of capitalism
__label__1 for our purposes  we will define capitalism as an economic system in which there is private ownership  as opposed to state ownership  and where there is an impetus to produce profit  and thereby wealth
__label__0 this is the type of economy in place in the united states today
__label__0 by this he meant that if an owner did not work to produce or earn the property  then the owner was stealing it from those who did
__label__1 proudhon believed economies could work using a principle called mutualism  under which individuals and cooperative groups would exchange products with one another on the basis of mutually satisfactory contracts  proudhon
__label__0 by far the most important influential thinker on socialism is karl marx
__label__0 through his own writings and those with his collaborator  industrialist friedrich engels  marx used a scientific analytical process to show that throughout history  the resolution of class struggles caused changes in economies
__label__0 the functionalist would say to let market forces fluctuate in a cycle through these stages
__label__1 in reality  to control the risk of an economic depression  a sustained recession across several economic sectors   the us government will often adjust interest rates to encourage more lending  and consequently more spending
__label__0 in short  letting the natural cycle fluctuate is not a gamble most governments are willing to take
__label__0 factors that define stratification vary in different societies
__label__1 in most societies  stratification is an economic system  based on wealth  the net value of money and assets a person has  and income  a person s wages or investment dividends
__label__0 while people are regularly categorized based on how rich or poor they are  other important factors influence social standing
__label__1 a class system is based on both social factors and individual achievement
__label__1 a class consists of a set of people who share similar status with regard to factors like wealth  income  education  and occupation
__label__0 unlike caste systems  class systems are open
__label__0 meritocracy
__label__1 meritocracy is an ideal system based on the belief that social stratification is the result of personal effort  or merit  that determines social standing
__label__0 high levels of effort will lead to a high social position  and vice versa
__label__1 in the last century  the united states has seen a steady rise in its standard of living  the level of wealth available to a certain socioeconomic class in order to acquire the material necessities and comforts to maintain its lifestyle
__label__0 the standard of living is based on factors such as income  employment  class  poverty rates  and housing affordability
__label__0 in the united states  people who earn a college degree  get a job promotion  or marry someone with a good income may move up socially
__label__1 in contrast  downward mobility indicates a lowering of one s social class
__label__0 some people move downward because of business setbacks  unemployment  or illness
__label__0 patterns of intergenerational mobility can reflect long  term societal changes
__label__1 similarly  intragenerational mobility refers to changes in a person s social mobility over the course of his or her lifetime
__label__0 for example  the wealth and prestige experienced by one person may be quite different from that of his or her siblings
__label__1 structural mobility happens when societal changes enable a whole group of people to move up or down the social class ladder
__label__0 structural mobility is attributable to changes in society as a whole  not individual changes
__label__0 in   sociologists kingsley davis and wilbert moore published the davis  moore thesis  which argued that the greater the functional importance of a social role  the greater must be the reward
__label__1 the theory posits that social stratification represents the inherently unequal value of different work
__label__0 in fact  a recent oxfam    report that suggested the richest eighty  five people in the world are worth more than the poorest  billion combined
__label__1 the gini coefficient measures income inequality between countries using a  point scale on which  represents complete equality and  represents the highest possible inequality
__label__0 in   the global gini coefficient that measured the wealth gap between the core nations in the northern part of the world and the mostly peripheral nations in the southern part of the world was  percent  korseniewicz and moran
__label__0 when this nomenclature was developed  capitalistic democracies such as the united states and japan were considered part of the first world
__label__1 the poorest  most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of sub  saharan africa  latin america  and asia
__label__1 the second world was the in  between category  nations not as limited in development as the third world  but not as well off as the first world  having moderate economies and standard of living  such as china or cuba
__label__0 those that were in a state of subordination faced significant obstacles to mobilization
__label__1 core nations are dominant capitalist countries  highly industrialized  technological  and urbanized
__label__0 for example  wallerstein contends that the united states is an economic powerhouse that can support or deny support to important economic legislation with far  reaching implications  thus exerting control over every aspect of the global economy and exploiting both semi  peripheral and peripheral nations
__label__0 the oecd  organization for economic and cooperative development  countries make up a group of thirty  four nations whose governments work together to promote economic growth and sustainability
__label__0 according to the world bank  b   in   the average gross national income  gni  per capita  or the mean income of the people in a nation  found by dividing total gni by the total population  of a high  income nation belonging to the oecd was   per capita and the total population was over one billion   billion   on average   percent of the population in these nations was urban
__label__0 some of these countries include the united states  germany  canada  and the united kingdom  world bank b
__label__0 high  income countries face two major issues  capital flight and deindustrialization
__label__0 perhaps the most pressing issue for middle  income nations is the problem of debt accumulation
__label__1 as the name suggests  debt accumulation is the buildup of external debt  wherein countries borrow money from other nations to fund their expansion or growth goals
__label__0 as the uncertainties of the global economy make repaying these debts  or even paying the interest on them  more challenging  nations can find themselves in trouble
__label__1 subjective poverty describes poverty that is composed of many dimensions  it is subjectively present when your actual income does not meet your expectations and perceptions
__label__0 with the concept of subjective poverty  the poor themselves have a greater say in recognizing when it is present
__label__0 child slavery  which may include child prostitution  is a form of chattel slavery
__label__1 in debt bondage  or bonded labor  the poor pledge themselves as servants in exchange for the cost of basic necessities like transportation  room  and board
__label__0 in this scenario  people are paid less than they are charged for room and board
__label__0 according to zimmerman  martin attacked him  and in the ensuing scuffle martin was shot and killed  cnn library
__label__0 a public outcry followed martin s death
__label__1 there were allegations of racial profiling  the use by law enforcement of race alone to determine whether to stop and detain someone  a national discussion about  stand your ground laws   and a failed lawsuit in which zimmerman accused nbc of airing an edited version of the  call that made him appear racist
__label__0 zimmerman was not arrested until april   when he was charged with second  degree murder by special prosecutor angela corey
__label__1 sociologist louis wirth    defined a minority group as  any group of people who  because of their physical or cultural characteristics  are singled out from the others in the society in which they live for differential and unequal treatment  and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination
__label__0 the term minority connotes discrimination  and in its sociological use  the term subordinate group can be used interchangeably with the term minority  while the term dominant group is often substituted for the group that s in the majority
__label__1 these definitions correlate to the concept that the dominant group is that which holds the most power in a given society  while subordinate groups are those who lack power compared to the dominant group
__label__1 prejudice refers to the beliefs  thoughts  feelings  and attitudes someone holds about a group
__label__0 a prejudice is not based on experience  instead  it is a prejudgment  originating outside actual experience
__label__0 for example  the disproportionate number of black men arrested  charged  and convicted of crimes may reflect racial profiling  a form of institutional racism
__label__1 colorism is another kind of prejudice  in which someone believes one type of skin tone is superior or inferior to another within a racial group
__label__0 studies suggest that darker skinned african americans experience more discrimination than lighter skinned african americans  herring  keith  and horton   klonoff and landrine
__label__1 institutional discrimination can also include the promotion of a group s status  such in the case of white privilege  which is the benefits people receive simply by being part of the dominant group
__label__0 while most white people are willing to admit that nonwhite people live with a set of disadvantages due to the color of their skin  very few are willing to acknowledge the benefits they receive
__label__0 racial tensions in the united states the death of michael brown in ferguson  mo on august    illustrates racial tensions in the united states as well as the overlap between prejudice  discrimination  and institutional racism
__label__0 on that day  brown  a young unarmed black man  was killed by a white police officer named darren wilson
__label__0 for example  vivien thomas     the black surgical technician who helped develop the groundbreaking surgical technique that saves the lives of  blue babies  was classified as a janitor for many years  and paid as such  despite the fact that he was conducting complicated surgical experiments
__label__0 the years since the civil war have showed a pattern of attempted disenfranchisement  with gerrymandering and voter suppression efforts aimed at predominantly minority neighborhoods
__label__1 feminist sociologist patricia hill collins    developed intersection theory  which suggests we can not separate the effects of race  class  gender  sexual orientation  and other attributes
__label__0 when we examine race and how it can bring us both advantages and disadvantages  it is important to acknowledge that the way we experience race is shaped  for example  by our gender and class
__label__1 expulsion refers to a subordinate group being forced  by a dominant group  to leave a certain area or country
__label__0 as seen in the examples of the trail of tears and the holocaust  expulsion can be a factor in genocide
__label__1 assimilation describes the process by which a minority individual or group gives up its own identity by taking on the characteristics of the dominant culture
__label__0 in the united states  which has a history of welcoming and absorbing immigrants from different lands  assimilation has been a function of immigration
__label__0 however  sociologists and most other social scientists view them as conceptually distinct
__label__1 sex refers to physical or physiological differences between males and females  including both primary sex characteristics  the reproductive system  and secondary characteristics such as height and muscularity
__label__1 sex refers to physical or physiological differences between males and females  including both primary sex characteristics  the reproductive system  and secondary characteristics such as height and muscularity
__label__1 gender refers to behaviors  personal traits  and social positions that society attributes to being female or male
__label__0 a person s sex  as determined by his or her biology  does not always correspond with his or her gender
__label__0 heterosexuals and homosexuals may also be referred to informally as  straight  and  gay   respectively
__label__1 the united states is a heteronormative society  meaning it assumes sexual orientation is biologically determined and unambiguous
__label__0 consider that homosexuals are often asked   when did you know you were gay   but heterosexuals are rarely asked   when did you know that you were straight    ryle
__label__0 in this socialization process  children are introduced to certain roles that are typically linked to their biological sex
__label__1 the term gender role refers to society s concept of how men and women are expected to look and how they should behave
__label__0 these roles are based on norms  or standards  created by society
__label__0 however  it is estimated that two to five percent of the us population is transgender  transgender law and policy institute
__label__1 transgender individuals who attempt to alter their bodies through medical interventions such as surgery and hormonal therapy  so that their physical being is better aligned with gender identity  are called transsexuals
__label__0 they may also be known as male  to  female  mtf  or female  to  male  ftm
__label__1 furthermore  the word gay  as it refers to a homosexual   carried a somewhat negative and unfavorable meaning fifty years ago  but it has since gained more neutral and even positive connotations
__label__1 when people perform tasks or possess characteristics based on the gender role assigned to them  they are said to be doing gender
__label__0 this notion is based on the work of west and zimmerman
__label__0 sexual attitudes and practicesin the area of sexuality  sociologists focus their attention on sexual attitudes and practices  not on physiology or anatomy
__label__1 sexuality is viewed as a person s capacity for sexual feelings
__label__0 studying sexual attitudes and practices is a particularly interesting field of sociology because sexual behavior is a cultural universal
__label__0 the gerontology research group    estimates there are between  and  people worldwide who are at least  years of age
__label__1 centenarians are people living to be  years old  and they are approximately  times more common than supercentenarians
__label__0 in   there were about  centenarians in the united states alone
__label__0 this median age has been increasing  which indicates the population as a whole is growing older
__label__1 a cohort is a group of people who share a statistical or demographic trait
__label__0 people belonging to the same age cohort were born in the same time frame
__label__0 from  to approximately   the global population of individuals age sixty  five and older increased by a range of    percent  lee
__label__1 this percentage is expected to increase and will have a huge impact on the dependency ratio  the number of nonproductive citizens  young  disabled  or elderly  to productive working citizens  bartram and roe
__label__1 this percentage is expected to increase and will have a huge impact on the dependency ratio  the number of nonproductive citizens  young  disabled  or elderly  to productive working citizens  bartram and roe
__label__1 one country that will soon face a serious aging crisis is china  which is on the cusp of an  aging boom   a period when its elderly population will dramatically increase
__label__0 dr ignatz nascher and the birth of geriatrics
__label__1 in the early s  a new york physician named dr ignatz nascher coined the term geriatrics  a medical specialty that focuses on the elderly
__label__0 he created the word by combining two greek words  geron  old man  and iatrikos  medical treatment
__label__0 it broke new ground and opened the doors for sociologists  social workers  health practitioners  and therapists to study death and help those who were facing death
__label__1 kbler  ross s work is generally considered a major contribution to thanatology  the systematic study of death and dying
__label__0 the loss of independence is one potential part of the process  as are diminished physical ability and age discrimination
__label__1 the term senescence refers to the aging process  including biological  emotional  intellectual  social  and spiritual changes
__label__0 this section discusses some of the challenges we encounter during this process
__label__0 this makes the care  providing situation more complex
__label__1 elder abuse occurs when a caretaker intentionally deprives an older person of care or harms the person in his or her charge
__label__0 caregivers may be family members  relatives  friends  health professionals  or employees of senior housing or nursing care
__label__1 according to continuity theory  the elderly make specific choices to maintain consistency in internal  personality structure  beliefs  and external structures  relationships   remaining active and involved throughout their elder years
__label__0 this is an attempt to maintain social equilibrium and stability by making future decisions on the basis of already developed social roles  atchley   atchley
__label__1 finally  exchange theory  dowd    a rational choice approach  suggests we experience an increased dependence as we age and must increasingly submit to the will of others because we have fewer ways of compelling others to submit to us
__label__0 indeed  inasmuch as relationships are based on mutual exchanges  as the elderly become less able to exchange resources  they will see their social circles diminish
__label__0 in many cultures  newly married couples move in with  or near to  family members
__label__1 in a patrilocal residence system it is customary for the wife to live with  or near  her husband s blood relatives  or family or orientation
__label__0 patrilocal systems can be traced back thousands of years
__label__1 it is often characterized as violence between household or family members  specifically spouses
__label__0 to include unmarried  cohabitating  and same  sex couples  family sociologists have created the term intimate partner violence  ipv
__label__0 women are the primary victims of intimate partner violence
__label__0 these universals  and the differences in the way societies and individuals experience religion  provide rich material for sociological study
__label__0 in studying religion  sociologists distinguish between what they term the experience  beliefs  and rituals of a religion
__label__1 religious experience refers to the conviction or sensation that we are connected to  the divine
__label__0 this type of communion might be experienced when people are pray or meditate
__label__1 religious beliefs are specific ideas members of a particular faith hold to be true  such as that jesus christ was the son of god  or that reincarnation exists
__label__0 for example  christianity began as a cult  transformed into a sect  and today exists as an ecclesia
__label__0 cults  like sects  are new religious groups
__label__0 in the united states today this term often carries pejorative connotations
__label__1 for instance  the christian notion of the holy trinity  god  jesus  holy spirit  defies the definition of monotheism  which is a religion based on belief in a single deity  to some scholars
__label__1 similarly  many westerners view the multiple manifestations of hinduism s godhead as polytheistic  which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities   while hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the christian trinity
__label__1 some japanese practice shinto  which follows animism  which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings  like animals  plants  and objects of the natural world  while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings
__label__1 liberation theology began as a movement within the roman catholic church in the s and s in latin america  and it combines christian principles with political activism
__label__0 it uses the church to promote social change via the political arena  and it is most often seen in attempts to reduce or eliminate social injustice  discrimination  and poverty
__label__1 formal education describes the learning of academic facts and concepts through a formal curriculum
__label__0 arising from the tutelage of ancient greek thinkers  centuries of scholars have examined topics through formalized methods of learning
__label__0 another global concern in education is universal access
__label__1 this term refers to people s equal ability to participate in an education system
__label__0 such a situation leads to social class reproduction  extensively studied by french sociologist pierre bourdieu
__label__1 he researched how cultural capital  or cultural knowledge that serves  metaphorically  as currency that helps us navigate a culture  alters the experiences and opportunities available to french students from different social classes
__label__0 members of the upper and middle classes have more cultural capital than do families of lower  class status
__label__1 in   the bush administration passed the no child left behind act  which requires states to test students in designated grades
__label__0 the results of those tests determine eligibility to receive federal funding
__label__0 according to weber  the power of traditional authority is accepted because that has traditionally been the case  its legitimacy exists because it has been accepted for a long time
__label__0 britain s queen elizabeth  for instance  occupies a position that she inherited based on the traditional rules of succession for the monarchy
__label__1 according to weber  power made legitimate by laws  written rules  and regulations is termed rational  legal authority
__label__0 in this type of authority  power is vested in a particular rationale  system  or ideology and not necessarily in the person who implements the specifics of that doctrine
__label__0 as mentioned above  the monarchies of most modern nations are ceremonial remnants of tradition  and individuals who hold titles in such sovereignties are often aristocratic figureheads
__label__1 a few nations today  however  are run by governments wherein a monarch has absolute or unmitigated power
__label__0 such nations are called absolute monarchies
__label__0 although governments and regimes are constantly changing across the global landscape  it is generally safe to say that most modern absolute monarchies are concentrated in the middle east and africa
__label__0 power in a dictatorship is held by a single person  or a very small group  that wields complete and absolute authority over a government and population
__label__1 like some absolute monarchies  dictatorships may be corrupt and seek to limit or even eradicate the liberties of the general population
__label__1 thus  the united states is a constitution  based federal republic in which citizens elect representatives to make policy decisions on their behalf
__label__1 the term representative democracy  which is virtually synonymous with republic  can also be used to describe a government in which citizens elect representatives to promote policies that favor their interests
__label__0 in the united states  representatives are elected at local and state levels  and the votes of the electoral college determine who will hold the office of president
__label__0 marx believed that conflict between groups struggling to either attain wealth and power or keep the wealth and power they had was inevitable in a capitalist society  and conflict was the only way for the underprivileged to eventually gain some measure of equality
__label__0 c
__label__1 wright mills    elaborated on some of marx s concepts  coining the phrase power elite to describe what he saw as the small group of powerful people who control much of a society
__label__0 near mecca  saudi arabia  a prophet named muhammad received a revelation that became a cornerstone of the islamic faith
__label__1 the koran contained his message  affirming monotheism but identifying christ not as god but as a prophet like moses  abraham  david  and muhammad
__label__0 following muhammad s death in   islam spread by both conversion and military conquest across the middle east and asia minor to india and northern africa  crossing the straits of gibraltar into spain in the year    link
__label__0 in the seventh and eighth centuries  islam spread quickly across north africa and into the middle east
__label__0 just to the east of portugal  king ferdinand of aragon married queen isabella of castile in   uniting two of the most powerful independent kingdoms on the iberian peninsula and laying the foundation for the modern nation of spain
__label__1 isabella  motivated by strong religious zeal  was instrumental in beginning the inquisition in   a brutal campaign to root out jews and muslims who had seemingly converted to christianity but secretly continued to practice their faith  as well as other heretics
__label__0 this powerful couple ruled for the next twenty  five years  centralizing authority and funding exploration and trade with the east
__label__0 typically  these servants became a part of the extended tribal family
__label__1 there is some evidence of chattel slavery  in which people are treated as personal property to be bought and sold  in the nile valley
__label__0 it appears there was a slave  trade route through the sahara that brought sub  saharan africans to rome  which had slaves from all over the world
__label__0 to farm  the aztec constructed barges made of reeds and filled them with fertile soil
__label__1 lake water constantly irrigated these chinampas  or  floating gardens   which are still in use and can be seen today in xochimilco  a district of mexico city
__label__1 elizabeth did sanction an early attempt at colonization in   when sir walter raleigh  a favorite of the queen s  attempted to establish a colony at roanoke  an island off the coast of present  day north carolina
__label__1 elizabeth did sanction an early attempt at colonization in   when sir walter raleigh  a favorite of the queen s  attempted to establish a colony at roanoke  an island off the coast of present  day north carolina
__label__1 the colony was small  consisting of only  people  who suffered a poor relationship with the local indians  the croatans  and struggled to survive in their new land   link
__label__0 the pilgrims differed from other puritans in their insistence on separating from what they saw as the corrupt church of england
__label__0 for this reason  pilgrims are known as separatists  like jamestown  plymouth occupies an iconic place in american national memory
__label__0 the tale of the  migrants who crossed the atlantic aboard the mayflower and their struggle for survival is a well  known narrative of the founding of the country
__label__1 las casas s writing about the spaniards  horrific treatment of indians helped inspire the so  called black legend  the idea that the spanish were bloodthirsty conquerors with no regard for human life
__label__0 perhaps not surprisingly  those who held this view of the spanish were spain s imperial rivals
__label__0 the s and early s also introduced the process of commodification to the new world
__label__1 american silver  tobacco  and other items  which were used by native peoples for ritual purposes  became european commodities with a monetary value that could be bought and sold
__label__0 native peoples had no immunity to diseases from across the atlantic  to which they had never been exposed
__label__0 european explorers unwittingly brought with them chickenpox  measles  mumps  and smallpox  which ravaged native peoples despite their attempts to treat the diseases  decimating some populations and wholly destroying others   link
__label__0 on october     however  he made landfall on an island in the bahamas
__label__1 he then sailed to an island he named hispaniola  present  day dominican republic and haiti    link
__label__1 believing he had landed in the east indies  columbus called the native tanos he found there  indios   giving rise to the term  indian  for any native people of the new world
__label__1 martin luther   link   was a german catholic monk who took issue with the catholic church s practice of selling indulgences  documents that absolved sinners of their errant behavior
__label__0 he also objected to the catholic church s taxation of ordinary germans and the delivery of mass in latin  arguing that it failed to instruct german catholics  who did not understand the language
__label__0 to meet these labor demands  early virginians relied on indentured servants
__label__1 an indenture is a labor contract that young  impoverished  and often illiterate englishmen and occasionally englishwomen signed in england  pledging to work for a number of years  usually between five and seven  growing tobacco in the chesapeake colonies
__label__0 in return  indentured servants received paid passage to america and food  clothing  and lodging
__label__1 once sold to traders  all slaves sent to america endured the hellish middle passage  the transatlantic crossing  which took one to two months
__label__0 by   more than  africans had been shipped to the new world  though many thousands perished during the voyage
__label__0 indians refashioned european brassware into arrow points and turned axes used for chopping wood into weapons
__label__1 the most prized piece of european weaponry to obtain was a musket  or light  long  barreled european gun
__label__0 in order to trade with europeans for these  native peoples intensified their harvesting of beaver  commercializing their traditional practice
__label__0 a handful of french jesuit priests also made their way to canada  intent on converting the native inhabitants to catholicism
__label__1 the jesuits were members of the society of jesus  an elite religious order founded in the s to spread catholicism and combat the spread of protestantism
__label__1 the jesuits were members of the society of jesus  an elite religious order founded in the s to spread catholicism and combat the spread of protestantism
__label__0 the first jesuits arrived in quebec in the s  and for the next century  their numbers did not exceed forty priests
__label__1 in   james ii applied his concept of a centralized state to the colonies by creating an enormous colony called the dominion of new england
__label__0 the dominion included all the new england colonies  massachusetts  new hampshire  plymouth  connecticut  new haven  and rhode island  and in  was enlarged by the addition of new york and new jersey
__label__1 during the eighteenth century  the british atlantic experienced an outburst of protestant revivalism known as the first great awakening
__label__0 a second great awakening would take place in the s
__label__1 franklin subscribed to deism  an enlightenment  era belief in a god who created  but has no continuing involvement in  the world and the events within it
__label__1 deists also advanced the belief that personal morality  an individual s moral compass  leading to good works and actions  is more important than strict church doctrines
__label__0 charles ii was committed to expanding england s overseas possessions
__label__1 his policies in the s through the s established and supported the restoration colonies  the carolinas  new jersey  new york  and pennsylvania
__label__1 all the restoration colonies started as proprietary colonies  that is  the king gave each colony to a trusted individual  family  or group
__label__0 during his long term       walpole governed according to his belief that commerce flourished best when it was not encumbered with restrictions
__label__1 historians have described this lack of strict enforcement of the navigation acts as salutary neglect
__label__0 in addition  nothing prevented colonists from building their own fleet of ships to engage in trade
__label__0 the massachusetts government act had shut down the colonial government there  but resistance  minded colonists began meeting in extralegal assemblies
__label__1 one of these assemblies  the massachusetts provincial congress  passed the suffolk resolves in september   which laid out a plan of resistance to the intolerable acts
__label__0 meanwhile  the first continental congress was convening to discuss how to respond to the acts themselves
__label__0 if the commons had the balance of power  democracy or mob rule would prevail
__label__0 the british constitution promised representation of the will of british subjects  and without such representation  even the indirect tax of the sugar act was considered a threat to the settlers  rights as british subjects
__label__0 furthermore  some american colonists felt the colonies were on equal political footing with great britain
__label__1 in early   leaders in parliament responded with a set of four measures designed to punish massachusetts  commonly known at the coercive acts
__label__1 the boston port act shut down boston harbor until the east india company was repaid
__label__0 while these gentry were drafting their grievances during the stamp act congress  other colonists showed their distaste for the new act by boycotting british goods and protesting in the streets
__label__1 two groups  the sons of liberty and the daughters of liberty  led the popular resistance to the stamp act
__label__0 both groups considered themselves british patriots defending their liberty  just as their forebears had done in the time of james ii
__label__0 in massachusetts in   samuel adams wrote a letter that became known as the massachusetts circular
__label__1 sent by the massachusetts house of representatives to the other colonial legislatures  the letter laid out the unconstitutionality of taxation without representation and encouraged the other colonies to again protest the taxes by boycotting british goods
__label__0 gage s actions led to the formation of local rebel militias that were able to mobilize in a minute s time
__label__0 these minutemen  many of whom were veterans of the french and indian war  played an important role in the war for independence
__label__0 in one instance  general gage seized munitions in cambridge and charlestown  but when he arrived to do the same in salem  his troops were met by a large crowd of minutemen and had to leave empty  handed
__label__0 in virginia  the royal governor  lord dunmore  raised loyalist forces to combat the rebel colonists and also tried to use the large slave population to put down the rebellion
__label__1 in november   he issued a decree  known as dunmore s proclamation  promising freedom to slaves and indentured servants of rebels who remained loyal to the king and who pledged to fight with the loyalists against the insurgents
__label__0 dunmore s proclamation exposed serious problems for both the patriot cause and for the british
__label__0 in the summer of   cornwallis moved his army to yorktown  virginia
__label__0 he expected the royal navy to transport his army to new york  where he thought he would join general sir henry clinton
__label__1 monarchy rests on the practice of dynastic succession  in which the monarch s child or other relative inherits the throne
__label__0 contested dynastic succession produced chronic conflict and warfare in europe
__label__0 enlightenment political thought profoundly influenced adams and other revolutionary leaders seeking to create viable republican governments
__label__0 the ideas of the french philosopher montesquieu  who had advocated the separation of powers in government  guided adams s thinking
__label__0 responding to a request for advice on proper government from north carolina  adams wrote thoughts on government  which influenced many state legislatures
__label__0 the number of representatives in the upper chamber would also be based on the state s population
__label__0 this proportional representation gave the more populous states  like virginia  more political power
__label__1 the virginia plan also called for an executive branch and a judicial branch  both of which were absent under the articles of confederation
__label__1 under the three  fifths compromise in the  constitution  each slave would be counted as three  fifths of a person  so that three  fifths of the slave population would be counted toward the overall state population
__label__0 article   section  stipulated that  representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states
__label__1 supporters of the  constitution  known as federalists  made the case that a centralized republic provided the best solution for the future
__label__1 those who opposed it  known as anti  federalists  argued that the constitution would consolidate all power in a national government  robbing the states of the power to make their own decisions
__label__0 to them  the constitution appeared to mimic the old corrupt and centralized british regime  under which a far  off government made the laws
__label__0 the united states operated with a flurry of different notes from multiple state banks and no coherent regulation
__label__0 by proposing that the new national bank buy up large volumes of state bank notes and demanding their conversion into gold  hamilton especially wanted to discipline those state banks that issued paper money irresponsibly
__label__1 to that end  he delivered his  report on a national bank  in december   proposing a bank of the united states  an institution modeled on the bank of england
__label__0 in   the revolutionary french government sent edmond  charles gent to the united states to negotiate an alliance with the us government
__label__1 france authorized gent to issue letters of marque  documents authorizing ships and their crews to engage in piracy  to allow him to arm captured british ships in american ports with us soldiers
__label__0 gent arrived in charleston  south carolina  amid great democratic  republican fanfare
__label__1 the french foreign minister  charles  maurice de talleyrand  sent emissaries who told the american envoys that the united states must repay all outstanding debts owed to france  lend france  million guilders  dutch currency   and pay a   bribe before any negotiations could take place
__label__0 news of the attempt to extract a bribe  known as the xyz affair because the french emissaries were referred to as x  y  and z in letters that president adams released to congress  outraged the american public and turned public opinion decidedly against france   link
__label__0 in the court of public opinion  federalists appeared to have been correct in their interpretation of france  while the pro  french democratic  republicans had been misled
__label__1 during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries  artisans  skilled  experienced craft workers  produced goods by hand
__label__0 the production of shoes provides a good example
__label__1 the land law of  further encouraged land sales in the northwest territory by reducing the minimum parcel size by half and enabling sales on credit  with the goal of stimulating settlement by ordinary farmers
__label__0 the government created land offices to handle these sales and established them in the west within easy reach of prospective landowners
__label__0 they could thus purchase land directly from the government  at the price the government had set
__label__1 whitney also worked on machine tools  devices that cut and shaped metal to make standardized  interchangeable parts for other mechanical devices like clocks and guns
__label__0 whitney s machine tools to manufacture parts for muskets enabled guns to be manufactured and repaired by people other than skilled gunsmiths
__label__0 the railroads with steam locomotives offered a new mode of transportation that fascinated citizens  buoying their optimistic view of the possibilities of technological progress
__label__1 the mohawk and hudson railroad was the first to begin service with a steam locomotive
__label__0 its inaugural train ran in  on a track outside albany and covered twelve miles in twenty  five minutes
__label__0 however  as federalist ideals fell out of favor  ordinary men from the middle and lower classes increasingly questioned the idea that property ownership was an indication of virtue
__label__1 they argued for universal manhood suffrage  or voting rights for all white male adults
__label__0 so too did the appointment of clay as secretary of state
__label__0 john c calhoun labeled the whole affair a  corrupt bargain    link
__label__0 everywhere  jackson supporters vowed revenge against the anti  majoritarian result of
__label__0 amid revelations of widespread fraud  including the disclosure that some   was missing from the treasury department  jackson removed almost  percent of appointed civil officers  which allowed him to handpick their replacements
__label__1 this replacement of appointed federal officials is called rotation in office
__label__0 lucrative posts  such as postmaster and deputy postmaster  went to party loyalists  especially in places where jackson s support had been weakest  such as new england
__label__0 some southerners feared the federal government would next take additional action against the south  including the abolition of slavery
__label__1 the theory of nullification  or the voiding of unwelcome federal laws  provided wealthy slaveholders  who were a minority in the united states  with an argument for resisting the national government if it acted contrary to their interests
__label__1 james hamilton  who served as governor of south carolina in the early s  denounced the  despotic majority that oppresses us
__label__0 nullification also raised the specter of secession  aggrieved states at the mercy of an aggressive majority would be forced to leave the union
__label__1 this message referred directly to the situation in georgia  mississippi  and alabama  where the creek  choctaw  chickasaw  seminole  and cherokee peoples stood as obstacles to white settlement
__label__0 these groups were known as the five civilized tribes  because they had largely adopted anglo  american culture  speaking english and practicing christianity
__label__0 some held slaves like their white counterparts
__label__0 a great deal of the social revolution of democracy  however  carried negative consequences
__label__1 indeed  tocqueville described a new type of tyranny  the tyranny of the majority  which overpowers the will of minorities and individuals and was  in his view  unleashed by democracy in the united states
__label__1 for centuries europeans had mistakenly believed an all  water route across the north american continent existed
__label__0 this  northwest passage  would afford the country that controlled it not only access to the interior of north america but also  more importantly  a relatively quick route to the pacific ocean and to trade with asia
__label__0 the spanish  french  and british searched for years before american explorers took up the challenge of finding it
__label__1 northern representatives supported the tallmadge amendment  denouncing slavery as immoral and opposed to the nation s founding principles of equality and liberty
__label__0 southerners in congress rejected the amendment as an attempt to gradually abolish slavery  not just in missouri but throughout the union  by violating the property rights of slaveholders and their freedom to take their property wherever they wished
__label__0 texas was sparsely settled  and the few mexican farmers and ranchers who lived there were under constant threat of attack by hostile indian tribes  especially the comanche  who supplemented their hunting with raids in pursuit of horses and cattle
__label__0 to increase the non  indian population in texas and provide a buffer zone between its hostile tribes and the rest of mexico  spain began to recruit empresarios
__label__1 an empresario was someone who brought settlers to the region in exchange for generous grants of land
__label__0 moses austin  a once  prosperous entrepreneur reduced to poverty by the panic of   requested permission to settle three hundred english  speaking american residents in texas
__label__1 accustomed to representative democracy  jury trials  and the defendant s right to appear before a judge  the anglo  american settlers in texas also disliked the mexican legal system  which provided for an initial hearing by an alcalde  an administrator who often combined the duties of mayor  judge  and law enforcement officer
__label__1 accustomed to representative democracy  jury trials  and the defendant s right to appear before a judge  the anglo  american settlers in texas also disliked the mexican legal system  which provided for an initial hearing by an alcalde  an administrator who often combined the duties of mayor  judge  and law enforcement officer
__label__0 the alcalde sent a written record of the proceeding to a judge in saltillo  the state capital  who decided the outcome
__label__0 the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo  signed in february   was a triumph for american expansionism under which mexico ceded nearly half its land to the united states
__label__1 the mexican cession  as the conquest of land west of the rio grande was called  included the current states of california  new mexico  arizona  nevada  utah  and portions of colorado and wyoming
__label__0 mexico also recognized the rio grande as the border with the united states
__label__1 committed to protecting white workers by keeping slavery out of the lands taken from mexico  pennsylvania congressman david wilmot attached to an  revenue bill an amendment that would prohibit slavery in the new territory
__label__0 the wilmot proviso was not entirely new
__label__0 other congressmen had drafted similar legislation  and wilmot s language was largely copied from the  northwest ordinance that had banned slavery in that territory
__label__1 disgusted by the result  the barnburners united with antislavery whigs and former members of the liberty party to form a new political party  the free  soil party  which took as its slogan  free soil  free speech  free labor  and free men
__label__0 the party had one real goal  to oppose the extension of slavery into the territories   link
__label__0 in the minds of its members and many other northerners of the time  southern slaveholders had marshaled their wealth and power to control national politics for the purpose of protecting the institution of slavery and extending it into the territories
__label__1 in the antebellum era  that is  in the years before the civil war  american planters in the south continued to grow chesapeake tobacco and carolina rice as they had in the colonial era
__label__1 cotton  however  emerged as the antebellum south s major commercial crop  eclipsing tobacco  rice  and sugar in economic importance
__label__0 some slaveholders responded to this situation by freeing slaves  far more decided to sell their excess bondsmen
__label__1 virginia and maryland therefore took the lead in the domestic slave trade  the trading of slaves within the borders of the united states
__label__0 calhoun became a leading political theorist defending slavery and the rights of the south  which he saw as containing an increasingly embattled minority
__label__1 he advanced the idea of a concurrent majority  a majority of a separate region  that would otherwise be in the minority of the nation  with the power to veto or disallow legislation put forward by a hostile majority
__label__1 missionaries and circuit riders  ministers without a fixed congregation  brought the message of the awakening across the united states  including into the lives of slaves
__label__0 the revival spurred many slaveholders to begin encouraging their slaves to become christians
__label__0 in   a second german religious society  led by george rapp  took root in pennsylvania with several hundred members called rappites who encouraged celibacy and adhered to the socialist principle of holding all goods in common  as opposed to allowing individual ownership
__label__0 they not only built the town of harmony but also produced surplus goods to sell to the outside world
__label__1 graham advocated baths and cleanliness in general to preserve health  hydropathy  or water cures for various ailments  became popular in the united states in the s and s
__label__0 he also viewed masturbation and excessive sex as a cause of disease and debility
__label__0 william lloyd garrison of massachusetts distinguished himself as the leader of the abolitionist movement
__label__0 although he had once been in favor of colonization  he came to believe that such a scheme only deepened racism and perpetuated the sinful practices of his fellow americans
__label__0 in   about three hundred male and female feminists  many of them veterans of the abolition campaign  gathered at the seneca falls convention in new york for a conference on women s rights that was organized by lucretia mott and elizabeth cady stanton
__label__0 it was the first of what became annual meetings that have continued to the present day
__label__0 most stayed in the south  hiding in plain sight among free blacks in urban areas
__label__1 nonetheless  southerners feared the influence of a vast underground railroad  the network of northern whites and free blacks who sympathized with runaway slaves and provided safe houses and safe passage from the south
__label__0 quakers  who had long been troubled by slavery  were especially active in this network
__label__0 in   several months after president buchanan took the oath of office  the supreme court ruled in dred scott v sandford
__label__0 dred scott   link    born a slave in virginia in   had been one of the thousands forced to relocate as a result of the massive internal slave trade and taken to missouri  where slavery had been adopted as part of the missouri compromise
__label__0 southern leaders were divided on how to respond to republican success
__label__1 southern extremists  known as  fire  eaters   openly called for secession
__label__0 others  like mississippi senator jefferson davis  put forward a more moderate approach by demanding constitutional protection of slavery
__label__0 in this way  states could protect themselves  and slavery  from interference by what they perceived to be an overbearing central government
__label__0 the constitution of the confederate states of america  csa   or the confederacy  drafted at a convention in montgomery  alabama  in february   closely followed the  constitution
__label__0 the only real difference between the two documents centered on slavery
__label__0 general george b mcclellan  the general in chief of the army  responsible for overall control of union land forces  proved especially reluctant to engage in battle with the confederates
__label__0 in direct command of the army of the potomac  the union fighting force operating outside washington  dc  mcclellan believed  incorrectly  that confederate forces were too strong to defeat and was reluctant to risk his troops in battle
__label__0 general ulysses s grant s army of the west  operating in kentucky  tennessee  and the mississippi river valley  had been more successful
__label__0 in the western campaign  the goal of both the union and the confederacy was to gain control of the major rivers in the west  especially the mississippi
__label__0 the republican emphasis on free labor  rather than slave labor  also influenced the  land grant college act  commonly known as the morrill act after its author  vermont republican senator justin smith morrill
__label__1 the measure provided for the creation of agricultural colleges  funded through federal grants  to teach the latest agricultural techniques
__label__0 on january     lincoln made good on his promise and signed the emancipation proclamation
__label__1 it stated  that on the first day of january  in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty  three  all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state  the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states  shall be then  thenceforward  and forever free
__label__0 the proclamation did not immediately free the slaves in the confederate states
__label__0 many whites in the north found this deeply offensive  since they still believed in racial inequality
__label__0 the  new york city draft riots illustrated the depth of white anger
__label__0 from the outset of the rebellion in   lincoln s overriding goal had been to bring the southern states quickly back into the fold in order to restore the union   link
__label__0 in early december   the president began the process of reunification by unveiling a three  part proposal known as the ten percent plan that outlined how the states would return
__label__1 the ten percent plan gave a general pardon to all southerners except high  ranking confederate government and military leaders  required  percent of the  voting population in the former rebel states to take a binding oath of future allegiance to the united states and the emancipation of slaves  and declared that once those voters took those oaths  the restored confederate states would draft new state constitutions
__label__0 it was important for them to show that the party supported all loyal men  regardless of their origin or political persuasion
__label__0 johnson appeared an ideal choice  because his nomination would bring with it the support of both pro  southern elements and the war democrats who rejected the conciliatory stance of the copperheads  the northern democrats who opposed the civil war
__label__1 in  and   as johnson announced the end of reconstruction  southern states began to pass a series of discriminatory state laws collectively known as black codes
__label__0 while the laws varied in both content and severity from state to state  the goal of the laws remained largely consistent
__label__0 more dispiriting still was the fact that many women s rights activists  such as susan b anthony and elizabeth cady stanton  had played a large part in the abolitionist movement leading up to the civil war
__label__1 following the war  women and men  white and black  formed the american equal rights association  aera  for the expressed purpose of securing  equal rights to all american citizens  especially the right of suffrage  irrespective of race  color or sex
__label__0 two years later  with the adoption of the fourteenth amendment  section  of which specifically qualified the liberties it extended to  male citizens   it seemed as though the progress made in support of civil rights was not only passing women by but was purposely codifying their exclusion
__label__0 as congress debated the language of the fifteenth amendment  some held out hope that it would finally extend the franchise to women
__label__1 throughout the south  sharecropping took root  a crop  lien system that worked to the advantage of landowners
__label__0 under the system  freed people rented the land they worked  often on the same plantations where they had been slaves
__label__0 in what became known as the compromise of   republican senate leaders worked with the democratic leadership so they would support hayes and the commission s decision
__label__1 the two sides agreed that one southern democrat would be appointed to hayes s cabinet  democrats would control federal patronage  the awarding of government jobs  in their areas in the south  and there would be a commitment to generous internal improvements  including federal aid for the texas and pacific railway
__label__1 in addition to a significant european migration westward  several thousand african americans migrated west following the civil war  as much to escape the racism and violence of the old south as to find new economic opportunities
__label__0 they were known as exodusters  referencing the biblical flight from egypt  because they fled the racism of the south  with most of them headed to kansas from kentucky  tennessee  louisiana  mississippi  and texas
__label__0 over twenty  five thousand exodusters arrived in kansas in    alone
__label__0 the search for gold represented an opportunity far different from the slow plod that homesteading farmers faced
__label__1 the discovery of gold at sutter s mill in coloma  california  set a pattern for such strikes that was repeated again and again for the next decade  in what collectively became known as the california gold rush
__label__0 in what became typical  a sudden disorderly rush of prospectors descended upon a new discovery site  followed by the arrival of those who hoped to benefit from the strike by preying off the newly rich
__label__1 one of the more vicious examples was near sand creek  colorado  where colonel john chivington led a militia raid upon a camp in which the leader had already negotiated a peaceful settlement
__label__0 the camp was flying both the american flag and the white flag of surrender when chivington s troops murdered close to one hundred people  the majority of them women and children  in what became known as the sand creek massacre
__label__0 for the rest of his life  chivington would proudly display his collection of nearly one hundred indian scalps from that day
__label__0 in a few instances  frustrated hispanic citizens fought back against the white settlers who dispossessed them of their belongings
__label__0 in    in new mexico  several hundred mexican americans formed las gorras blancas  the white caps  to try and reclaim their land and intimidate white americans  preventing further land seizures
__label__0 white caps conducted raids of white farms  burning homes  barns  and crops to express their growing anger and frustration
__label__0 the exploitation of these new technologies provided opportunities for tremendous growth  and business entrepreneurs with financial backing and the right mix of business acumen and ambition could make their fortunes
__label__1 some of these new millionaires were known in their day as robber barons  a negative term that connoted the belief that they exploited workers and bent laws to succeed
__label__0 regardless of how they were perceived  these businessmen and the companies they created revolutionized american industry
__label__0 he hounded those who refused to sell out to him  until they were driven out of business
__label__1 through his method of growth via mergers and acquisitions of similar companies  known as horizontal integration  standard oil grew to include almost all refineries in the area
__label__0 by   the standard oil company controlled nearly  percent of all oil refining businesses in the country  as well as  percent of all the refining businesses in the world
__label__0 in one night  however  the kol s popularity  and indeed the momentum of the labor movement as a whole  plummeted due to an event known as the haymarket affair  which occurred on may     in chicago s haymarket square   link
__label__1 there  an anarchist group had gathered in response to a death at an earlier nationwide demonstration for the eight  hour workday
__label__0 in the secular sphere  the settlement house movement of the s provided additional relief
__label__0 pioneering women such as jane addams in chicago and lillian wald in new york led this early progressive reform movement in the united states  building upon ideas originally fashioned by social reformers in england
__label__0 those middle  class and wealthier urbanites who enjoyed the costlier amenities presented by city life  including theaters  restaurants  and shopping  were free to escape to the suburbs  leaving behind the poorer working classes living in squalor and unsanitary conditions
__label__0 through the city beautiful movement  leaders such as frederick law olmsted and daniel burnham sought to champion middle and upper  class progressive reforms
__label__0 they improved the quality of life for city dwellers  but also cultivated middle  class  dominated urban spaces in which americans of different ethnicities  racial origins  and classes worked and lived
__label__0 other thinkers of the day took charles darwin s theories in a more nuanced direction  focusing on different theories of realism that sought to understand the truth underlying the changes in the united states
__label__0 real gdp  firms will produce and sell
__label__1 the aggregate supply  as  curve shows the total quantity of output  ie  real gdp  that firms will produce and sell at each price level
__label__0 link  shows an aggregate supply curve
__label__1 aggregate demand  ad  refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy
__label__0 strictly speaking  ad is what economists call total planned expenditure
__label__0 us exports will be relatively more expensive  and the quantity of exports sold will fall
__label__0 us imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper  so the quantity of imports will rise
__label__0 thus  a higher domestic price level  relative to price levels in other countries  will reduce net export expenditures
__label__0 in the long run  the most important factor shifting the as curve is productivity growth
__label__1 productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor
__label__1 when consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy  they tend to consume more
__label__0 if business confidence is high  then firms tend to spend more on investment  believing that the future payoff from that investment will be substantial
__label__0 conversely  if consumer or business confidence drops  then consumption and investment spending decline
__label__0 during a recession  when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses  the us congress often passes tax cuts
__label__0 during the recession of   for example  a tax cut was enacted into law
__label__0 in many of the national economies across europe  the rate of unemployment in recent decades has only dropped to about   or a bit lower  even in good economic years
__label__1 this baseline level of unemployment that occurs year  in and year  out is called the natural rate of unemployment and is determined by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the economy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market
__label__1 potential gdp can imply different unemployment rates in different economies  depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that economy
__label__0 now  focus your attention on the neoclassical zone of the sras curve  which is the near  vertical portion on the right  hand side
__label__0 if the ad curve crosses this portion of the sras curve at an equilibrium point like en where output is at or near potential gdp  then the size of potential gdp pretty much determines the level of output in the economy
__label__0 because ad is volatile  it can easily fall
__label__0 thus  even if we start at yp  if ad falls  then we find ourselves in what keynes termed a recessionary gap
__label__0 the economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment  as shown at y in the  link
__label__1 nondurable goods are things like groceries  once you consume them  they are gone
__label__0 recall from the macroeconomic perspective that services are intangible things consumers buy  like healthcare or entertainment  keynes identified three factors that affect consumption
__label__0 just as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes  so businesses need financing when they purchase big ticket items
__label__0 the cost of investment thus includes the interest rate
__label__1 even if the firm has the funds  the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital
__label__0 first  aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment
__label__1 second  the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand because of sticky wages and prices  which are wages and prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand
__label__1 we will consider these two claims in turn  and then see how they are represented in the ad  as model  the first building block of the keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of household and business sector demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed
__label__0 in fact  if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all  the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential gdp  as shown in  link
__label__1 this outcome is an important example of a macroeconomic externality  where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what happens at the micro level
__label__0 for example  a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase sales
__label__0 in the s  aw
__label__0 phillips  an economist at the london school of economics  was studying the keynesian analytical framework
__label__0 the second is changes in people s expectations about inflation
__label__0 in other words  there may be a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when people expect no inflation  but when they realize inflation is occurring  the tradeoff disappears
__label__0 both factors  supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations  cause the aggregate supply curve  and thus the phillips curve  to shift
__label__0 in this situation  unemployment is low  but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern
__label__0 the keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy  using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift ad to the left
__label__0 the result would be downward pressure on the price level  but very little reduction in output or very little rise in unemployment
__label__0 the key policy implication is this  should the government focus more on long  term growth and on controlling inflation than on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment
__label__0 this focus on long  run growth rather than the short  run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long  run macroeconomic analysis and keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run
__label__0 let s consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn  and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand  aggregate supply model  the importance of potential gdp in the long run
__label__0 growth in gdp can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology
__label__1 physical capital per person refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done
__label__0 compare  for example  your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word processing software
__label__0 keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential gdp takes a very long time  then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical
__label__0 in response to those immortal words of john maynard keynes   in the long run we are all dead   neoclassical economists respond that even if the adjustment takes as long as  say  ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in understanding the economy
__label__1 since the neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time  the only advantage of a keynesian stabilization policy would be to speed up the process and minimize the time that the unemployed are out of work
__label__1 is that the likely outcomekeynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the ability of the government to recognize a situation of too little or too much aggregate demand  and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or spending  all enacted in a timely fashion
__label__0 after all  neoclassical economists argue  it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of gdp so that politicians know whether a recession is occurring  and those preliminary estimates may be revised substantially later
__label__0 the macroeconomic equilibrium along the vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels  and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation
__label__0 the great economist milton friedman      summed up the neoclassical view of the long  term phillips curve tradeoff in a  speech    there is always a temporary trade  off between inflation and unemployment  there is no permanent trade  off
__label__0 if aggregate demand rises rapidly in the neoclassical model  in the long run it leads only to inflationary pressures
__label__0 link  shows a vertical lras curve and three different levels of aggregate demand  rising from ad to ad to ad
__label__0 instead  many mainstream economists believe both the keynesian and neoclassical perspectives
__label__0 robert solow  the nobel laureate in economics in   described the dual approach in this way
__label__0 economies without money typically engage in the barter system
__label__1 barter  literally trading one good or service for another  is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy
__label__1 in an economy without money  an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants  a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide
__label__0 second  money must serve as a store of value
__label__0 in a barter system  we saw the example of the shoemaker trading shoes for accounting services
__label__1 loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future
__label__1 so money serves all of these functions  it is a medium of exchange  store of value  unit of account  and standard of deferred payment
__label__0 as economies grew and became more global in nature  the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome
__label__0 countries moved towards the use of fiat money
__label__1 fiat money has no intrinsic value  but is declared by a government to be the legal tender of a country
__label__0 there are two definitions of money  m and m money supply
__label__1 m money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash  checkable  demand  deposits  and traveler s checks m money supply is less liquid in nature and includes m plus savings and time deposits  certificates of deposits  and money market funds
__label__0 m money supply includes coins and currency in circulation  the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the us treasury  at the federal reserve bank  or in bank vaults
__label__0 closely related to currency are checkable deposits  also known as demand deposits
__label__1 for example  m includes savings deposits in banks  which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly  but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank
__label__1 many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds  where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way  such as short  term government bonds
__label__1 another ingredient of m are the relatively small  that is  less than about    certificates of deposit  cds  or time deposits  which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time  ranging from a few months to a few years  in exchange for a higher interest rate
__label__0 it is important to note that in our definition of money  it ischeckable deposits that are money  not the paper check or the debit card
__label__0 although you can make a purchase with a credit card  it is not considered money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you
__label__0 when you make a purchase with a credit card  the credit card company immediately transfers money from its checking account to the seller  and at the end of the month  the credit card company sends you a bill for what you have charged that month
__label__1 banks are a critical intermediary in what is called the payment system  which helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets
__label__0 also  those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date
__label__1 banks are a financial intermediary  that is  an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank
__label__1 financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds  but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions  which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans
__label__0 all the funds deposited are mingled in one big pool  which is then loaned out
__label__1 a bank s balance sheeta balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities
__label__1 an asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something
__label__0 for example  the cash you own can be used to pay your tuition
__label__0 a bank s balance sheet operates in much the same way
__label__1 a bank s net worth is also referred to as bank capital
__label__1 a bank has assets such as cash held in its vaults  monies that the bank holds at the federal reserve bank  called  reserves    loans that are made to customers  and bonds
__label__1 the second category of bank asset is bonds  which are a common mechanism for borrowing  used by the federal and local government  and also private companies  and nonprofit organizations
__label__0 a bank takes some of the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds  typically bonds issued by the us government
__label__1 the bank will be more willing to make what are called  subprime loans   which are loans that have characteristics like low or zero down  payment  little scrutiny of whether the borrower has a reliable income  and sometimes low payments for the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments after that
__label__0 some subprime loans made in the mids were later dubbed ninja loans  loans made even though the borrower had demonstrated no income  no job  or assets
__label__0 these subprime loans were typically sold and turned into financial securities  but with a twist
__label__0 the idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage  backed securities  certain investors would agree to take the first  say    of such losses
__label__0 fortunately  a formula exists for calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking system
__label__0 the money multiplier formula is
__label__0 some prominent central banks around the world include the european central bank  the bank of japan  and the bank of england
__label__1 in the united states  the central bank is called the federal reserve  often abbreviated as just  the fed   this section explains the organization of the us federal reserve and identifies the major responsibilities of a central bank
__label__1 bank regulation is intended to maintain the solvency of banks by avoiding excessive risk
__label__0 regulation falls into a number of categories  including reserve requirements  capital requirements  and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make
__label__1 they are allowed to purchase us treasury securities but  to protect depositors  they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky  bank capital is the difference between a bank s assets and its liabilities
__label__0 in other words  it is a bank s net worth
__label__0 a bank must have positive net worth  otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt  meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its liabilities
__label__0 in this situation  whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money  and those who did not rush to the bank quickly enough  lost their money
__label__1 depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits  as shown in  link  is called a bank run
__label__0 in the movie it s a wonderful life  the bank manager  played by jimmy stewart  faces a mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money  but manages to allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits  using the money from his own pocket that was supposed to pay for his honeymoon
__label__1 to prevent this  the fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial institutions when they can not obtain funds from anywhere else
__label__0 this is known as the lender of last resort role
__label__0 for banks  the central bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank customers that they will not lose their money
__label__1 the federal open market committee  fomc  makes the decisions regarding these open market operations
__label__0 the fomc is made up of the seven members of the federal reserve s board of governors
__label__1 a second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement  which  as we noted earlier  is the percentage of each bank s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank
__label__0 if banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves  they have less money available to lend out
__label__0 if banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount in reserves  they will have a greater amount of money available to lend out
__label__1 a monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy
__label__1 conversely  a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy
__label__0 this module will discuss how expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand  and how such policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation
__label__0 if the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment  with output below potential gdp  expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential gdp
__label__0 link   a  illustrates this situation
__label__0 link  shows how the federal reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds interest rate in the last few decades
__label__0 the graph shows the federal funds interest rate  remember  this interest rate is set through open market operations   the unemployment rate  and the inflation rate since
__label__0 different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure
__label__0 quantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways
__label__1 first  it involved the fed purchasing long term treasury bonds  rather than short term treasury bills
__label__0 in   however  it was impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as low as they could get
__label__0 if the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level  the central bank can not force individual banks to make loans
__label__0 similarly  sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession  because they recognize that firms  sales and employees  jobs are more insecure in a recession  and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments
__label__0 the result is that during an especially deep recession  an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real gdp
__label__0 specific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply being used
__label__0 consider the velocity of m  the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances
__label__0 in   for example  m was   trillion and nominal gdp was   trillion  so the velocity of m was     trillion    trillion
__label__0 this equation is sometimes called the basic quantity equation of money but  as you can see  it is just the definition of velocity written in a different form
__label__0 this equation must hold true  by definition
__label__0 in the s  when velocity as measured by m seemed predictable  a number of economists  led by nobel laureate milton friedman       argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant growth rate
__label__0 these economists argued that with the long and variable lags of monetary policy  and the political pressures on central bankers  central bank monetary policies were as likely to have undesirable as to have desirable effects
__label__1 this vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have rewritten their central banking laws since in the s to have their bank practice inflation targeting  which means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low
__label__0 by   central banks in  countries  including austria  brazil  canada  israel  korea  mexico  new zealand  spain  sweden  thailand  and the united kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate
__label__0 one long  standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future
__label__1 for example  from  to  during what was known as the  dot  com  boom  the us stock market  which is measured by the dow jones industrial index  which includes  very large companies from across the us economy   nearly tripled in value
__label__0 the nasdaq index  which includes many smaller technology companies  increased in value by a multiple of five from  to
__label__1 at a broader level  some economists worry about a leverage cycle  where  leverage  is a term used by financial economists to mean  borrowing   when economic times are good  banks and the financial sector are eager to lend  and people and firms are eager to borrow
__label__1 remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier  a process of loans being made  money being deposited  and more loans being made
__label__0 in good economic times  this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth
__label__0 sometimes small economies use the currency of an economically larger neighbor
__label__1 for example  ecuador  el salvador  and panama have decided to dollarize  that is  to use the us dollar as their currency
__label__0 sometimes nations share a common currency
__label__0 in foreign exchange markets  demand and supply become closely interrelated  because a person or firm who demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency  and vice versa
__label__0 to get a sense of this  it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market     firms that are involved in international trade of goods and services     tourists visiting other countries     international investors buying ownership  or part  ownership  of a foreign firm     international investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership
__label__0 let s consider these categories in turn
__label__0 let s say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth  and not take a risk that the euro will be worth less in us dollars than it currently is
__label__1 you can hedge  which means using a financial transaction to protect yourself against a risk from one of your investments  in this case  currency risk from the contract
__label__0 specifically  you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now  regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time
__label__0 when the prices of most goods and services change  the price is said to  rise  or  fall   for exchange rates  the terminology is different
__label__1 when the exchange rate for a currency rises  so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies  it is referred to as appreciating or  strengthening   when the exchange rate for a currency falls  so that a currency trades for less of other currencies  it is referred to as depreciating or  weakening
__label__0 to illustrate the use of these terms  consider the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar since   shown in  link   a
__label__0 the vertical axis in  link   a  shows the price of   in us currency  measured in terms of canadian currency
__label__0 in the actual foreign exchange market  almost all of the trading for mexican pesos is done for us dollars
__label__0 what factors would cause the demand or supply to shift  thus leading to a change in the equilibrium exchange rate
__label__0 the answer to this question is discussed in the following section
__label__1 the exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries is called the purchasing power parity  ppp  exchange rate
__label__1 the exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries is called the purchasing power parity  ppp  exchange rate
__label__0 a group of economists at the international comparison program  run by the world bank  have calculated the ppp exchange rate for all countries  based on detailed studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods
__label__0 foreign trade in goods and services typically involves incurring the costs of production in one currency while receiving revenues from sales in another currency
__label__0 as a result  movements in exchange rates can have a powerful effect on incentives to export and import  and thus on aggregate demand in the economy as a whole
__label__0 banks play a vital role in any economy in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers
__label__0 when most of a country s largest banks become bankrupt simultaneously  a sharp decline in aggregate demand and a deep recession results
__label__0 since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable  a central bank must be concerned about whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country s existing banks into bankruptcy
__label__0 in   there was a drastic depreciation of the yen  relative to the us dollar  by about   and again at the end of the year in  also by about
__label__0 source  federal reserve economic data  fred  httpsresearchstlouisfedorgfredseriesdexjpus  the line s variations represent the volatility of exchange rates
__label__1 a soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market  but in some cases  especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction  the central bank will intervene in the market
__label__1 with a hard peg exchange rate policy  the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate
__label__0 a central bank can implement soft peg and hard peg policies
__label__0 brazil s central bank can use a contractionary monetary policy to raise interest rates  which will increase demand and reduce supply of the currency on foreign exchange markets  and lead to an appreciation
__label__0 alternatively  brazil s central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market
__label__0 another issue arises when a central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market
__label__0 if a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets  it will be buying the currency of other countries  like us dollars or euros  to hold as reserves
__label__0 holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost  and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit
__label__1 taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as tobin taxes  named after james tobin  the  nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a  lecture
__label__0 for example  a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions  or attempt to tax short  term portfolio investment while exempting long  term foreign direct investment
__label__1 a final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more nations is also called a merged currency
__label__0 a merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk altogether
__label__0 in this chapter  we revisit fiscal policy  which was first covered in welcome to economics
__label__0 fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy  the other is monetary policy
__label__1 while monetary policy is made by policymakers at the federal reserve  fiscal policy is made by congress and the president  the discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand
__label__0 all government spending and taxes affect the economy  but fiscal policy focuses strictly on the policies of the federal government
__label__1 conversely  when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year  it runs a budget surplus
__label__1 if government spending and taxes are equal  it is said to have a balanced budget
__label__0 for example  in   the us government experienced its largest budget deficit ever  as the federal government spent   trillion more than it collected in taxes
__label__0 together  the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for about   of federal tax revenues in
__label__1 although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax  nearly three  quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes  the income tax is a progressive tax  which means that the tax rates increase as a household s income increases
__label__0 taxes also vary with marital status  family size  and other factors
__label__1 the medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax  that is  a flat percentage of all wages earned
__label__1 the social security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit  but above that level it becomes a regressive tax  meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax
__label__1 the social security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit  but above that level it becomes a regressive tax  meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax
__label__0 as a share of gdp  the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time  from about   of gdp in the s to roughly   by   according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office
__label__0 the government also imposes an estate and gift tax on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation  either after death or during life in the form of gifts
__label__0 these estate and gift taxes collected about   of gdp in the first decade of the s
__label__1 graphically  we see that fiscal policy  whether through change in spending or taxes  shifts the aggregate demand outward in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and inward in the case of contractionary fiscal policy
__label__0 link  illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand  aggregate supply diagram in a growing economy
__label__0 the stimulus package of  is an example
__label__1 changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically  due to automatic stabilizers  such as unemployment insurance and food stamps  which are programs that are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially inflationary boom
__label__0 because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in financial capital markets  it not only affects aggregate demand  it can also affect interest rates
__label__1 in  link   the original equilibrium  e  in the financial capital market occurs at a quantity of   billion and an interest rate of
__label__0 many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes propose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time
__label__1 the time to get a bill passed is often referred to as the legislative lag
__label__0 finally  once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs
__label__0 also  the government is not a household for many reasons  one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities
__label__1 the argument of keynesian macroeconomic policy is that the government needs to lean against the wind  spending when times are hard and saving when times are good  for the sake of the overall economy
__label__0 the national saving and investment identity must always hold true because  by definition  the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal
__label__0 however  the formula will look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade is in surplus rather than deficit
__label__0 for example  in  and   the us government had budget surpluses  although the economy was still experiencing trade deficits
__label__0 how will this affect interest rates in financial markets
__label__0 in  link   the original equilibrium  e  where the demand curve  d  for financial capital intersects with the supply curve  s  occurs at an interest rate of   and an equilibrium quantity equal to   of gdp
__label__0 however  as the government budget deficit increases  the demand curve for financial capital shifts from d to d
__label__0 if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential gdp  threatening an inflationary increase in price levels  the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy
__label__0 in this situation  the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy  and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment
__label__0 on the other hand  if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential gdp  an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy
__label__0 in this situation  higher interest rates from government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy  and there would be little crowding out of private investment
__label__0 however  even a central bank can not erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity
__label__1 the theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing is known as ricardian equivalence because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early nineteenth  century economist david ricardo
__label__0 if ricardian equivalence holds completely true  then in the national saving and investment identity  any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving
__label__0 first  banks in turkey borrow in a widely used currency like us dollars or euros  then convert those us dollars to lira  and then lend the money to borrowers in turkey
__label__0 if the value of the lira exchange rate depreciates  then turkey s banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in us dollars or euros
__label__0 the combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand  which causes a deep recession
__label__0 many countries around the world have experienced this kind of recession in recent years  along with turkey in   this general pattern was followed by mexico in   thailand and countries across east asia in     russia in   and argentina in
__label__0 for example  life expectancy at birth in many low  income regions approximates those who are more affluent
__label__0 the data also illustrate that nobody can claim to have perfect standards of living
__label__0 for instance  despite very high income levels  there is still undernourishment in europe and north america
__label__1 the world s great economic success stories in the last few decades began in the s with that group of nations sometimes known as the east asian tigers  south korea  thailand  malaysia  indonesia  and singapore
__label__0 the list sometimes includes hong kong and taiwan  although these are often treated under international law as part of china  rather than as separate countries
__label__0 for unemployment caused by a recession  the keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available
__label__0 the monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward  run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans  drive down interest rates  and increase aggregate demand
__label__0 in a recession  there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off  and so even a central bank  with fighting inflation as its top priority  can usually justify some reduction in interest rates  with regard to fiscal policy  the automatic stabilizers discussed in government budgets and fiscal policy should be allowed to work  even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession
__label__0 there is less agreement over whether  in addition to automatic stabilizers  governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases
__label__0 in the case of the great recession  the case for this kind of extra  aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger  but for a smaller recession  given the time lags of implementing fiscal policy  discretionary fiscal policy should be used with caution
__label__0 however  the aftermath of the recession emphasizes that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not turn off a recession like flipping a switch turns off a lamp
__label__0 likewise  interest rates that are not indexed mean that the lenders of money will be paid back in devalued currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that were lent
__label__1 it is clearly possible  and perhaps sometimes necessary  for a converging economy  the economy of a country that demonstrates the ability to catch up to the technology leaders  to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would be politically unacceptable in the high  income economies
__label__0 recall from the macroeconomic perspective that a trade deficit exists when a nation s imports exceed its exports
__label__0 in order for a trade deficit to take place  foreign countries must provide loans or investments  which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually  that the deficit will become a surplus
__label__0 it would mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy  shifting the short  term aggregate supply curve to the left
__label__0 the result could be a burst of inflation and  if the federal reserve were to run a tight monetary policy to reduce the inflation  it could also lead to recession
__label__0 people sometimes talk as if the us economy  with its great size  is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international markets
__label__0 world war i severed many economic connections
__label__0 during the great depression of the s  many nations misguidedly tried to fix their own economies by reducing foreign trade with others
__label__0 world war ii further hindered international trade
__label__0 recall from the chapter choice in a world of scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods
__label__0 the question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this   what do we give up to produce this good
__label__0 it should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from choice in a world of scarcity
__label__0 the united states produces  consumes  barrels of oil and  bushels of corn
__label__0 given their current production levels  if the united states can trade an amount of corn fewer than  bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than  barrels  it will gain from trade
__label__0 with trade  the united states can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade
__label__0 then  in the numerical example given  mexico shifted production toward its comparative advantage and produced  pairs of shoes but only  refrigerators
__label__0 thus  if mexico can export no more than  pairs of shoes  giving up  pairs of shoes  in exchange for imports of at least  refrigerators  a gain of  refrigerators   it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade
__label__0 mexico will be unambiguously better off
__label__0 what can be the economic benefit of having workers of fairly similar skills making cars  computers  machinery and other products which are then shipped across the oceans to and from the united states  the european union  and japan
__label__0 there are two reasons     the division of labor leads to learning  innovation  and unique skills  and    economies of scale
__label__0 a second broad reason that intra  industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies of scale
__label__1 the concept of economies of scale  as introduced in cost and industry structure  means that as the scale of output goes up  average costs of production decline  at least up to a point
__label__0 link  illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens
__label__1 tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons
__label__0 some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries  for humanitarian reasons  and protecting against dumping
__label__0 traditionally  tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic  social  and cultural interests
__label__0 recall from international trade that tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services
__label__0 they make imports more expensive for consumers  discouraging imports
__label__0 we ll cover the gatt in more detail later in the chapter
__label__0 this agreement has since been superseded by the world trade organization  wto   whose membership includes about  nations and most of the economies of the world
__label__1 it is the primary international mechanism through which nations negotiate their trade rules  including rules about tariffs  quotas  and nontariff barriers
__label__0 there are a number of reasons  but one of them will surprise you  the trade policies of the high  income countries
__label__0 the new york times brought back the informational model  which exhibits impartiality and accuracy and promotes transparency in government and politics
__label__0 with the arrival of the progressive era  the media began muckraking  the writing and publishing of news coverage that exposed corrupt business and government practices
__label__0 investigative work like upton sinclair s serialized novel the jungle led to changes in the way industrial workers were treated and local political machines were run
__label__0 one listener described the chats as soothing  with the president acting like a father  sitting in the room with the family  cutting through the political nonsense and describing what help he needed from each family member

__label__1 social media  like facebook  also placed journalism in the hands of citizens  citizen journalism occurs when citizens use their personal recording devices and cell phones to capture events and post them on the internet
__label__0 in   citizen journalists caught both presidential candidates by surprise
__label__0 
__label__0 in june   stephen colbert of the colbert report took his soft news show on the road  heading to iraq for a week
__label__0 during the first episode  colbert interviewed ray odierno  commanding general of the coalition forces stationed in iraq
__label__0 credit  the us army
__label__0 the radio act of  was the first attempt by congress to regulate broadcast materials
__label__0 the act was written to organize the rapidly expanding number of radio stations and the overuse of frequencies
__label__0 hence  there potentially may be a loophole in which broadcasters can give free time to just one candidate s supporters
__label__0 in the  wisconsin gubernatorial recall election  scott walker s supporters were allegedly given free air time to raise funds and ask for volunteers while opponent tom barrett s supporters were not
__label__0 sue wilson   fcc  no more equal time requirements for political campaign supporters over our public airwaves   huffington post   may
__label__0 according to someone involved in the case  the fcc declined to intervene after a complaint was filed on the matter  saying the equal  time rule applied only to the actual candidates  and that the case was an instance of the now  dead fairness doctrine
__label__0 william lake  letter from the fcc regarding capstar texas llx   may   httpbradblogcomdocsfcczappledoctrinerulingpdf
__label__0 the fairness doctrine was instituted in  and required licensed stations to cover controversial issues in a balanced manner by providing listeners with information about all perspectives on any controversial issue
__label__0 if one candidate  cause  or supporter was given an opportunity to reach the viewers or listeners  the other side was to be given a chance to present its side as well
__label__0 in   former secretary of state hillary clinton was questioned about her department s decisions regarding the us consulate in benghazi  libya
__label__0 the consulate had been bombed by militants  leading to the death of an ambassador and a senior service officer
__label__0 fueled by the first amendment s protection of the press  journalists have long offered to keep sources confidential to protect them from government prosecution
__label__0 to illustrate  as part of the investigation into the outing of valerie plame as a cia officer  new york times reporter judith miller was jailed for refusing to reveal  scooter  libby  vice president dick cheney s chief of staff  as her confidential government source

__label__0 reporter s privilege has increased the number of instances in which whistleblowers and government employees have given journalists tips or documents to prompt investigation into questionable government practices
__label__0 
__label__0 this raises the question of how the media  even general newscasts  can affect citizens
__label__0 one of the ways is through framing  the creation of a narrative  or context  for a news story
__label__0 the news often uses frames to place a story in a context so the reader understands its importance or relevance
__label__0 this study supports the argument that shrinking sound bites are a way for journalists to control the story and add their own analysis rather than just report on it

__label__0 some articles focused on her qualifications to be a potential future president or her record on the issues
__label__0 us elections are based on plurality voting
__label__1 plurality voting  commonly referred to as first  past  the  post  is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins  whether or not he or she gains a majority   percent or greater  of the total votes cast
__label__0 for instance  abraham lincoln won the presidency in  even though he clearly lacked majority support given the number of candidates in the race
__label__0 after the election is over  supporters experience remorse when their least  favorite candidate wins instead
__label__0 for example  in the  election  ralph nader ran for president as the candidate of the green party
__label__0 nader  a longtime consumer activist concerned with environmental issues and social justice  attracted many votes from people who usually voted for democratic candidates
__label__0 electoral rules are probably not the only reason the united states has a two  party system
__label__0 we need only look at the number of parties in the british or canadian systems  both of which are winner  take  all plurality systems like that in the united states  to see that it is possible to have more than two parties while still directly electing representatives
__label__0 for example  people who describe themselves as evangelical christians are an important republican constituency  they are also strongly opposed to abortion
__label__0 aaron blake   the ten most loyal demographic groups for republicans and democrats   the washington post   april
__label__0 thus  even though the majority of us adults believe abortion should be legal in at least some instances  such as when a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest  or threatens the life of the mother  the position of many republican presidential candidates in  was to oppose abortion in all cases
__label__0 irin carmon   gop candidates  ban abortion  no exceptions    august   httpwwwmsnbccommsnbcgopcandidatesbanabortionnoexceptions  march
__label__0 as a result  many women view the republican party as unsympathetic to their interests and are more likely to support democratic candidates
__label__0 aaron blake   the ten most loyal demographic groups for republicans and democrats
__label__0 similarly  or simultaneously   groups that have felt that the party has served their causes in the past may decide to look elsewhere if they feel their needs are no longer being met
__label__0 either way  the party system will be upended as a result of a party realignment  or a shifting of party allegiances within the electorate   link    v o key
__label__0 that change began with the  presidential campaign of franklin delano roosevelt
__label__0 fdr determined that his best path toward victory was to create a new coalition based not on region or ethnicity  but on the suffering of those hurt the most during the great depression
__label__0 at its most basic level  being a member of the party  in  the  electorate simply means a voter is more likely to voice support for a party
__label__0 these voters are often called party identifiers  since they usually represent themselves in public as being members of a party  and they may attend some party events or functions
__label__0 party identifiers are also more likely to provide financial support for the candidates of their party during election season
__label__0 second  the state organization is also responsible for drafting a state platform that serves as a policy guide for partisans who are eventually selected to public office
__label__0 these platforms are usually the result of a negotiation between the various coalitions within the party and are designed to ensure that everyone in the party will receive some benefits if their candidates win the election
__label__0 this has been particularly true for the democratic party
__label__0 in   the democrats tapped arkansas governor bill clinton to introduce their nominee michael dukakis at the convention
__label__0 clinton s speech was lampooned for its length and lack of focus  but it served to get his name in front of democratic voters
__label__0 if the issue is important enough to voters  as in the case of gun control or abortion rights  an office holder may feel his or her job will be in jeopardy if he or she too closely follows the party line  even if that means disagreeing with the executive
__label__0 a good example occurred when the civil rights act of   which desegregated public accommodations and prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race  was introduced in congress
__label__0 the bill was supported by presidents john f kennedy and lyndon johnson  both of whom were democrats
__label__0 the problem of majority versus minority politics is particularly acute under conditions of divided government
__label__1 divided government occurs when one or more houses of the legislature are controlled by the party in opposition to the executive
__label__0 recently  however  a new voice has emerged that has allied itself with the republican party
__label__0 born in part from an older third  party movement known as the libertarian party  the tea party is more hostile to government and views government intervention in all forms  and especially taxation and the regulation of business  as a threat to capitalism and democracy
__label__0 it is less willing to tolerate interventions in the market place  even when they are designed to protect the markets themselves
__label__0 scholars agree that some degree of polarization is occurring in the united states  even if some contend it is only at the elite level
__label__0 but they are less certain about exactly why  or how  polarization has become such a mainstay of american politics
__label__0 the first advance came with the introduction of the  one  person  one  vote  principle by the us supreme court in
__label__0 before then  it was common for many states to practice redistricting  or redrawing of their electoral maps  only if they gained or lost seats in the us house of representatives
__label__0 this can happen once every ten years as a result of a constitutionally mandated reapportionment process  in which the number of house seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes
__label__0 several states therefore had to make dramatic changes to their electoral maps during the next two redistricting cycles     and
__label__0 map designers  no longer certain how to protect individual party members  changed tactics to try and create safe seats so members of their party could be assured of winning by a comfortable margin
__label__0 the basic rule of thumb was that designers sought to draw districts in which their preferred party had a  percent or better chance of winning a given district  regardless of which candidate the party nominated
__label__0 that is where political parties come in
__label__1 essentially  political parties are groups of people with similar interests who work together to create and implement policies
__label__0 they do this by gaining control over the government by winning elections
__label__0 chapel hill  nc  unc press
__label__0 the federalist faction  led by alexander hamilton  largely dominated the government in the years immediately after the constitution was ratified
__label__0 included in the federalists was president george washington  who was initially against the existence of parties in the united states
__label__0 when washington decided to exit politics and leave office  he warned of the potential negative effects of parties in his farewell address to the nation  including their potentially divisive nature and the fact that they might not always focus on the common good but rather on partisan ends
__label__0 in the election of   numerous candidates contended for the presidency  all members of the democratic  republican party
__label__0 andrew jackson won more popular votes and more votes in the electoral college than any other candidate
__label__1 however  because he did not win the majority  more than half  of the available electoral votes  the election was decided by the house of representatives  as required by the twelfth amendment
__label__0 one half  called simply the democratic party  was the party of jackson  it continued to advocate for the common people by championing westward expansion and opposing a national bank
__label__0 the branch of the democratic  republicans that believed that the national government should encourage economic  primarily industrial  development was briefly known as the national republicans and later became the whig party
__label__0 at various points in the past  years  elites and voters have sought to create alternatives to the existing party system
__label__1 political parties that are formed as alternatives to the republican and democratic parties are known as third parties  or minor parties   link
__label__0 in   a third party known as the populist party formed in reaction to what its constituents perceived as the domination of us society by big business and a decline in the power of farmers and rural communities
__label__0 wallace s campaign was a failure  largely because most people believed his policies  including national healthcare  were too much like those of communism  and this party also vanished
__label__1 the other third party  the states  rights democrats  also known as the dixiecrats  were white  southern democrats who split from the democratic party when harry truman  who favored civil rights for african americans  became the party s nominee for president
__label__0 the dixiecrats opposed all attempts by the federal government to end segregation  extend voting rights  prohibit discrimination in employment  or otherwise promote social equality among races
__label__0 platform of the states rights democratic party   httpwwwpresidencyucsbedu  wspid  march
__label__0 they remained a significant party that threatened democratic unity throughout the s and s
__label__0 in federalist no   james madison warned of the dangers of  factions   minorities who would organize around issues they felt strongly about  possibly to the detriment of the majority
__label__0 but madison believed limiting these factions was worse than facing the evils they might produce  because such limitations would violate individual freedoms
__label__0 largely for this reason  there is no comprehensive list of all interest groups to tell us how many there are in the united states
__label__0 estimates of the number vary widely  suggesting that if we use a broad definition and include all interests at all levels of government  there may be more than
__label__0 nownes  interest groups in american politics
__label__0 following the passage of the lobbying disclosure act in   we had a much better understanding of the number of interests registered in washington  dc  however  it was not until several years later that we had a complete count and categorization of the interests registered in each of the fifty states
__label__0 jennifer wolak  adam j newmark  todd mcnoldy  david lowery  and virginia gray   much of politics is still local  multistate representation in state interest communities   legislative studies quarterly
__label__0 governments such as municipalities and executive departments such as the department of education register to lobby in an effort to maximize their share of budgets or increase their level of autonomy
__label__0 these government institutions are represented by a legislative liaison  whose job is to present issues to decision  makers
__label__0 for example  a state university usually employs a lobbyist  legislative liaison  or government affairs person to represent its interests before the legislature
__label__0 many lobbyists also use outside lobbying or indirect lobbying tactics  whereby the interest attempts to get its message out to the public
__label__0 ken kollman
__label__0 on the other hand  public interest groups attempt to promote public  or collective  goods
__label__0 such collective goods are benefits  tangible or intangible  that help most or all citizens
__label__1 the answer is that they likely prefer to do something else and realize they can receive the same grade as the rest of the group without contributing to the effort
__label__1 this result is often termed the free rider problem  because some individuals can receive benefits  get a free ride  without helping to bear the cost
__label__0 when national public radio  npr  engages in a fund  raising effort to help maintain the station  many listeners will not contribute
__label__0 similarly  purposive incentives focus on the issues or causes promoted by the group
__label__0 someone concerned about protecting individual rights might join a group like the american civil liberties union  aclu  because it supports the liberties guaranteed in the us constitution  even the free expression of unpopular viewshttpswwwacluorg  march
__label__0 members of the aclu sometimes find the messages of those they defend  including nazis and the ku klux klan  deplorable  but they argue that the principle of protecting civil liberties is critical to us democracy
__label__0 more recently  several shooting deaths of unarmed young african american men have raised awareness of racial issues in the united states and potential problems in policing practices
__label__0 in   ferguson  missouri  erupted in protests and riots following a decision not to indict darren wilson  a white police officer  in the fatal shooting of michael brown  who had allegedly been involved in a theft at a local convenience store and ended up in a dispute with the officer
__label__0 hundreds of ferguson protesters march in downtown dc   httpwwwnbcwashingtoncomnewslocalfergusonprotestsplannedfordcbaltimoretuesdayhtml  march
__label__0 the incident mobilized groups representing civil rights  such as the protestors in  link   as well as others supporting the interests of police officers
__label__0 individually  the protestors would likely have received little notice  but by joining with others  they drew substantial attention in the media and from lawmakers   link
__label__0 while the tea party movement might not meet the definition of interest groups presented earlier  its aims have been promoted by established interest groups
__label__0 other opportunities for participation that interest groups offer or encourage include voting  campaigning  contacting lawmakers  and informing the public about causes
__label__0 according to political scientists jeffrey berry and clyde wilcox  interest groups provide a means of representing people and serve as a link between them and government
__label__0 see in general jeffrey m berry and clyde wilcox
__label__0 how do these observations translate into the way different interests are represented in the political system
__label__0 some pluralist scholars like david truman suggest that people naturally join groups and that there will be a great deal of competition for access to decision  makers  david b truman
__label__0 the governmental process  political interests and public opinion
__label__0 today  the debate about interest groups often revolves around whether the first amendment protects the rights of individuals and groups to give money  and whether government can regulate the use of this money
__label__1 in   the federal election campaign act was passed  setting limits on how much presidential and vice  presidential candidates and their families could donate to their own campaigns
__label__0 wright  interest groups and congress  lobbying  contributions  and influence  rozell  wilcox  and franz  interest groups in american campaigns  the new face of electioneering
__label__0 the law also allowed corporations and unions to form pacs and required public disclosure of campaign contributions and their sources
__label__0 in   the act was amended in an attempt to limit the amount of money spent on congressional campaigns
__label__0 however  at the same time  it overturned restrictions on expenditures by candidates and their families  as well as total expenditures by campaigns
__label__0 buckley v valeo       us
__label__1 in   an exemption was granted to get  out  the vote and grassroots voter registration drives  creating what has become known as the soft  money loophole  soft money was a way in which interests could spend money on behalf of candidates without being restricted by federal law
__label__0 to close this loophole  senators john mccain and russell feingold sponsored the bipartisan campaign reform act in  to ban parties from collecting and distributing unregulated money
__label__0 conservative billionaires charles and david koch have become increasingly active in us elections in recent years
__label__0 these brothers run koch industries  a multinational corporation that manufactures and produces a number of products including paper  plastics  petroleum  based products  and chemicals
__label__0 the need to strictly regulate the actions of lobbyists became especially relevant after the activities of lobbyist jack abramoff were brought to light   link
__label__0 a prominent lobbyist with ties to many of the republican members of congress  abramoff used funds provided by his clients to fund reelection campaigns  pay for trips  and hire the spouses of members of congress
__label__0 large states  like virginia  felt it would be unfair to continue with this style of legislative institution
__label__1 as a result  virginia s delegates proposed a plan that called for bicameralism  or the division of legislators into two separate assemblies
__label__0 in this proposed two  chamber congress  states with larger populations would have more representatives in each chamber
__label__0 the bicameral system established at the constitutional convention and still followed today requires the two houses to pass identical bills  or proposed items of legislation
__label__0 this ensures that after all amending and modifying has occurred  the two houses ultimately reach an agreement about the legislation they send to the president
__label__0 attempts at african american disenfranchisement continued until the civil rights struggle of the s finally brought about the voting rights act of
__label__0 the act cleared several final hurdles to voter registration and voting for african americans
__label__1 an enumerated power is a power explicitly stated in the constitution
__label__1 an implied power is one not specifically detailed in the constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government
__label__1 and an inherent power  while not enumerated or implied  must be assumed to exist as a direct result of the country s existence
__label__0 these include congress s sole power to introduce legislation  the senate s final say on many presidential nominations and treaties signed by the president  and the house s ability to impeach or formally accuse the president or other federal officials of wrongdoing  the first step in removing the person from office  the second step  trial and removal  takes place in the us senate
__label__0 each of these powers also grants congress oversight of the actions of the president and his or her administration  that is  the right to review and monitor other bodies such as the executive branch
__label__0 the fact that congress has the sole power to introduce legislation effectively limits the power of the president to develop the same laws he or she is empowered to enforce
__label__0 in the early days of the republic  congress s role was rarely if ever disputed
__label__1 however  with its decision in marbury v madison     the supreme court asserted its authority over judicial review and assumed the power to declare laws unconstitutional
__label__0 marbury v madison   us
__label__0 yet  even after that decision  the court was reluctant to use this power and did nt do so for over half a century
__label__0 initially  the presidency was also a fairly weak branch of government compared with the legislature
__label__0 his popularity and his ability to be elected four times allowed him to greatly overshadow congress
__label__0 as a result  congress attempted to restrain the power of the presidency by proposing the twenty  second amendment to the constitution  which limited a president to only two full terms in office
__label__0 david m jordan
__label__0 
__label__0 another handful of reform attempts were therefore pushed through in the wake of world war ii  but then congress neglected campaign finance reform for a few decades
__label__0 that lull ended in the early s when the federal election campaign act was passed
__label__0 among other things  it created the federal election commission  fec   required candidates to disclose where their money was coming from and where they were spending it  limited individual contributions  and provided for public financing of presidential campaigns
__label__0 in the wake of the citizens united decision  a new type of advocacy group emerged  the super pac
__label__0 a traditional pac is an organization designed to raise hard money to elect or defeat candidates
__label__0 political scientists have taken note of some voting patterns that appear to challenge this common assumption  however
__label__0 in   political scientist angus campbell proposed the surge  and  decline theory to explain these patterns
__label__0 angus campbell
__label__0 
__label__0 these are generally referred to as the majority and minority leaders
__label__0 the minority leader has a visible if not always a powerful position
__label__0 as the official leader of the opposition  he or she technically holds the rank closest to that of the speaker  makes strategy decisions  and attempts to keep order within the minority
__label__0 apart from this and very few other exceptions  the president of the senate does not actually operate in the senate
__label__0 instead  the constitution allows for the senate to choose a president pro tempore  usually the most senior senator of the majority party  who presides over the senate
__label__0 despite the title  the job is largely a formal and powerless role
__label__0 however  joint committees have no bill  referral authority whatsoever  they are informational only
__label__1 a conference committee is used to reconcile different bills passed in both the house and the senate
__label__0 the conference committees are appointed on an ad hoc basis as necessary when a bill passes the house and senate in different forms
__label__0 once legislation has been proposed  however  the majority leadership consults with the parliamentarian about which committee to send it to
__label__1 each chamber has a parliamentarian  an advisor  typically a trained lawyer  who has studied the long and complex rules of the chamber
__label__0 after the civil war  the use of the filibuster became even more common
__label__0 eventually  in   the senate passed rule   which allowed the chamber to hold a cloture vote to end debate
__label__0 to invoke cloture  the senate had to get a two  thirds majority
__label__0 but they have largely been overshadowed by the outright ridiculous and sometimes racist filibusters of the twentieth century
__label__0 in the first category  the fifteen  and  a  half  hour marathon of senator huey long of louisiana stands out  hoping to retain the need for senate confirmation of some jobs he wanted to keep from his political enemies  long spent much of his filibuster analyzing the constitution  talking about his favorite recipes  and telling amusing stories  as was his custom
__label__0 hitching a ride  omnibus legislating in the us congress
__label__0 columbus  oh  ohio state university press
__label__0 creating and voting for an omnibus bill allows congress to quickly accomplish policy changes that would have taken many votes and the expending of great political capital over a long period of time
__label__0 this and successive similar uses of the budget process convinced many in congress of the utility of this strategy
__label__0 therefore  they  and their staff members  rely on interest groups and lobbyists to provide them with information about the technical details of policy proposals  as well as about fellow lawmakers  stands and constituents  perceptions
__label__0 these voting cues give lawmakers an indication of how to vote on issues  particularly those with which they are unfamiliar
__label__0 but lawmakers also rely on lobbyists for information about ideas they can champion and that will benefit them when they run for reelection
__label__0 wright  interest groups and congress  lobbying  contributions  and influence
__label__0 this means they are intended to be drawn from local populations around the country so they can speak for and make decisions for those local populations  their constituents  while serving in their respective legislative houses
__label__0 that is  representation refers to an elected leader s looking out for his or her constituents while carrying out the duties of the office
__label__0 steven s smith
__label__0 instead  most find themselves attempting to balance the important principles embedded in each
__label__0 political scientists call this the politico model of representation
__label__1 in it  members of congress act as either trustee or delegate based on rational political calculations about who is best served  the constituency or the nation
__label__0 many advances in women s rights have been the result of women s greater engagement in politics and representation in the halls of government  especially since the founding of the national organization for women in  and the national women s political caucus  nwpc  in
__label__0 the nwpc was formed by bella abzug   link    gloria steinem  shirley chisholm  and other leading feminists to encourage women s participation in political parties  elect women to office  and raise money for their campaigns
__label__0 for example  patsy mink  d  hi    link    the first asian american woman elected to congress  was the coauthor of the education amendments act of   title ix of which prohibits sex discrimination in education
__label__0 in the wake of the civil rights movement  african american representatives also began to enter congress in increasing numbers
__label__0 in   to better represent their interests  these representatives founded the congressional black caucus  cbc   an organization that grew out of a democratic select committee formed in
__label__0 founding members of the cbc include john conyers  d  mi   currently the longest  serving member of the house of representatives  charles rangel  d  ny   and shirley chisholm  a founder of the nwpc and the first african american woman to be elected to the house of representatives   link
__label__1 the concept of collective representation describes the relationship between congress and the united states as a whole
__label__0 that is  it considers whether the institution itself represents the american people  not just whether a particular member of congress represents his or her district
__label__0 the articles of confederation made no provision for an executive branch  although they did use the term  president  to designate the presiding officer of the confederation congress  who also handled other administrative duties
__label__0 articles of confederation  article xi
__label__0 the presidency was proposed early in the constitutional convention in philadelphia by virginia s edmund randolph  as part of james madison s proposal for a federal government  which became known as the virginia plan
__label__0 madison offered a rather sketchy outline of the executive branch  leaving open whether what he termed the  national executive  would be an individual or a set of people
__label__0 alexander hamilton  a   who had served under general george washington  b  during the revolutionary war  argued for a strong executive in federalist no
__label__0 to win the presidency or vice presidency  a candidate must get  electoral votes  a majority
__label__0 george w bush and dick cheney won by the skin of their teeth with just
__label__0 both  however  were living in texas
__label__0 article ii of the constitution lays out the agreed  upon requirements  the chief executive must be at least thirty  five years old and a  natural born  citizen of the united states  or a citizen at the time of the constitution s adoption  who has been an inhabitant of the united states for at least fourteen years
__label__0 us constitution  article ii  section
__label__0 while article ii also states that the term of office is four years and does not expressly limit the number of times a person might be elected president  after franklin d roosevelt was elected four times  from  to    the twenty  second amendment was proposed and ratified  limiting the presidency to two four  year terms
__label__0 in the wake of the civil war  president andrew johnson faced congressional contempt for decisions made during reconstruction
__label__0 president richard nixon faced an overwhelming likelihood of impeachment in the house for his cover  up of key information relating to the  break  in at the democratic party s campaign headquarters at the watergate hotel and apartment complex
__label__0 nixon likely would have also been removed by the senate  since there was strong bipartisan consensus for his impeachment and removal
__label__0 no sooner had the presidency been established than the occupants of the office  starting with george washington  began acting in ways that expanded both its formal and informal powers
__label__0 for example  washington established a cabinet or group of advisors to help him administer his duties  consisting of the most senior appointed officers of the executive branch
__label__0 today  the heads of the fifteen executive departments serve as the president s advisers
__label__0 httpswwwjusticegovabout  may
__label__0 and  in   when it became important for the united states to take a stand in the evolving european conflicts between france and other european powers  especially great britain  washington issued a neutrality proclamation that extended his rights as diplomat  in  chief far more broadly than had at first been conceived
__label__0 concerned that he might be violating the powers of the office  jefferson rationalized that his not facing impeachment charges constituted congress s tacit approval of his actions
__label__0 james monroe used his annual message in  to declare that the united states would consider it an intolerable act of aggression for european powers to intervene in the affairs of the nations of the western hemisphere
__label__0 later dubbed the monroe doctrine  this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of american power in the twentieth century
__label__0 of the many ways in which the chief executive s power grew over the first several decades  the most significant was the expansion of presidential war powers
__label__0 while washington  adams  and jefferson led the way in waging undeclared wars  it was president james k polk who truly set the stage for the broad growth of this authority
__label__0 in   as the united states and mexico were bickering over the messy issue of where texas s southern border lay  polk purposely raised anxieties and ruffled feathers through his envoy in mexico
__label__0 later  however  as president himself  lincoln used presidential war powers and the concepts of military necessity and national security to undermine the confederate effort to seek independence for the southern states
__label__0 in suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus  lincoln blurred the boundaries between acceptable dissent and unacceptable disloyalty
__label__0 he also famously used a unilateral proclamation to issue the emancipation proclamation  which cited the military necessity of declaring millions of slaves in confederate  controlled territory to be free
__label__0 over the course of the twentieth century  presidents expanded and elaborated upon these powers
__label__0 the rather vague wording in article ii  which says that the  executive power shall be vested  in the president  has been subject to broad and sweeping interpretation in order to justify actions beyond those specifically enumerated in the document
__label__0 us constitution  article ii  section
__label__0 as the federal bureaucracy expanded  so too did the president s power to grow agencies like the secret service and the federal bureau of investigation
__label__0 more recently  presidents have offered their own interpretation of legislation as they sign it via signing statements  discussed later in this chapter  directed to the bureaucratic entity charged with implementation
__label__0 in the realm of foreign policy  congress permitted the widespread use of executive agreements to formalize international relations  so long as important matters still came through the senate in the form of treaties

__label__0 neither ronald reagan nor bill clinton was especially popular with the party leadership of the republicans or the democrats  respectively  at the outset
__label__0 the outsider phenomenon has been most clearly demonstrated  however  in the  presidential nominating process  as those distrusted by the party establishment  such as senator ted cruz and donald trump  who never before held political office  raced ahead of party favorites like jeb bush early in the primary process   link
__label__0 senator ted cruz  r  tx   though disliked by the party establishment  was able to rise to the top in the iowa caucuses in  because of his ability to reach the conservative base of the party
__label__0 ultimately  cruz bowed out of the race when donald trump effectively clinched the republican nomination in indiana in early may
__label__0 early presidential elections  conducted along the lines of the original process outlined in the constitution  proved unsatisfactory
__label__0 so long as george washington was a candidate  his election was a foregone conclusion
__label__0 but it took some manipulation of the votes of electors to ensure that the second  place winner  and thus the vice president  did not receive the same number of votes
__label__0 in several elections  such as in  and   a candidate who received less than a majority of the popular vote has claimed the presidency  including cases when the losing candidate secured a majority of the popular vote
__label__0 a recent case was the  election  in which democratic nominee al gore won the popular vote  while republican nominee george w bush won the electoral college vote and hence the presidency
__label__0 the  election brought another such irregularity as donald trump comfortably won the electoral college by narrowly winning the popular vote in several states  while hillary clinton collected nearly  million more votes nationwide
__label__0 in the immediate aftermath of the election  the incoming and outgoing administrations work together to help facilitate the transfer of power
__label__0 while the general services administration oversees the logistics of the process  such as office assignments  information technology  and the assignment of keys  prudent candidates typically prepare for a possible victory by appointing members of a transition team during the lead  up to the general election
__label__0 the success of the team s actions becomes apparent on inauguration day  when the transition of power takes place in what is often a seamless fashion  with people evacuating their offices  and the white house  for their successors
__label__0 in   president barack obama nominated former republican senator chuck hagel to run the department of defense
__label__0 the president hoped that by nominating a former senator from the opposition he could ensure the confirmation process would go smoothly
__label__0 the republican senate and judiciary committee will welcome a trump nominee in early other presidential selections are not subject to senate approval  including the president s personal staff  whose most important member is the white house chief of staff  and various advisers  most notably the national security adviser
__label__0 the executive office of the president  created by franklin d roosevelt  fdr   contains a number of advisory bodies  including the council of economic advisers  the national security council  the omb  and the office of the vice president
__label__0 presidents also choose political advisers  speechwriters  and a press secretary to manage the politics and the message of the administration
__label__0 but when they do  the constitution allows for a small presidential loophole called the recess appointment
__label__0 the relevant part of article ii  section   of the constitution reads
__label__0 the strategy was to get the ambitious politician out of the way while still taking advantage of his popularity
__label__0 this scheme backfired  however  when mckinley was assassinated and roosevelt became president   link
__label__0 sometimes  as in the case of bill clinton and al gore  the partnership appeared to be smooth if not always harmonious
__label__0 in the case of george w bush and his very experienced vice president dick cheney  observers speculated whether the vice president might have exercised too much influence

__label__0 the format that an international agreement takes has been the point of considerable discussion in recent years
__label__0 the us constitution outlines the treaty process in article ii
__label__0 the president negotiates a treaty  the senate consents to the treaty by a two  thirds vote  and finally the president ratifies it
__label__0 on the other hand  congressional  executive agreements  like the north american free trade agreement  nafta   are negotiated by the president and then approved by a simple majority of the house and senate  rather than a two  thirds vote in the senate as is the case for a treaty
__label__0 in the key case of united states v pink     the supreme court ruled that executive agreements were legally equivalent to treaties provided they did not alter federal law
__label__0 united states v pink   us
__label__0 most executive agreements are not of major importance and do not spark controversy  while some  like the iran nuclear agreement  generate considerable debate
__label__0 many in the senate thought the iran deal should have been completed as a treaty rather than as a sole executive agreement
__label__0 madeleine albright  a   the first female secretary of state  was nominated by president bill clinton and unanimously confirmed by the senate
__label__0 colin powell  b   nominated by george w bush  was also unanimously confirmed
__label__1 these sharply focused foreign policy outputs tend to be exclusively the province of the president  including the deployment of troops andor intelligence agents in a crisis  executive summits between the president and other heads of state on targeted matters of foreign policy  presidential use of military force  and emergency funding measures to deal with foreign policy crises
__label__0 these measures of foreign policy are more quickly enacted and demonstrate the  energy and dispatch  that alexander hamilton  writing in the federalist papers  saw as inherent in the institution of the presidency
__label__0 emergency spending does involve congress through its power of the purse  but congress tends to give presidents what they need to deal with emergencies
__label__0 probably the most extreme version of this potential dynamic occurred during the eisenhower presidency
__label__0 when president dwight d eisenhower used too many executive agreements instead of sending key ones to the senate as treaties  congress reacted by considering a constitutional amendment  the bricker amendment  that would have altered the treaty process as we know it
__label__0 eisenhower understood the message and began to send more agreements through the process as treaties

__label__0 first  congressional party leaders in the majority and minority parties speak on behalf of their institution and their party on all types of issues  including foreign policy
__label__1 some house and senate members ask to serve on the foreign policy committees  such as the senate committee on foreign relations  the house foreign affairs committee  and the two defense committees   link
__label__0 these members might have military bases within their districts or states and hence have a constituency reason for being interested in foreign policy

__label__0 also reporting to the president in the white house is the director of the central intelligence agency  cia
__label__0 even more important on intelligence than the cia director is the director of national intelligence  a position created in the government reorganizations after   who oversees the entire intelligence community in the us government
__label__0 the end of the cold war opened up old wounds as a variety of smaller european countries sought independence and old ethnic conflicts reappeared
__label__0 some in the united states felt the country should again be isolationist as the world settled into a new political arrangement  including a vocal senator  jesse helms  r  nc   who was against the united states continuing to be the military  policeman  of the world
__label__0 helms was famous for opposing nearly all treaties brought to the senate during his tenure
__label__0 there is an element of idealism in liberal internationalism  because the united states assumes other countries will also put their best foot forward
__label__0 a classic example of a liberal internationalist is president woodrow wilson  who sought a league of nations to voluntarily save the world after world war i
__label__0 neoconservatives believe that rather than exercising restraint and always using international organizations as the path to international outcomes  the united states should aggressively use its might to promote its values and ideals around the world
__label__1 the aggressive use  or threat  of hard power is the core value of neoconservatism
__label__0 acting unilaterally is acceptable in this view  as is adopting a preemptive strategy in which the united states intervenes militarily before the enemy can make its move
__label__0 in   mexican american parents in california  with the assistance of the naacp  sued several california school districts that forced mexican and mexican american children to attend segregated schools

__label__0 in   the american psychological association ended its classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder
__label__0 in   the us military adopted the policy of  do nt ask  do nt tell
__label__1 this act  department of defense directive   officially prohibited discrimination against suspected gays  lesbians  and bisexuals by the us military
__label__0 it also prohibited superior officers from asking about or investigating the sexual orientation of those below them in rank
__label__0 public law     national defense authorization act for fiscal year
__label__0 however  those gays  lesbians  and bisexuals who spoke openly about their sexual orientation were still subject to dismissal because it remained illegal for anyone except heterosexuals to serve in the armed forces
__label__0 the legalization of same  sex marriage throughout the united states led some people to feel their religious beliefs were under attack  and many religiously conservative business owners have refused to acknowledge lbgt rights or the legitimacy of same  sex marriages
__label__0 following swiftly upon the heels of the obergefell ruling  the indiana legislature passed a religious freedom restoration act  rfra

__label__0 by far  the most well  known dissociative disorder is dissociative identity disorder  formerly called multiple personality disorder
__label__1 people with dissociative identity disorder exhibit two or more separate personalities or identities  each well  defined and distinct from one another
__label__1 delusions are beliefs that are contrary to reality and are firmly held even in the face of contradictory evidence
__label__0 many of us hold beliefs that some would consider odd  but a delusion is easily identified because it is clearly absurd
__label__1 disorganized or abnormal motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements  becoming unusually active  exhibiting silly child  like behaviors  giggling and self  absorbed smiling   engaging in repeated and purposeless movements  or displaying odd facial expressions and gestures
__label__1 in some cases  the person will exhibit catatonic behaviors  which show decreased reactivity to the environment  such as posturing  in which the person maintains a rigid and bizarre posture for long periods of time  or catatonic stupor  a complete lack of movement and verbal behavior
__label__0 brain imaging studies reveal that people with schizophrenia have enlarged ventricles  the cavities within the brain that contain cerebral spinal fluid  green
__label__0 this finding is important because larger than normal ventricles suggests that various brain regions are reduced in size  thus implying that schizophrenia is associated with a loss of brain tissue
__label__0 extremely stressful or traumatic events  such as combat  natural disasters  and terrorist attacks  place the people who experience them at an increased risk for developing psychological disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder  ptsd
__label__0 throughout much of the th century  this disorder was called shell shock and combat neurosis because its symptoms were observed in soldiers who had engaged in wartime combat
__label__0 the dsm recognizes  personality disorders  organized into  different clusters
__label__1 cluster a disorders include paranoid personality disorder  schizoid personality disorder  and schizotypal personality disorder
__label__0 people with these disorders display a personality style that is odd or eccentric
__label__0 the  borderline  in borderline personality disorder was originally coined in the late s in an effort to describe patients who appeared anxious  but were prone to brief psychotic experiences  that is  patients who were thought to be literally on the borderline between anxiety and psychosis  freeman  stone  martin   reinecke
__label__0 today  borderline personality disorder has a completely different meaning
__label__1 borderline personality disorder is characterized chiefly by instability in interpersonal relationships  self  image  and mood  as well as marked impulsivity  apa
__label__0 the dsm lists two general categories of mood disorders
__label__1 depressive disorders are a group of disorders in which depression is the main feature
__label__1 depression is a vague term that  in everyday language  refers to an intense and persistent sadness
__label__1 according to the dsm  the defining symptoms of major depressive disorder include  depressed mood most of the day  nearly every day   feeling sad  empty  hopeless  or appearing tearful to others   and loss of interest and pleasure in usual activities  apa
__label__0 in addition to feeling overwhelmingly sad most of each day  people with depression will no longer show interest or enjoyment in activities that previously were gratifying  such as hobbies  sports  sex  social events  time spent with family  and so on
__label__1 another subtype  peripartum onset  commonly referred to as postpartum depression   applies to women who experience major depression during pregnancy or in the four weeks following the birth of their child  apa
__label__0 these women often feel very anxious and may even have panic attacks
__label__1 to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder  a person must have experienced a manic episode at least once in his life  although major depressive episodes are common in bipolar disorder  they are not required for a diagnosis  apa
__label__1 according to the dsm  a manic episode is characterized as a  distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated  expansive  or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy lasting at least one week   that lasts most of the time each day  apa    p
__label__0 during a manic episode  some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative  sometimes spontaneously starting conversations with strangers  others become excessively irritable and complain or make hostile comments
__label__0 overwhelmed by hopelessness  devastated by incapacitating feelings of worthlessness  and burdened with the inability to adequately cope with such feelings  they may consider suicide to be a reasonable way out
__label__1 suicide  defined by the cdc as  death caused by self  directed injurious behavior with any intent to die as the result of the behavior   cdc  a   in a sense represents an outcome of several things going wrong all at the same time crosby  ortega   melanson
__label__0 not only must the person be biologically or psychologically vulnerable  but he must also have the means to perform the suicidal act  and he must lack the necessary protective factors  eg  social support from friends and family  religion  coping skills  and problem  solving skills  that provide comfort and enable one to cope during times of crisis or great psychological pain  berman
__label__1 an individual with body dysmorphic disorder is preoccupied with a perceived flaw in her physical appearance that is either nonexistent or barely noticeable to other people  apa
__label__0 these perceived physical defects cause the person to think she is unattractive  ugly  hideous  or deformed
__label__0 the symptoms of ocd have been theorized to be learned responses  acquired and sustained as the result of a combination of two forms of learning  classical conditioning and operant conditioning  mowrer    steinmetz  tracy   green
__label__0 specifically  the acquisition of ocd may occur first as the result of classical conditioning  whereby a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus that provokes anxiety or distress
__label__1 social anxiety disorder  formerly called social phobia  is characterized by extreme and persistent fear or anxiety and avoidance of social situations in which the person could potentially be evaluated negatively by others  apa
__label__0 as with specific phobias  social anxiety disorder is common in the united states  a little over   of all americans experience social anxiety disorder during their lifetime  kessler et al
__label__0 groups of people would suddenly begin to dance with wild abandon
__label__0 this compulsion to dance  referred to as dancing mania  sometimes gripped thousands of people at a time   link
__label__0 historical accounts indicate that those afflicted would sometimes dance with bruised and bloody feet for days or weeks  screaming of terrible visions and begging priests and monks to save their souls  waller  b
__label__1 a psychological disorder is a condition characterized by abnormal thoughts  feelings  and behaviors
__label__1 psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders  including their symptoms  etiology  ie  their causes   and treatment
__label__0 violating cultural expectations is not  in and of itself  a satisfactory means of identifying the presence of a psychological disorder
__label__0 since behavior varies from one culture to another  what may be expected and considered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures
__label__0 for example  returning a stranger s smile is expected in the united states because a pervasive social norm dictates that we reciprocate friendly gestures
__label__0 how do mental health professionals ascertain whether or not a person s inner states and behaviors truly represent a psychological disorder
__label__1 arriving at a proper diagnosis  that is  appropriately identifying and labeling a set of defined symptoms  is absolutely crucial
__label__0 this process enables professionals to use a common language with others in the field and aids in communication about the disorder with the patient  colleagues and the public
__label__0 a second classification system  the international classification of diseases  icd   is also widely recognized
__label__0 published by the world health organization  who   the icd was developed in europe shortly after world war ii and  like the dsm  has been revised several times
__label__0 in this dimension  people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers  cold  nonconformists  impulsive  antisocial  and hostile  whereas people who are high on superego control tend to have high impulse control  they are more altruistic  empathetic  cooperative  and conventional  eysenck  eysenck  barrett  while cattell s  factors may be too broad  the eysenck s two  factor system has been criticized for being too narrow
__label__0 another personality theory  called the five factor model  effectively hits a middle ground  with its five factors referred to as the big five personality traits
__label__0 it is the most popular theory in personality psychology today and the most accurate approximation of the basic trait dimensions  funder
__label__0 one explanation for the regional differences is selective migration  rentfrow et al
__label__1 selective migration is the concept that people choose to move to places that are compatible with their personalities and needs
__label__0 the rorschach inkblot test was developed in  by a swiss psychologist named hermann rorschach  pronounced  roar  shock
__label__0 it is a series of symmetrical inkblot cards that are presented to a client by a psychologist
__label__0 to address this need  robert williams developed the first culturally specific projective test designed to reflect the everyday life experiences of african americans  hoy  watkins  jenkins  moore
__label__0 the updated version of the instrument is the contemporized  themes concerning blacks test  c  tcb   williams
__label__1 each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light  which is the absorption spectrum
__label__1 the graph in  link  shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll a  chlorophyll b  and a type of carotenoid pigment called   carotene  which absorbs blue and green light
__label__0 both photosystems have the same basic structure  a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place
__label__1 each photosystem is serviced by the light  harvesting complex  which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center  it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of    chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids
__label__0 the reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules with a special property
__label__0 those two chlorophylls can undergo oxidation upon excitation  they can actually give up an electron in a process called a photoact
__label__0 it is at this step in the reaction center  this step in photosynthesis  that light energy is converted into an excited electron
__label__0 because the electrons have lost energy prior to their arrival at psi  they must be re  energized by psi  hence  another photon is absorbed by the psi antenna
__label__1 that energy is relayed to the psi reaction center  called p
__label__0 p is oxidized and sends a high  energy electron to nadp to form nadph
__label__0 that is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by pga
__label__1 recall that a reduction is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule
__label__0 six molecules of both atp and nadph are used
__label__0 an easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the latin origin of the prefixes  inter means
__label__0 chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small  usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands
__label__1 a ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule  in some cases  delivering a signal in the process
__label__0 ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules
__label__1 the junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse
__label__1 a synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells
__label__0 signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast  moving electrical impulses
__label__1 signals from distant cells are called endocrine signals  and they originate from endocrine cells
__label__0 in the body  many endocrine cells are located in endocrine glands  such as the thyroid gland  the hypothalamus  and the pituitary gland
__label__1 internal receptors  also known as intracellular or cytoplasmic receptors  are found in the cytoplasm of the cell and respond to hydrophobic ligand molecules that are able to travel across the plasma membrane
__label__0 once inside the cell  many of these molecules bind to proteins that act as regulators of mrna synthesis  transcription  to mediate gene expression
__label__1 ion channel  linked receptors bind a ligand and open a channel through the membrane that allows specific ions to pass through
__label__0 to form a channel  this type of cell  surface receptor has an extensive membrane  spanning region
__label__1 once a ligand binds to a receptor  the signal is transmitted through the membrane and into the cytoplasm
__label__0 continuation of a signal in this manner is called signal transduction
__label__0 signal transduction only occurs with cell  surface receptors because internal receptors are able to interact directly with dna in the nucleus to initiate protein synthesis
__label__0 after the ligand binds to the cell  surface receptor  the activation of the receptor s intracellular components sets off a chain of events that is called a signaling pathway or a signaling cascade
__label__1 in a signaling pathway  second messengers  enzymes  and activated proteins interact with specific proteins  which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to a change in the cell s environment   link
__label__1 second messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor
__label__0 these molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain cellular proteins
__label__1 present in small concentrations in the plasma membrane  inositol phospholipids are lipids that can also be converted into second messengers
__label__0 because these molecules are membrane components  they are located near membrane  bound receptors and can easily interact with them
__label__0 cells do not normally divide unless they are stimulated by signals from other cells
__label__1 the ligands that promote cell growth are called growth factors
__label__0 most growth factors bind to cell  surface receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases
__label__1 for example  phosphatases are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called dephosphorylation
__label__0 cyclic amp  camp  is degraded into amp by phosphodiesterase  and the release of calcium stores is reversed by the ca  pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell
__label__0 quorum sensing uses autoinducers as signaling molecules
__label__1 autoinducers are signaling molecules secreted by bacteria to communicate with other bacteria of the same kind
__label__0 the secreted autoinducers can be small  hydrophobic molecules such as acyl  homoserine lactone   ahl  or larger peptide  based molecules  each type of molecule has a different mode of action
__label__0 each species of eukaryotes has a characteristic number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells
__label__0 human body cells have  chromosomes  while human gametes  sperm or eggs  have  chromosomes each
__label__1 a typical body cell  or somatic cell  contains two matched sets of chromosomes  a configuration known as diploid
__label__1 matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous   same knowledge   chromosomes
__label__1 matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous   same knowledge   chromosomes
__label__1 homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location  or locus
__label__0 homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location  or locus
__label__1 the dna  histone complex is called chromatin
__label__1 the beadlike  histone dna complex is called a nucleosome  and dna connecting the nucleosomes is called linker dna
__label__0 a dna molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones  and the beads are about  nm in diameter  in contrast with the nm diameter of a dna double helix
__label__1 the cell cycle is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells
__label__0 cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth  dna replication  and division that produces two identical  clone  cells
__label__1 the first stage of interphase is called the g phase  first gap  because  from a microscopic aspect  little change is visible
__label__0 however  during the g stage  the cell is quite active at the biochemical level
__label__1 the two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle  the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis
__label__1 at the center of each animal cell  the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod  like objects  the centrioles  which are at right angles to each other
__label__0 centrioles help organize cell division
__label__1 karyokinesis  also known as mitosis  is divided into a series of phases  prophase  prometaphase  metaphase  anaphase  and telophase  that result in the division of the cell nucleus   link
__label__0 karyokinesis is also called mitosis
__label__1 during prometaphase  the  first change phase   many processes that were begun in prophase continue to advance
__label__0 the remnants of the nuclear envelope fragment
__label__1 during anaphase  the  upward phase   the cohesin proteins degrade  and the sister chromatids separate at the centromere
__label__0 each chromatid  now called a chromosome  is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which its microtubule is attached
__label__1 the actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward  forming a fissure
__label__0 this fissure  or  crack   is called the cleavage furrow
__label__0 the furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts  and eventually the membrane is cleaved in two   link
__label__0 in plant cells  a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells
__label__0 cells in g phase are not actively preparing to divide
__label__1 the cell is in a quiescent  inactive  stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle
__label__0 some cells enter g temporarily until an external signal triggers the onset of g
__label__0 tumor suppressor geneslike proto  oncogenes  many of the negative cell cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become cancerous
__label__1 tumor suppressor genes are segments of dna that code for negative regulator proteins  the type of regulators that  when activated  can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division
__label__1 tumor suppressor genes are segments of dna that code for negative regulator proteins  the type of regulators that  when activated  can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division
__label__0 the collective function of the best  understood tumor suppressor gene proteins  rb  p  and p  is to put up a roadblock to cell cycle progression until certain events are completed
__label__0 the best understood negative regulatory molecules are retinoblastoma protein  rb   p  and p
__label__1 retinoblastoma proteins are a group of tumor  suppressor proteins common in many cells
__label__0 after the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell  cytoplasmic separation begins
__label__0 the formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called ftsz directs the partition between the nucleoids
__label__0 formation of the ftsz ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site
__label__1 most animals and plants are diploid  containing two sets of chromosomes
__label__1 in each somatic cell of the organism  all cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells   the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome  called homologous chromosomes
__label__0 somatic cells are sometimes referred to as  body  cells
__label__0 because the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis  the same stage names are assigned
__label__0 however  because there are two rounds of division  the major process and the stages are designated with a  i  or a  ii
__label__1 thus  meiosis i is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase i  prometaphase i  and so on
__label__1 meiosis ii  in which the second round of meiotic division takes place  includes prophase ii  prometaphase ii  and so on
__label__0 in mitosis  homologous chromosomes line up end  to  end so that when they divide  each daughter cell receives a sister chromatid from both members of the homologous pair
__label__1 the synaptonemal complex  a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes  first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes
__label__1 the tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis
__label__0 located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules
__label__1 these assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover  or genetic recombination  between the non  sister chromatids
__label__1 these assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover  or genetic recombination  between the non  sister chromatids
__label__0 in some species  cells enter a brief interphase  or interkinesis  before entering meiosis ii
__label__0 interkinesis lacks an s phase  so chromosomes are not duplicated
__label__1 fertilization  the joining of two haploid gametes  restores the diploid condition
__label__1 there are three main categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms  diploid  dominant  in which the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life stage  such as with most animals including humans  haploid  dominant  in which the multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage  such as with all fungi and some algae  and alternation of generations  in which the two stages are apparent to different degrees depending on the group  as with plants and some algae
__label__1 fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote
__label__1 the zygote will undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular plant called a sporophyte
__label__0 specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores
__label__0 offspring appear to be a  blend  of their parents  traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation
__label__1 the blending theory of inheritance asserted that the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring  but we now know that this is not the case
__label__0 mendel was the first researcher to see it
__label__1 plants used in first  generation crosses were called p  or parental generation one  plants   link
__label__0 mendel collected the seeds belonging to the p plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season
__label__0 in his  publication  mendel reported the results of his crosses involving seven different characteristics  each with two contrasting traits
__label__1 a trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic
__label__0 the characteristics included plant height  seed texture  seed color  flower color  pea pod size  pea pod color  and flower position
__label__1 dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization
__label__1 recessive traits become latent  or disappear  in the offspring of a hybridization
__label__0 the recessive trait does  however  reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring
__label__0 for cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic  a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not encode the same version of that characteristic
__label__1 gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called alleles
__label__0 mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms  but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population
__label__0 the p plants that mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying
__label__0 diploid organisms that are homozygous at a given gene  or locus  have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes
__label__0 mendel s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait
__label__0 the dominant seed color is yellow  therefore  the parental genotypes were yy for the plants with yellow seeds and yy for the plants with green seeds  respectively
__label__1 a punnett square  devised by the british geneticist reginald punnett  can be drawn that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies
__label__1 a punnett square  devised by the british geneticist reginald punnett  can be drawn that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies
__label__0 to prepare a punnett square  all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the top  for one parent  and side  for the other parent  of a grid  representing their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes
__label__0 note that different genotypic abbreviations are used for mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns from simple dominance and recessiveness
__label__1 this pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance  denoting the expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an intermediate phenotype
__label__0 the allele for red flowers is incompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers
__label__0 note that when many alleles exist for the same gene  the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type  often abbreviated      this is considered the standard or norm
__label__1 all other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard  meaning that they deviate from the wild type
__label__0 the variant may be recessive or dominant to the wild  type allele
__label__0 because of the location of the eye  color gene  reciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios
__label__1 males are said to be hemizygous  because they have only one allele for any x  linked characteristic
__label__0 hemizygosity makes the descriptions of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant for xy males
__label__1 mendel s law of dominance states that in a heterozygote  one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic
__label__0 rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype  the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively
__label__1 mendel s law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes  and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur
__label__1 the independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross  a cross between two true  breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics
__label__0 consider the characteristics of seed color and seed texture for two pea plants  one that has green  wrinkled seeds  yyrr  and another that has yellow  round seeds  yyrr
__label__0 that same year  walter sutton observed the separation of chromosomes into daughter cells during meiosis   link
__label__1 together  these observations led to the development of the chromosomal theory of inheritance  which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for mendelian inheritance
__label__0 because they correspond to new allele combinations  the genotypes ab and ab are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis
__label__1 parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents
__label__0 morgan and his colleagues  however  found that when such heterozygous individuals were test crossed to a homozygous recessive parent  aabb  aabb   both parental and nonparental cases occurred
__label__0 the isolation and microscopic observation of chromosomes forms the basis of cytogenetics and is the primary method by which clinicians detect chromosomal abnormalities in humans
__label__1 a karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes  and includes their length  banding pattern  and centromere position
__label__1 to obtain a view of an individual s karyotype  cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart  or karyogram  also known as an ideogram   link
__label__1 for instance  jacobsen syndrome  which involves distinctive facial features as well as heart and bleeding defects  is identified by a deletion on chromosome
__label__1 finally  the karyotype can pinpoint translocations  which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another chromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome
__label__0 translocations are implicated in certain cancers  including chronic myelogenous leukemia
__label__1 an individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid  in humans  euploidy corresponds to  pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes
__label__1 an individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid  a term that includes monosomy  loss of one chromosome  or trisomy  gain of an extraneous chromosome
__label__1 an individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid  a term that includes monosomy  loss of one chromosome  or trisomy  gain of an extraneous chromosome
__label__0 monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they lack essential genes
__label__1 a chromosome inversion is the detachment    rotation  and reinsertion of part of a chromosome
__label__1 inversions may occur in nature as a result of mechanical shear  or from the action of transposable elements  special dna sequences capable of facilitating the rearrangement of chromosome segments with the help of enzymes that cut and paste dna sequences
__label__0 a half century later  british bacteriologist frederick griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another  horizontally   rather than by descent
__label__1 in   he reported the first demonstration of bacterial transformation  a process in which external dna is taken up by a cell  thereby changing morphology and physiology
__label__1 he was working with streptococcus pneumoniae  the bacterium that causes pneumonia
__label__0 atp hydrolysis is required for this process
__label__0 as the dna opens up  y  shaped structures called replication forks are formed
__label__0 two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi directionally as replication proceeds
__label__1 another enzyme  rna primase  synthesizes an rna primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the dna
__label__0 because this sequence primes the dna synthesis  it is appropriately called the primer
__label__0 dna polymerase can now extend this rna primer  adding nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand   link
__label__0 okazaki fragments are named after the japanese scientist who first discovered them
__label__1 the strand with the okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand
__label__0 the primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of dna pol i  and the gaps are filled in by deoxyribonucleotides
__label__1 the nicks that remain between the newly synthesized dna  that replaced the rna primer  and the previously synthesized dna are sealed by the enzyme dna ligase that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkage between the oh end of one nucleotide and the   phosphate end of the other fragment
__label__1 in another type of repair mechanism  nucleotide excision repair  enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both the   and   ends of the incorrect base   link
__label__0 the segment of dna is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides by the action of dna pol
__label__1 induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals  uv rays  x  rays  or some other environmental agent
__label__1 spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent  they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body
__label__0 these can be of two types  either transitions or transversions
__label__1 transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind  for example  a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine
__label__1 transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine  or vice versa  for example  cytosine  a pyrimidine  is replaced by adenine  a purine
__label__0 the discovery of the enzyme telomerase   link   helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained
__label__1 the telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built  in rna template
__label__0 it attaches to the end of the chromosome  and complementary bases to the rna template are added on the   end of the dna strand
__label__0 in contrast  there are  possible nucleotide triplets     which is far more than the number of amino acids
__label__0 scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was degenerate
__label__0 in other words  a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet
__label__1 in addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain  three of the  codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery
__label__0 these triplets are called nonsense codons  or stop codons
__label__0 another codon  aug  also has a special function
__label__1 the region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble
__label__1 transcription always proceeds from the same dna strand for each gene  which is called the template strand
__label__0 the mrna product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other dna strand  called the nontemplate strand
__label__0 the only difference is that in mrna  all of the t nucleotides are replaced with u nucleotides
__label__0 nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream
__label__1 conversely  nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with    numbering and are called downstream nucleotides
__label__1 a promoter is a dna sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription
__label__0 in most cases  promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate
__label__0 rho  independent termination is controlled by specific sequences in the dna template strand
__label__0 as the polymerase nears the end of the gene being transcribed  it encounters a region rich in c  g nucleotides
__label__0 these pseudogenes are copied from mrna and incorporated into the chromosome
__label__0 for example  the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved caat box  ggccaatct  at approximately
__label__0 this sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors
__label__0 for polynucleotide synthesis to occur  the transcription machinery needs to move histones out of the way every time it encounters a nucleosome
__label__1 this is accomplished by a special protein complex called fact  which stands for  facilitates chromatin transcription   this complex pulls histones away from the dna template as the polymerase moves along it
__label__0 once the pre  mrna is synthesized  the fact complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes
__label__0 
__label__1 the initiator trna interacts with the start codon aug  or rarely  gug   links to a formylated methionine called fmet  and can also bind if
__label__0 formylated methionine is inserted by
__label__1 peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the a  site trna and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the p  site trna
__label__1 the formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase  an rna  based enzyme that is integrated into the s ribosomal subunit
__label__0 the energy for each peptide bond formation is derived from gtp hydrolysis  which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor
__label__0 while the pre  mrna is still being synthesized  a methylguanosine cap is added to the   end of the growing transcript by a phosphate linkage
__label__1 this moiety  functional group  protects the nascent mrna from degradation
__label__0 if the process errs by even a single nucleotide  the reading frame of the rejoined exons would shift  and the resulting protein would be dysfunctional
__label__1 the process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called splicing   link
__label__0 introns are removed and degraded while the pre  mrna is still in the nucleus
__label__0 the regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process   link
__label__1 regulation may occur when the dna is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors  epigenetic level   when the rna is transcribed  transcriptional level   when the rna is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed  post  transcriptional level   when the rna is translated into protein  translational level   or after the protein has been made  post  translational level
__label__0 coli need amino acids to survive
__label__0 tryptophan is one such amino acid that e coli can ingest from the environment
__label__0 a dna sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the promoter region and the first trp coding gene
__label__1 this operator contains the dna code to which the repressor protein can bind
__label__0 when tryptophan is present in the cell  two tryptophan molecules bind to the trp repressor  which changes shape to bind to the trp operator
__label__0 coli
__label__1 when glucose levels decline in the cell  accumulating camp binds to the positive regulator catabolite activator protein  cap   a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control the processing of alternative sugars
__label__0 when camp binds to cap  the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources   link
__label__0 if a gene is to be transcribed  the histone proteins and dna are modified surrounding the chromosomal region encoding that gene
__label__0 this opens the chromosomal region to allow access for rna polymerase and other proteins  called transcription factors  to bind to the promoter region  located just upstream of the gene  and initiate transcription
__label__0 if a gene is to remain turned off  or silenced  the histone proteins and dna have different modifications that signal a closed chromosomal configuration
__label__1 in some eukaryotic genes  there are regions that help increase or enhance transcription
__label__0 these regions  called enhancers  are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance
__label__0 they can be located upstream of a gene  within the coding region of the gene  downstream of a gene  or may be thousands of nucleotides away
__label__0 if the rna is stable  it will be detected for longer periods of time in the cytoplasm  binding of proteins to the rna can influence its stability
__label__1 proteins  called rna  binding proteins  or rbps  can bind to the regions of the rna just upstream or downstream of the protein  coding region
__label__1 these regions in the rna that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated regions  or utrs
__label__0 in addition to rbps that bind to and control  increase or decrease  rna stability  other elements called micrornas can bind to the rna molecule
__label__1 these micrornas  or mirnas  are short rna molecules that are only    nucleotides in length
__label__0 the mirnas are made in the nucleus as longer pre  mirnas
__label__0 like transcription  translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate the process
__label__1 in translation  the complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex
__label__1 the first protein to bind to the rna to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor  eif
__label__0 the eif protein is active when it binds to the high  energy molecule guanosine triphosphate  gtp
__label__1 gtp provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate  gdp
__label__0 the eif protein bound to gtp binds to the small s ribosomal subunit
__label__1 ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is complete
__label__1 these proteins are moved to the proteasome  an organelle that functions to remove proteins  to be degraded   link
__label__0 one way to control gene expression  therefore  is to alter the longevity of the protein
__label__1 biotechnology is the use of biological agents for technological advancement
__label__0 biotechnology was used for breeding livestock and crops long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood
__label__0 because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic ph in an aqueous environment  they can be mobilized by an electric field
__label__1 gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of size  using this charge
__label__0 the nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments
__label__0 gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size
__label__1 the fragments in the gel are then transferred onto a nylon membrane in a procedure called blotting   link
__label__0 the nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences
__label__1 plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations  such as escherichia coli  and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism  such as antibiotic resistance  the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics
__label__1 plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations  such as escherichia coli  and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism  such as antibiotic resistance  the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics
__label__0 plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large  scale production of important reagents  such as insulin and human growth hormone
__label__1 plasmids with foreign dna inserted into them are called recombinant dna molecules because they are created artificially and do not occur in nature
__label__0 they are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis
__label__1 reproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism
__label__1 most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means  which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals  parents   making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent
__label__1 the organism that receives the recombinant dna is called a genetically modified organism  gmo
__label__1 if the foreign dna that is introduced comes from a different species  the host organism is called transgenic
__label__0 bacteria  plants  and animals have been genetically modified since the early s for academic  medical  agricultural  and industrial purposes
__label__1 gene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease
__label__0 in its simplest form  it involves the introduction of a good gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene
__label__1 genomics is the study of entire genomes  including the complete set of genes  their nucleotide sequence and organization  and their interactions within a species and with other species
__label__1 genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome
__label__0 the maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets
__label__0 physical maps present the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes  similar to a detailed road map
__label__1 a physical map is a representation of the physical distance  in nucleotides  between genes or genetic markers
__label__0 both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome
__label__0 some genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms  rflp   variable number of tandem repeats  vntrs   microsatellite polymorphisms  and the single nucleotide polymorphisms  snps
__label__1 rflps  sometimes pronounced  rif  lips   are detected when the dna of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease that recognizes specific sequences in the dna to generate a series of dna fragments  which are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis
__label__0 this technique overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping and is not affected by increased or decreased recombination frequency
__label__1 sequence mapping resulted from dna sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs
__label__1 the creation of genomic libraries and complementary dna  cdna  libraries  collections of cloned sequences or all dna from a genome  has sped up the process of physical mapping
__label__0 although there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years  doctors are still confounded by some diseases  and they are using whole  genome sequencing to get to the bottom of the problem
__label__1 whole  genome sequencing is a process that determines the dna sequence of an entire genome
__label__0 it matters because the support of farmers in high  income countries is devastating to the livelihoods of farmers in low  income countries
__label__0 even when their climate and land are well  suited to products like cotton  rice  sugar  or milk  farmers in low  income countries find it difficult to compete
__label__0 us producers obtain a higher price so they sell a larger quantity of sugar
__label__0 the effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the united states can be measured using two concepts developed in demand  supply  and efficiency  consumer surplus and producer surplus
__label__0 us
__label__0 sugar supply and demand when there is free trade  the equilibrium is at point a
__label__0 lost sales translate into lost jobs
__label__0 the hidden opportunity cost of using protectionism to save jobs in one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries
__label__0 this is why the united states international trade commission  in its study of barriers to trade  predicts that reducing trade barriers would not lead to an overall loss of jobs
__label__0 workers in many low  income countries around the world labor under conditions that would be illegal for a worker in the united states
__label__0 workers in countries like china  thailand  brazil  south africa  and poland are often paid less than the united states minimum wage
__label__0 for example  in the united states  the minimum wage is   per hour  a typical wage in many low  income countries might be more like   per day  or often much less
__label__1 dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production
__label__1 anti  dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production
__label__0 since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the world trade organization  wto   nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the wto
__label__0 in general  high  income countries such as the united states  canada  japan  and the nations of the european union have relatively strict environmental standards
__label__0 in contrast  middle and low  income countries like brazil  nigeria  india  and china have lower environmental standards
__label__0 one final reason why economists often treat the national interest argument skeptically is that almost any product can be touted by lobbyists and politicians as vital to national security
__label__0 in   the united states became worried that it was importing half of the wool required for military uniforms  so it declared wool and mohair to be  strategic materials  and began to give subsidies to wool and mohair farmers
__label__1 there are different types of economic integration across the globe  ranging from free trade agreements  in which participants allow each other s imports without tariffs or quotas  to common markets  in which participants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group  to full economic unions  in which  in addition to a common market  monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated
__label__0 many nations belong both to the world trade organization and to regional trading agreements
__label__0 because of technotron s new technology  which in this case is importing goods from another county  other firms in this industry will lose money and lay off workers
__label__0 just as it would have been inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of new scientific technology by trying to shut it down  it would be inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of international trade by trying to restrict trade
__label__1 to a mathematician or an economist  a variable is the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of values
__label__0 in the equation of a line presented above  x and y are the variables  with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis  and b and m representing factors that determine the shape of the line
__label__1 a negative slope means that two variables are negatively related  that is  when x increases  y decreases  or when x decreases  y increases
__label__0 graphically  a negative slope means that  as the line on the line graph moves from left to right  the line falls
__label__0 the data in  link  is displayed in  link  which shows the relationship between two variables  length and median weight for american baby boys and girls during the first three years of life
__label__0 the median means that half of all babies weigh more than this and half weigh less
__label__0 the line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal axis and weight in pounds on the vertical axis
__label__1 a bar graph uses the height of different bars to compare quantities
__label__0 link  lists the  most populous countries in the world
__label__0 for example  points a and b sit on the same indifference curve um  which means that they provide lilly with the same level of utility
__label__0 thus  the marginal utility that lilly would gain from  say  increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from  to so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points a and b
__label__1 indeed  the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the marginal rate of substitution  which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same
__label__0 this information provides the basis for the budget line shown in  link
__label__0 along with the budget line are shown the three indifference curves from  link
__label__0 what is lilly s utility  maximizing choice
__label__0 if oranges get cheaper  people fire up their juicing machines and ease off on other fruits and foods
__label__1 the income effect refers to how a change in the price of a good alters the effective buying power of one s income
__label__0 if the price of a good that you have been buying falls  then in effect your buying power has risen  you are able to purchase more goods
__label__0 as explained in financial markets  the prices of stocks and bonds depend on future events
__label__0 the price of a bond depends on the future payments that the bond is expected to make  including both payments of interest and the repayment of the face value of the bond
__label__0 all sales of the final goods and services that make up gdp will eventually end up as income for workers  for managers  and for investors and owners of firms
__label__1 the sum of all the income received for contributing resources to gdp is called national income  y
__label__0 at some points in the discussion that follows  it will be useful to refer to real gdp as  national income
__label__0 both axes are measured in real  inflation  adjusted  terms
__label__1 the final ingredient of the keynesian cross or expenditure  output diagram is the aggregate expenditure schedule  which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real gdp
__label__0 the intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the degree line  at point e in  link   will show the equilibrium for the economy  because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real gdp
__label__0 exactly how a situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important  because even low  income societies are not literally at zero income  so the point is hypothetical
__label__1 this relationship between income and consumption  illustrated in  link  and  link   is called the consumption function
__label__0 all the components of aggregate demand  consumption  investment  government spending  and the trade balance  are now in place to build the keynesian cross diagram
__label__0 link  builds up an aggregate expenditure function  based on the numerical illustrations of c  i  g  x  and m that have been used throughout this text
__label__1 the meaning of  equilibrium  remains the same  that is  equilibrium is a point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome
__label__0 to understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate expenditure function and the degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium  consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point e  say point h in  link   where output is higher than the equilibrium
__label__0 in this way  the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once
__label__1 this is called the multiplier effect  an initial increase in spending  cycles repeatedly through the economy and has a larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent
__label__0 the equilibrium price is   and the equilibrium quantity is  million
__label__0 to see the benefits to consumers  look at the segment of the demand curve above the equilibrium point and to the left
__label__0 this portion of the demand curve shows that at least some demanders would have been willing to pay more than   for a tablet
__label__1 the amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller s actual cost is called producer surplus
__label__0 in  link   producer surplus is the area labeled g  that is  the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium
__label__1 the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus  also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus
__label__0 in  link   social surplus would be shown as the area f  g
__label__0 social surplus is larger at equilibrium quantity and price than it would be at any other quantity
__label__0 the new consumer surplus is g  and the new producer surplus is h  i
__label__0 during the middle ages  most europeans lived in small villages that consisted of a manorial house or castle for the lord  a church  and simple homes for the peasants or serfs  who made up about  percent of western europe s population
__label__0 hundreds of these castles and walled cities remain all over europe   link
__label__0 one of the most beautifully preserved medieval walled cities is carcassonne  france
__label__0 during this period  the roman church became the most powerful international organization in western europe
__label__0 just as agrarian life depended on the seasons  village and family life revolved around the church
__label__1 the sacraments  or special ceremonies of the church  marked every stage of life  from birth to maturation  marriage  and burial  and brought people into the church on a regular basis
__label__0 as christianity spread throughout europe  it replaced pagan and animistic views  explaining supernatural events and forces of nature in its own terms
__label__1 by the eleventh century  a major christian holy war called the reconquista  or reconquest  had begun to slowly push the muslims from spain
__label__1 this drive was actually an extension of the earlier military conflict between christians and muslims for domination of the holy land  the biblical region of palestine   known as the crusades
__label__1 this drive was actually an extension of the earlier military conflict between christians and muslims for domination of the holy land  the biblical region of palestine   known as the crusades
__label__0 the inca had no system of writing  however
__label__1 they communicated and kept records using a system of colored strings and knots called the quipu   link
__label__0 everywhere in the americas  a crushing demand for labor bedeviled europeans because there were not enough colonists to perform the work necessary to keep the colonies going
__label__1 spain granted encomiendas  legal rights to native labor  to conquistadors who could prove their service to the crown
__label__0 this system reflected the spanish view of colonization  the king rewarded successful conquistadors who expanded the empire
__label__0 the economic philosophy of mercantilism shaped european perceptions of wealth from the s to the late s
__label__1 mercantilism held that only a limited amount of wealth  as measured in gold and silver bullion  existed in the world
__label__1 as europeans traversed the atlantic  they brought with them plants  animals  and diseases that changed lives and landscapes on both sides of the ocean
__label__0 these two  way exchanges between the americas and europe  africa are known collectively as the columbian exchange   link
__label__0 in the s  spain surpassed portugal as the dominant european power
__label__1 this age of exploration and the subsequent creation of an atlantic world marked the earliest phase of globalization  in which previously isolated groups  africans  native americans  and europeans  first came into contact with each other  sometimes with disastrous results
__label__0 spain  with its new world wealth  was the bastion of the catholic faith
__label__1 beginning with the reform efforts of martin luther in  and john calvin in the s  however  catholic dominance came under attack as the protestant reformation  a split or schism among european christians  began
__label__1 however  by the late s  some english members of the church began to agitate for more reform
__label__0 known as puritans  they worked to erase all vestiges of catholicism from the church of england
__label__0 at the time  the term  puritan  was a pejorative one  many people saw puritans as holier  than  thou frauds who used religion to swindle their neighbors
__label__1 by choosing to settle along the rivers on the banks of the chesapeake  the english unknowingly placed themselves at the center of the powhatan empire  a powerful algonquian confederacy of thirty native groups with perhaps as many as twenty  two thousand people
__label__0 the territory of the equally impressive susquehannock people also bordered english settlements at the north end of the chesapeake bay
__label__0 the abundance of european goods gave rise to new artistic objects
__label__1 for example  iron awls made the creation of shell beads among the native people of the eastern woodlands much easier  and the result was an astonishing increase in the production of wampum  shell beads used in ceremonies and as jewelry and currency
__label__0 native peoples had always placed goods in the graves of their departed  and this practice escalated with the arrival of european goods
__label__0 the dutch west india company found the business of colonization in new netherland to be expensive
__label__1 to share some of the costs  it granted dutch merchants who invested heavily in it patroonships  or large tracts of land and the right to govern the tenants there
__label__0 in return  the shareholder who gained the patroonship promised to pay for the passage of at least thirty dutch farmers to populate the colony
__label__1 the glorious revolution also led to the english toleration act of   a law passed by parliament that allowed for greater religious diversity in the empire
__label__1 this act granted religious tolerance to nonconformist trinitarian protestants  those who believed in the holy trinity of god the father  son  and holy ghost   such as baptists  those who advocated adult baptism  and congregationalists  those who followed the puritans  lead in creating independent churches
__label__0 while the church of england remained the official state religious establishment  the toleration act gave much greater religious freedom to nonconformists
__label__1 the freemasons were a fraternal society that advocated enlightenment principles of inquiry and tolerance
__label__0 freemasonry originated in london coffeehouses in the early eighteenth century  and masonic lodges  local units  soon spread throughout europe and the british colonies
__label__1 the monarchy was dissolved  and england became a republic  a state without a king
__label__1 oliver cromwell headed the new english commonwealth  and the period known as the english interregnum  or the time between kings  began
__label__1 creating wealth for the empire remained a primary goal  and in the second half of the seventeenth century  especially during the restoration  england attempted to gain better control of trade with the american colonies
__label__0 the mercantilist policies by which it tried to achieve this control are known as the navigation acts
__label__1 the bostonians paying the excise  man  or tarring and feathering   link    shows five patriots tarring and feathering the commissioner of customs  john malcolm  a sea captain  army officer  and staunch loyalist
__label__1 the print shows the boston tea party  a protest against the tea act of   and the liberty tree  an elm tree near boston common that became a rallying point against the stamp act of
__label__0 prior to the  act  colonial violations of the navigation acts had been tried in local courts  where sympathetic colonial juries refused to convict merchants on trial
__label__0 however  the sugar act required violators to be tried in vice  admiralty courts
__label__1 these crown  sanctioned tribunals  which settled disputes that occurred at sea  operated without juries
__label__0 in   the british parliament moved beyond the efforts during the previous two years to better regulate westward expansion and trade by putting in place the stamp act
__label__1 as a direct tax on the colonists  the stamp act imposed an internal tax on almost every type of printed paper colonists used  including newspapers  legal documents  and playing cards
__label__0 while the architects of the stamp act saw the measure as a way to defray the costs of the british empire  it nonetheless gave rise to the first major colonial protest against british imperial control as expressed in the famous slogan  no taxation without representation   the stamp act reinforced the sense among some colonists that parliament was not treating them as equals of their peers across the atlantic
__label__0 however  pitt was old and ill with gout
__label__0 his chancellor of the exchequer  charles townshend   link    whose job was to manage the empire s finances  took on many of his duties
__label__0 primary among these was raising the needed revenue from the colonies
__label__0 great britain pursued a policy of law and order when dealing with the crises in the colonies in the late s and s
__label__0 relations between the british and many american patriots worsened over the decade  culminating in an unruly mob destroying a fortune in tea by dumping it into boston harbor in december  as a protest against british tax laws
__label__0 the harsh british response to this act in   which included sending british troops to boston and closing boston harbor  caused tensions and resentments to escalate further
__label__0 by the time the british withdrew from boston  fighting had broken out in other colonies as well
__label__1 in may   mecklenburg county in north carolina issued the mecklenburg resolves  stating that a rebellion against great britain had begun  that colonists did not owe any further allegiance to great britain  and that governing authority had now passed to the continental congress
__label__0 the resolves also called upon the formation of militias to be under the control of the continental congress
__label__1 he argued for the creation of an american republic  a state without a king  and extolled the blessings of republicanism  a political philosophy that held that elected representatives  not a hereditary monarch  should govern states
__label__1 the vision of an american republic put forward by paine included the idea of popular sovereignty  citizens in the republic would determine who would represent them  and decide other issues  on the basis of majority rule
__label__0 republicanism also served as a social philosophy guiding the conduct of the patriots in their struggle against the british empire
__label__0 the southern colonies soon became the center of the fighting
__label__0 the southern strategy brought the british success at first  but thanks to the leadership of george washington and general nathanael greene and the crucial assistance of french forces  the continental army defeated the british at yorktown  effectively ending further large  scale operations during the war
__label__1 whereas the british could pay in gold and silver  the american forces relied on paper money  backed by loans obtained in europe
__label__0 this first american money was called continental currency  unfortunately  it quickly fell in value
__label__0 not worth a continental  soon became a shorthand term for something of no value
__label__0 to many revolutionaries  especially wealthy landowners  merchants  and planters  democracy did not offer a good replacement for monarchy
__label__0 indeed  conservative whigs defined themselves in opposition to democracy  which they equated with anarchy
__label__0 in the tenth in a series of essays later known as the federalist papers  virginian james madison wrote   democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention  have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property  and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths
__label__0 many shared this perspective and worked hard to keep democratic tendencies in check
__label__0 while racial thinking permeated the new country  and slavery existed in all the new states  the ideals of the revolution generated a movement toward the abolition of slavery
__label__1 private manumissions  by which slaveholders freed their slaves  provided one pathway from bondage
__label__0 slaveholders in virginia freed some ten thousand slaves
__label__0 pennsylvania s constitution also eliminated the executive branch  there was no governor  and the upper house
__label__1 instead  pennsylvania had a one  house  a unicameral  legislature
__label__1 james madison put forward a proposition known as the virginia plan  which called for a strong national government that could overturn state laws   link
__label__1 the plan featured a bicameral or two  house legislature  with an upper and a lower house
__label__0 the people of the states would elect the members of the lower house  whose numbers would be determined by the population of the state
__label__0 roger sherman from connecticut offered a compromise to break the deadlock over the thorny question of representation
__label__1 his connecticut compromise  also known as the great compromise  outlined a different bicameral legislature in which the upper house  the senate  would have equal representation for all states  each state would be represented by two senators chosen by the state legislatures
__label__0 only the lower house  the house of representatives  would have proportional representation
__label__0 in the fierce debate that erupted  the two sides articulated contrasting visions of the american republic and of democracy
__label__1 supporters of the  constitution  known as federalists  made the case that a centralized republic provided the best solution for the future
__label__1 those who opposed it  known as anti  federalists  argued that the constitution would consolidate all power in a national government  robbing the states of the power to make their own decisions
__label__0 for the national government to be effective  hamilton deemed it essential to have the support of those to whom it owed money  the wealthy  domestic creditor class as well as foreign creditors
__label__1 in january   he delivered his  report on public credit    link    addressing the pressing need of the new republic to become creditworthy
__label__0 he recommended that the new federal government honor all its debts  including all paper money issued by the confederation and the states during the war  at face value
__label__0 the events of  and  challenged the simple interpretation of the french revolution as a happy chapter in the unfolding triumph of republican government over monarchy
__label__1 the french king was executed in january    link    and the next two years became known as the terror  a period of extreme violence against perceived enemies of the revolutionary government
__label__0 revolutionaries advocated direct representative democracy  dismantled catholicism  replaced that religion with a new philosophy known as the cult of the supreme being  renamed the months of the year  and relentlessly employed the guillotine against their enemies
__label__0 one of adams s appointees  william marbury  had been selected to be a justice of the peace in the district of columbia  and when his commission did not arrive  he petitioned the supreme court for an explanation from jefferson s secretary of state  james madison
__label__0 in deciding the case  marbury v madison  in   chief justice john marshall agreed that marbury had the right to a legal remedy  establishing that individuals had rights even the president of the united states could not abridge
__label__0 however  marshall also found that congress s judicial act of   which would have given the supreme court the power to grant marbury remedy  was unconstitutional because the constitution did not allow for cases like marbury s to come directly before the supreme court
__label__0 new orleans and the vast mississippi river valley had been successfully defended  ensuring the future of american settlement and commerce
__label__0 the battle of new orleans immediately catapulted jackson to national prominence as a war hero  and in the s  he emerged as the head of the new democratic party
__label__0 workers were organized the way that they had been in english factories  in family units
__label__1 under the  rhode island system   families were hired
__label__0 the father was placed in charge of the family unit  and he directed the labor of his wife and children
__label__0 in philadelphia  new york  and boston  all cities that experienced dizzying industrial growth during the nineteenth century  workers united to form political parties
__label__1 thomas skidmore  from connecticut  was the outspoken organizer of the working men s party  which lodged a radical protest against the exploitation of workers that accompanied industrialization
__label__0 skidmore took his cue from thomas paine and the american revolution to challenge the growing inequity in the united states
__label__0 even short waterways  such as the two  and  a  half  mile canal going around the rapids of the ohio river near louisville  kentucky  proved a huge leap forward  in this case by opening a water route from pittsburgh to new orleans
__label__1 the preeminent example was the erie canal   link    which linked the hudson river  and thus new york city and the atlantic seaboard  to the great lakes and the mississippi river valley
__label__0 before the s  a code of deference had underwritten the republic s political order
__label__1 deference was the practice of showing respect for individuals who had distinguished themselves through military accomplishments  educational attainment  business success  or family pedigree
__label__1 in this way  van buren helped create a political machine of disciplined party members who prized loyalty above all else  a harbinger of future patronage politics in the united states
__label__0 this system of rewarding party loyalists is known as the spoils system  from the expression   to the victor belong the spoils
__label__0 van buren s political machine helped radically transform new york politics
__label__0 the tariff raised questions about how power should be distributed  causing a fiery debate between those who supported states  rights and those who supported the expanded power of the federal government   link
__label__0 those who championed states  rights denounced the  measure as the tariff of abominations  clear evidence that the federal government favored one region  in this case the north  over another  the south
__label__0 they made their case by pointing out that the north had an expanding manufacturing base while the south did not
__label__0 calhoun fell out of favor with president jackson  who defended peggy eaton and derided those who would not socialize with her  declaring she was  as chaste as a virgin
__label__0 jackson had personal reasons for defending eaton  he drew a parallel between eaton s treatment and that of his late wife  rachel  who had been subjected to attacks on her reputation related to her first marriage  which had ended in divorce
__label__0 martin van buren  who defended the eatons and organized social gatherings with them  became close to jackson  who came to rely on a group of informal advisers that included van buren and was dubbed the kitchen cabinet
__label__0 this select group of presidential supporters highlights the importance of party loyalty to jackson and the democratic party
__label__0 jackson s veto of the bank and his specie circular helped galvanize opposition forces into a new political party  the whigs  a faction that began to form in
__label__0 the name was significant  opponents of jackson saw him as exercising tyrannical power  so they chose the name whig after the eighteenth  century political party that resisted the monarchical power of king george iii
__label__1 in a series of forced marches  some fifteen thousand cherokee were finally relocated to oklahoma
__label__0 this forced migration  known as the trail of tears  caused the deaths of as many as four thousand cherokee   link
__label__0 the creek  choctaw  chickasaw  and seminole peoples were also compelled to go
__label__0 the campaign thrust harrison into the national spotlight
__label__0 democrats tried to discredit him by declaring   give him a barrel of hard  alcoholic  cider and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him  and take my word for it  he will sit the remainder of his days in his log cabin
__label__0 the whigs turned the slur to their advantage by presenting harrison as a man of the people who had been born in a log cabin  in fact  he came from a privileged background in virginia   and the contest became known as the log cabin campaign   link
__label__0 at whig political rallies  the faithful were treated to whiskey made by the e c booz company  leading to the introduction of the word  booze  into the american lexicon
__label__0 the adams  ons treaty upset many american expansionists  who criticized adams for not laying claim to all of texas  which they believed had been included in the louisiana purchase
__label__1 in the summer of   james long  a planter from natchez  mississippi  became a filibuster  or a private  unauthorized military adventurer  when he led three hundred men on an expedition across the sabine river to take control of texas
__label__0 long s men succeeded in capturing nacogdoches  writing a declaration of independence  see below   and setting up a republican government
__label__1 after the  adams  ons treaty defined the us  mexico boundary  the spanish mexican government began actively encouraging americans to settle their northern province
__label__0 texas was sparsely settled  and the few mexican farmers and ranchers who lived there were under constant threat of attack by hostile indian tribes  especially the comanche  who supplemented their hunting with raids in pursuit of horses and cattle
__label__0 to increase the non  indian population in texas and provide a buffer zone between its hostile tribes and the rest of mexico  spain began to recruit empresarios
__label__1 an empresario was someone who brought settlers to the region in exchange for generous grants of land
__label__0 like spain  mexico also wished to encourage settlement in the state of coahuila y texas and passed colonization laws to encourage immigration
__label__1 thousands of americans  primarily from slave states  flocked to texas and quickly came to outnumber the tejanos  the mexican residents of the region
__label__0 the soil and climate offered good opportunities to expand slavery and the cotton kingdom
__label__0 indeed  mexico refused even to acknowledge polk s emissary  john slidell  who had been sent to mexico city to negotiate
__label__0 not to be deterred  polk encouraged thomas o larkin  the us consul in monterey  to assist any american settlers and any californios  the mexican residents of the state  who wished to proclaim their independence from mexico
__label__0 by the end of   having broken diplomatic ties with the united states over texas and having grown alarmed by american actions in california  the mexican government warily anticipated the next move
__label__0 once in california  gathered in camps with names like drunkard s bar  angel s camp  gouge eye  and whiskeytown  the  forty  niners  did not find wealth so easy to come by as they had first imagined
__label__1 although some were able to find gold by panning for it or shoveling soil from river bottoms into sieve  like contraptions called rockers  most did not
__label__0 would they pledge to support it
__label__1 at the party s new york state convention in buffalo  martin van buren s antislavery supporters  called barnburners because they were likened to farmers who were willing to burn down their own barn to get rid of a rat infestation  spoke in favor of the proviso
__label__0 their opponents  known as hunkers  refused to support it
__label__0 the compromise of  brought temporary relief
__label__0 it resolved the issue of slavery in the territories for the moment and prevented secession
__label__0 almost no cotton was grown in the united states in   the year the federal constitution was written
__label__1 however  following the war of   a huge increase in production resulted in the so  called cotton boom  and by midcentury  cotton became the key cash crop  a crop grown to sell rather than for the farmer s sole use  of the southern economy and the most important american commodity
__label__0 by   of the  million slaves in the country s fifteen slave states   million were producing cotton  by   slave labor was producing over two billion pounds of cotton per year
__label__0 white men invested substantial sums in slaves  carefully calculating the annual returns they could expect from a slave as well as the possibility of greater profits through natural increase
__label__0 the domestic slave trade was highly visible  and like the infamous middle passage that brought captive africans to the americas  it constituted an equally disruptive and horrifying journey now called the second middle passage
__label__0 between  and   white american traders sold a million or more slaves in the domestic slave market
__label__0 in   american diplomats met in ostend  belgium  to find a way to gain cuba
__label__1 they wrote a secret memo  known as the ostend manifesto  thought to be penned by james buchanan  who was elected president two years later   stating that if spain refused to sell cuba to the united states  the united states was justified in taking the island as a national security measure
__label__0 the thousands swept up in the movement believed in the possibility of creating a much better world
__label__1 many adopted millennialism  the fervent belief that the kingdom of god would be established on earth and that god would reign on earth for a thousand years  characterized by harmony and christian morality
__label__0 those drawn to the message of the second great awakening yearned for stability  decency  and goodness in the new and turbulent american republic
__label__1 german protestant migrants formed several pietistic societies  communities that stressed transformative individual religious experience or piety over religious rituals and formality
__label__0 one of the earliest of these  the ephrata cloister in pennsylvania  was founded by a charismatic leader named conrad beissel in the s
__label__0 during the late s  smith translated the writing on the golden plates  and in   he published his finding as the book of mormon
__label__1 that same year  he organized the church of christ  the progenitor of the church of jesus christ of latter  day saints popularly known as mormons
__label__0 he presented himself as a prophet and aimed to recapture what he viewed as the purity of the primitive christian church  purity that had been lost over the centuries  smith emphasized the importance of families being led by fathers
__label__0 however  temperance enjoyed a revival in the s  as a new type of reformer took up the cause against alcohol
__label__0 the engine driving the new burst of enthusiastic temperance reform was the washington temperance society  named in deference to george washington   which organized in
__label__0 the leaders of the washingtonians came not from the ranks of protestant ministers but from the working class
__label__1 an early and popular  reform  to slavery was colonization  or a movement advocating the displacement of african americans out of the country  usually to africa
__label__0 in   the society for the colonization of free people of color of america  also called the american colonization society or acs  was founded with this goal
__label__1 garrison also preached immediatism  the moral demand to take immediate action to end slavery
__label__0 he wrote of equal rights and demanded that blacks be treated as equal to whites
__label__1 the operation of the law further alarmed northerners and confirmed for many the existence of a  slave power   that is  a minority of elite slaveholders who wielded a disproportionate amount of power over the federal government  shaping domestic and foreign policies to suit their interests
__label__0 despite southerners  repeated insistence on states  rights  the fugitive slave act showed that slaveholders were willing to use the power of the federal government to bend people in other states to their will
__label__0 the democrats divided along sectional lines as a result of the bill  and the whig party  in decline in the early s  found its political power slipping further
__label__0 most important  the kansas  nebraska act gave rise to the republican party  a new political party that attracted northern whigs  democrats who shunned the kansas  nebraska act  members of the free  soil party  and assorted abolitionists
__label__0 indeed  with the formation of the republican party  the free  soil party ceased to exist
__label__0 the electoral contest in  took place in a transformed political landscape
__label__0 a third political party appeared  the anti  immigrant american party  a formerly secretive organization with the nickname  the know  nothing party  because its members denied knowing anything about it
__label__0 by   the american or know  nothing party had evolved into a national force committed to halting further immigration
__label__0 douglas responded to lincoln during the second debate at freeport  illinois
__label__1 in what became known as the freeport doctrine  douglas adamantly upheld popular sovereignty  declaring   it matters not what way the supreme court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a territory under the constitution  the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please   the freeport doctrine antagonized southerners and caused a major rift in the democratic party
__label__0 the doctrine did help douglas in illinois  however  where most voters opposed the further expansion of slavery
__label__0 despite the ruptures and tensions  by the s  some hope of healing the nation still existed
__label__0 before lincoln took office  john crittenden  a senator from kentucky who had helped form the constitutional union party during the  presidential election  attempted to defuse the explosive situation by offering six constitutional amendments and a series of resolutions  known as the crittenden compromise
__label__0 crittenden s goal was to keep the south from seceding  and his strategy was to transform the constitution to explicitly protect slavery forever
__label__0 meanwhile  lincoln and military leaders in the north hoped a quick blow to the south  especially if they could capture the confederacy s new capital of richmond  virginia  would end the rebellion before it went any further
__label__0 on july     the two armies met near manassas  virginia  along bull run creek  only thirty miles from washington  dc
__label__0 so great was the belief that this would be a climactic union victory that many washington socialites and politicians brought picnic lunches to a nearby area  hoping to witness history unfolding before them
__label__0 the union army s inability to destroy lee s army at antietam made it clear to lincoln that mcclellan would never win the war  and the president was forced to seek a replacement
__label__0 lincoln wanted someone who could deliver a decisive union victory
__label__0 over the objections of slaveholders  it impressed slaves  seizing these workers from their owners and forcing them to work on fortifications and rail lines
__label__1 concerned about the resistance to and unhappiness with the government measures  in   the confederate congress gave president davis the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus  the right of those arrested to be brought before a judge or court to determine whether there is cause to hold the prisoner
__label__0 with a stated goal of bolstering national security in the fledgling republic  this change meant that the confederacy could arrest and detain indefinitely any suspected enemy without giving a reason
__label__1 since the beginning of the war  thousands of slaves had fled to the safety of union lines
__label__0 in may   union general benjamin butler and others labeled these refugees from slavery contrabands
__label__0 butler reasoned that since southern states had left the united states  he was not obliged to follow federal fugitive slave laws
__label__0 in keeping with the logic of total war  sherman s forces cut a swath of destruction to savannah
__label__1 on sherman s march to the sea  the union army  seeking to demoralize the south  destroyed everything in its path  despite strict instructions regarding the preservation of civilian property
__label__0 although towns were left standing  houses and barns were burned
__label__1 the end of the civil war saw the beginning of the reconstruction era  when former rebel southern states were integrated back into the union
__label__0 president lincoln moved quickly to achieve the war s ultimate goal  reunification of the country
__label__0 in february   two of the radical republicans  ohio senator benjamin wade and maryland representative henry winter davis  answered lincoln with a proposal of their own
__label__1 among other stipulations  the wade  davis bill called for a majority of voters and government officials in confederate states to take an oath  called the ironclad oath  swearing that they had never supported the confederacy or made war against the united states
__label__0 those who could not or would not take the oath would be unable to take part in the future political life of the south
__label__0 in this endeavor  the freedmen s bureau received support from christian organizations that had long advocated for abolition  such as the american missionary association  ama
__label__1 the ama used the knowledge and skill it had acquired while working in missions in africa and with american indian groups to establish and run schools for freed slaves in the postwar south
__label__0 the  military reconstruction act  which encompassed the vision of radical republicans  set a new direction for reconstruction in the south
__label__0 republicans saw this law  and three supplementary laws passed by congress that year  called the reconstruction acts  as a way to deal with the disorder in the south
__label__0 the  act divided the ten southern states that had yet to ratify the fourteenth amendment into five military districts  tennessee had already been readmitted to the union by this time and so was excluded from these acts
__label__0 while they no longer faced relentless toil under the lash  freed people emerged from slavery without any money and needed farm implements  food  and other basic necessities to start their new lives
__label__1 under the crop  lien system  store owners extended credit to farmers under the agreement that the debtors would pay with a portion of their future harvest
__label__0 however  the creditors charged high interest rates  making it even harder for freed people to gain economic independence
__label__1 despite the great variety in klan membership  on the whole  the group tended to direct its attention toward persecuting freed people and people they considered carpetbaggers  a term of abuse applied to northerners accused of having come to the south to acquire wealth through political power at the expense of southerners
__label__1 the colorful term captured the disdain of southerners for these people  reflecting the common assumption that these men  sensing great opportunity  packed up all their worldly possessions in carpetbags  a then  popular type of luggage  and made their way to the south
__label__0 many white southerners felt humiliated by the process of radical reconstruction and the way republicans had upended southern society  placing blacks in positions of authority while taxing large landowners to pay for the education of former slaves
__label__1 those committed to rolling back the tide of radical reconstruction in the south called themselves redeemers  a label that expressed their desire to redeem their states from northern control and to restore the antebellum social order whereby blacks were kept safely under the boot heel of whites
__label__0 they represented the democratic party in the south and worked tirelessly to end what they saw as an era of  negro misrule
__label__0 by   they had succeeded in bringing about the  redemption  of the south  effectively destroying the dream of radical reconstruction
__label__1 the homestead act allowed any head of household  or individual over the age of twenty  one  including unmarried women  to receive a parcel of  acres for only a nominal filing fee
__label__0 all that recipients were required to do in exchange was to  improve the land  within a period of five years of taking possession
__label__0 similar advancements in hay mowers  manure spreaders  and threshing machines greatly improved farm production for those who could afford them
__label__1 where capital expense became a significant factor  larger commercial farms  known as  bonanza farmsbegan to develop
__label__0 farmers in minnesota  north dakota  and south dakota hired migrant farmers to grow wheat on farms in excess of twenty thousand acres each
__label__0 one example of the violence that bubbled up was the infamous fence cutting war in clay county  texas
__label__0 there  cowboys began destroying fences that several ranchers erected along public lands  land they had no right to enclose
__label__0 a more effective means with which to address the public perception of the  indian threat  was needed
__label__0 americanization provided the answer
__label__0 although thomas alva edison   link   is best known for his contributions to the electrical industry  his experimentation went far beyond the light bulb
__label__0 edison was quite possibly the greatest inventor of the turn of the century  saying famously that he  hoped to have a minor invention every ten days and a big thing every month or so
__label__0 he registered  patents over his lifetime and ran a world  famous laboratory  menlo park  which housed a rotating group of up to twenty  five scientists from around the globe
__label__0 rockefeller was ruthless in his pursuit of total control of the oil refining business
__label__0 as other entrepreneurs flooded the area seeking a quick fortune  rockefeller developed a plan to crush his competitors and create a true monopoly in the refining industry
__label__0 beginning in   he forged agreements with several large railroad companies to obtain discounted freight rates for shipping his product
__label__0 in order to control the variety of interests he now maintained in industry  rockefeller created a new legal entity  known as a trust
__label__1 in this arrangement  a small group of trustees possess legal ownership of a business that they operate for the benefit of other investors
__label__1 in the s  irish coal miners in eastern pennsylvania formed a secret organization known as the molly maguires  named for the famous irish patriot
__label__0 through a series of scare tactics that included kidnappings  beatings  and even murder  the molly maguires sought to bring attention to the miners  plight  as well as to cause enough damage and concern to the mine owners that the owners would pay attention to their concerns
__label__0 churches and civic organizations provided some relief to the challenges of working  class city life
__label__0 churches were moved to intervene through their belief in the concept of the social gospel
__label__1 this philosophy stated that all christians  whether they were church leaders or social reformers  should be as concerned about the conditions of life in the secular world as the afterlife  and the reverend washington gladden was a major advocate
__label__0 one example of a machine political system was the democratic political machine tammany hall in new york  run by machine boss william tweed with assistance from george washington plunkitt   link
__label__0 there  citizens knew their immediate problems would be addressed in return for their promise of political support in future elections
__label__0 while the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of funds to find anyplace better  and the wealthy class chose to remain in the cities to stay close to the action of big business transactions  the emerging middle class responded to urban challenges with their own solutions
__label__0 this group included the managers  salesmen  engineers  doctors  accountants  and other salaried professionals who still worked for a living  but were significantly better educated and compensated than the working  class poor
__label__1 political philosopher herbert spencer took darwin s theory of evolution further  coining the actual phrase  survival of the fittest   and later helping to popularize the phrase social darwinism to posit that society evolved much like a natural organism  wherein some individuals will succeed due to racially and ethnically inherent traits  and their ability to adapt
__label__0 a person s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual
__label__1 phenotype  on the other hand  refers to the individual s inherited physical characteristics  which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences   link
__label__1 a  genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material  dna  inherited from one s parents
__label__1 a  genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material  dna  inherited from one s parents
__label__0 b  phenotype describes an individual s observable characteristics  such as hair color  skin color  height  and build
__label__1 in this example  we will call the gene for cleft chin  b   and the gene for smooth chin  b  cleft chin is a dominant trait  which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent  bb  or both parents  bb  will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele
__label__1 when someone has two copies of the same allele  they are said to be homozygous for that allele
__label__1 when someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene  they are said to be heterozygous
__label__1 a  a punnett square is a tool used to predict how genes will interact in the production of offspring
__label__0 the capital b represents the dominant allele  and the lowercase b represents the recessive allele
__label__1 most traits are polygenic  controlled by more than one gene
__label__0 height is one example of a polygenic trait  as are skin color and weight  in this punnett square  n represents the normal allele  and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with pku
__label__0 if two individuals mate who are both heterozygous for the allele associated with pku  their offspring have a   chance of expressing the pku phenotype

__label__1 neurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system   billion strong at birth
__label__0 like all cells  neurons consist of several different parts  each serving a specialized function   link
__label__1 the nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma  or cell body
__label__0 the soma has branching extensions known as dendrites
__label__1 the neuron is a small information processor  and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons
__label__0 axons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet
__label__1 in some axons  glial cells form a fatty substance known as the myelin sheath  which coats the axon and acts as an insulator  increasing the speed at which the signal travels
__label__0 the myelin sheath is crucial for the normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system  the loss of the insulation it provides can be detrimental to normal function
__label__0 we begin at the neuronal membrane
__label__1 the neuron exists in a fluid environment  it is surrounded by extracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid  ie  cytoplasm
__label__0 the neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate  a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra and extracellular fluids being electrically different
__label__0 the action potential is an all  or  none phenomenon
__label__1 in simple terms  this means that an incoming signal from another neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation
__label__0 there are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons  and we can speak in broad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters   link
__label__0 much of what psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in psychological disorders
__label__1 psychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system
__label__1 agonists are chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site and  thus  strengthen its effects
__label__1 an antagonist  on the other hand  blocks or impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor
__label__1 the somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary
__label__0 it is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the cns  therefore  it consists of motor neurons and sensory neurons
__label__0 the two systems have complementary functions  operating in tandem to maintain the body s homeostasis
__label__1 homeostasis is a state of equilibrium  in which biological conditions  such as body temperature  are maintained at optimal levels
__label__1 the spinal cordit can be said that the spinal cord is what connects the brain to the outside world
__label__0 because of it  the brain can act
__label__1 there is evidence of some specialization of function  referred to as lateralization  in each hemisphere  mainly regarding differences in language ability
__label__0 beyond that  however  the differences that have been found have been minor
__label__1 lobes of the brainthe four lobes of the brain are the frontal  parietal  temporal  and occipital lobes   link
__label__1 the frontal lobe is located in the forward part of the brain  extending back to a fissure known as the central sulcus
__label__0 the frontal lobe is involved in reasoning  motor control  emotion  and language
__label__1 gage s case occurred in the midst of a th century debate over localization  regarding whether certain areas of the brain are associated with particular functions
__label__0 on the basis of extremely limited information about gage  the extent of his injury  and his life before and after the accident  scientists tended to find support for their own views  on whichever side of the debate they fell  macmillan
__label__0 a  phineas gage holds the iron rod that penetrated his skull in an  railroad construction accident
__label__0 b  gage s prefrontal cortex was severely damaged in the left hemisphere
__label__1 the temporal lobe is located on the side of the head  temporal means  near the temples    and is associated with hearing  memory  emotion  and some aspects of language
__label__1 the temporal lobe is located on the side of the head  temporal means  near the temples    and is associated with hearing  memory  emotion  and some aspects of language
__label__1 the auditory cortex  the main area responsible for processing auditory information  is located within the temporal lobe
__label__1 the occipital lobe is located at the very back of the brain  and contains the primary visual cortex  which is responsible for interpreting incoming visual information
__label__1 the occipital lobe is located at the very back of the brain  and contains the primary visual cortex  which is responsible for interpreting incoming visual information
__label__1 the occipital cortex is organized retinotopically  which means there is a close relationship between the position of an object in a person s visual field and the position of that object s representation on the cortex
__label__1 the occipital cortex is organized retinotopically  which means there is a close relationship between the position of an object in a person s visual field and the position of that object s representation on the cortex
__label__1 the limbic system is involved in processing both emotion and memory
__label__0 interestingly  the sense of smell projects directly to the limbic system  therefore  not surprisingly  smell can evoke emotional responses in ways that other sensory modalities can not
__label__1 the amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories
__label__1 the hypothalamus regulates a number of homeostatic processes  including the regulation of body temperature  appetite  and blood pressure
__label__0 the hypothalamus also serves as an interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system and in the regulation of sexual motivation and behavior
__label__0 midbrain and hindbrain structures
__label__1 the midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain  between the forebrain and the hindbrain
__label__1 the reticular formation is centered in the midbrain  but it actually extends up into the forebrain and down into the hindbrain
__label__0 the reticular formation is important in regulating the sleep  wake cycle  arousal  alertness  and motor activity
__label__0 it contains the medulla  pons  and cerebellum   link
__label__1 the medulla controls the automatic processes of the autonomic nervous system  such as breathing  blood pressure  and heart rate
__label__1 the word pons literally means  bridge   and as the name suggests  the pons serves to connect the brain and spinal cord
__label__0 on february     a florida woman named terri schiavo went into cardiac arrest  apparently triggered by a bulimic episode
__label__0 she was eventually revived  but her brain had been deprived of oxygen for a long time
__label__1 positron emission tomography  pet  scans create pictures of the living  active brain   link
__label__1 an individual receiving a pet scan drinks or is injected with a mildly radioactive substance  called a tracer
__label__0 in some situations  it is helpful to gain an understanding of the overall activity of a person s brain  without needing information on the actual location of the activity
__label__1 electroencephalography  eeg  serves this purpose by providing a measure of a brain s electrical activity
__label__0 an array of electrodes is placed around a person s head   link
__label__1 located in the neck  the thyroid gland releases hormones that regulate growth  metabolism  and appetite
__label__1 in hyperthyroidism  or grave s disease  the thyroid secretes too much of the hormone thyroxine  causing agitation  bulging eyes  and weight loss
__label__0 these pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels  insulin  or raising them  glucagon
__label__1 people who suffer from diabetes do not produce enough insulin  therefore  they must take medications that stimulate or replace insulin production  and they must closely control the amount of sugars and carbohydrates they consume  the gonads secrete sexual hormones  which are important in reproduction  and mediate both sexual motivation and behavior
__label__1 the female gonads are the ovaries  the male gonads are the testes
__label__0 visit this website to see an example of a consent form  while the informed consent form should be as honest as possible in describing exactly what participants will be doing  sometimes deception is necessary to prevent participants  knowledge of the exact research question from affecting the results of the study
__label__1 deception involves purposely misleading experiment participants in order to maintain the integrity of the experiment  but not to the point where the deception could be considered harmful
__label__0 for example  if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire  we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants  responses
__label__0 many psychologists conduct research involving animal subjects
__label__0 often  these researchers use rodents   link   or birds as the subjects of their experiments  the apa estimates that   of all animal research in psychology uses these species  american psychological association  n d
__label__1 because many basic processes in animals are sufficiently similar to those in humans  these animals are acceptable substitutes for research that would be considered unethical in human participants
__label__0 we can measure correlation by calculating a statistic known as a correlation coefficient
__label__1 a correlation coefficient is a number from  to  that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between variables
__label__0 the correlation coefficient is usually represented by the letter r
__label__1 correlational research is useful because it allows us to discover the strength and direction of relationships that exist between two variables
__label__1 however  correlation is limited because establishing the existence of a relationship tells us little about cause and effect
__label__0 while variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other  it could also be that some other factor  a confounding variable  is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest
__label__0 we also tend to make the mistake of illusory correlations  especially with unsystematic observations
__label__1 illusory correlations  or false correlations  occur when people believe that relationships exist between two things when no such relationship exists
__label__0 one well  known illusory correlation is the supposed effect that the moon s phases have on human behavior
__label__0 in order to conduct an experiment  a researcher must have a specific hypothesis to be tested
__label__1 as you ve learned  hypotheses can be formulated either through direct observation of the real world or after careful review of previous research
__label__0 ideally  the people who observe and record the children s behavior are unaware of who was assigned to the experimental or control group  in order to control for experimenter bias
__label__1 experimenter bias refers to the possibility that a researcher s expectations might skew the results of the study
__label__0 remember  conducting an experiment requires a lot of planning  and the people involved in the research project have a vested interest in supporting their hypotheses
__label__0 because by doing so  we can control for both experimenter and participant expectations
__label__0 if you are familiar with the phrase placebo effect  you already have some idea as to why this is an important consideration
__label__1 the placebo effect occurs when people s expectations or beliefs influence or determine their experience in a given situation
__label__0 our study involves human participants so we need to determine who to include
__label__1 participants are the subjects of psychological research  and as the name implies  individuals who are involved in psychological research actively participate in the process
__label__0 often  psychological research projects rely on college students to serve as participants
__label__0 random assignment is critical for sound experimental design
__label__1 with sufficiently large samples  random assignment makes it unlikely that there are systematic differences between the groups
__label__0 poorly conceived or executed studies can be weeded out  and even well  designed research can be improved by the revisions suggested
__label__1 peer review also ensures that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to replicate it  meaning they can repeat the experiment using different samples to determine reliability
__label__0 sometimes replications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding
__label__1 in observational research  scientists are conducting a clinical or case study when they focus on one person or just a few individuals
__label__0 indeed  some scientists spend their entire careers studying just    individuals
__label__0 the information provided by these studies is invaluable in understanding how those animals organize socially and communicate with one another
__label__0 the anthropologist jane goodall  for example  spent nearly five decades observing the behavior of chimpanzees in africa   link
__label__0 as an illustration of the types of concerns that a researcher might encounter in naturalistic observation  some scientists criticized goodall for giving the chimps names instead of referring to them by numbers  using names was thought to undermine the emotional detachment required for the objectivity of the study  mckie
__label__0 to protect against this type of bias  researchers should have clear criteria established for the types of behaviors recorded and how those behaviors should be classified
__label__1 in addition  researchers often compare observations of the same event by multiple observers  in order to test inter  rater reliability  a measure of reliability that assesses the consistency of observations by different observers
__label__0 instead  they use existing records to answer various research questions
__label__0 this type of research approach is known as archival research
__label__1 archival research relies on looking at past records or data sets to look for interesting patterns or relationships
__label__0 even without significant life changes  some people may simply choose to discontinue their participation in the project
__label__1 as a result  the attrition rates  or reduction in the number of research participants due to dropouts  in longitudinal studies are quite high and increases over the course of a project
__label__0 for this reason  researchers using this approach typically recruit many participants fully expecting that a substantial number will drop out before the end
__label__0 in the end  research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions
__label__1 facts are observable realities  and opinions are personal judgments  conclusions  or attitudes that may or may not be accurate
__label__0 in the scientific community  facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research  the process of scientific research
__label__0 scientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method
__label__0 we ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas  but what sort of ideas are they  exactly
__label__1 a theory is a well  developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena
__label__0 theories are repeatedly checked against the world  but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once  instead  researchers create hypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory
__label__1 a scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable  or capable of being shown to be incorrect
__label__0 recall from the introductory chapter that sigmund freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors   link
__label__0 however  a major criticism of freud s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable  for example  it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the i d  the ego  and the superego  the three elements of personality described in freud s theories
__label__0 the scientific method is also a form of empiricism
__label__1 an empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation  including experimentation  rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities
__label__0 in some areas in psychology  it is common for individuals who have recently earned their phd to seek out positions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty
__label__0 in most cases  young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full  time faculty position
__label__1 as the name suggests  biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior
__label__0 while biological psychology is a broad field  many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function of the nervous system is related to behavior   link
__label__1 as mentioned in the previous section  the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior
__label__1 thus  cognitive psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions  or thoughts  and their relationship to our experiences and our actions
__label__0 like biological psychology  cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds
__label__1 personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique
__label__0 several individuals  eg  freud and maslow  that we have already discussed in our historical overview of psychology  and the american psychologist gordon allport  contributed to early theories of personality
__label__1 social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others
__label__1 social psychologists conduct research on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain the behaviors of others  prejudice  and attraction  and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts
__label__1 health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological  psychological  and sociocultural factors
__label__0 this particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model   link
__label__1 clinical psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic patterns of behavior
__label__0 as such  it is generally considered to be a more applied area within psychology  however  some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research
__label__1 forensic psychology is a branch of psychology that deals questions of psychology as they arise in the context of the justice system
__label__0 for example  forensic psychologists  and forensic psychiatrists  will assess a person s competency to stand trial  assess the state of mind of a defendant  act as consultants on child custody cases  consult on sentencing and treatment recommendations  and advise on issues such as eyewitness testimony and children s testimony  american board of forensic psychology
__label__0 these experimental requirements were put in place to eliminate  interpretation  in the reporting of internal experiences and to counter the argument that there is no way to know that an individual is observing their mind or consciousness accurately  since it can not be seen by any other person
__label__1 this attempt to understand the structure or characteristics of the mind was known as structuralism
__label__0 wundt established his psychology laboratory at the university at leipzig in    link
__label__0 perhaps one of the most influential and well  known figures in psychology s history was sigmund freud   link
__label__0 freud      was an austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from  hysteria  and neurosis
__label__0 early work in the field of behavior was conducted by the russian physiologist ivan pavlov
__label__1 pavlov studied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex  in which an animal or human produced a reflex  unconscious  response to a stimulus and  over time  was conditioned to produce the response to a different stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus
__label__0 behaviorism has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior
__label__0 b f skinner      was an american psychologist   link
__label__0 like watson  skinner was a behaviorist  and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences
__label__0 abraham maslow      was an american psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of human needs in motivating behavior   link
__label__0 although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter  a brief overview will be provided here
__label__1 consciousness describes our awareness of internal and external stimuli
__label__0 awareness of internal stimuli includes feeling pain  hunger  thirst  sleepiness  and being aware of our thoughts and emotions
__label__1 biological rhythms are internal rhythms of biological activity
__label__0 a woman s menstrual cycle is an example of a biological rhythm  a recurring  cyclical pattern of bodily changes
__label__1 in the brain  the hypothalamus  which lies above the pituitary gland  is a main center of homeostasis
__label__1 homeostasis is the tendency to maintain a balance  or optimal level  within a biological system
__label__1 one important regulator of sleep  wake cycles is the hormone melatonin
__label__1 the pineal gland  an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases melatonin  is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system during sleep  hardeland  pandi  perumal   cardinali
__label__1 melatonin release is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light
__label__1 jet lag is a collection of symptoms that results from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment
__label__0 these symptoms include fatigue  sluggishness  irritability  and insomnia  ie  a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week over a month s time   roth
__label__0 as we grow older  we sleep less
__label__1 in fact  a meta  analysis  which is a study that combines the results of many related studies  conducted within the last decade indicates that by the time we are  years old  we average fewer than  hours of sleep per day  ohayon  carskadon  guilleminault   vitiello
__label__0 as the amount of time we sleep varies over our lifespan  presumably the sleep debt would adjust accordingly
__label__1 sleep can be divided into two different general phases  rem sleep and non  rem  nrem  sleep
__label__1 rapid eye movement  rem  sleep is characterized by darting movements of the eyes under closed eyelids
__label__0 brain waves during rem sleep appear very similar to brain waves during wakefulness
__label__0 in terms of brain wave activity  stage  sleep is associated with both alpha and theta waves
__label__1 the early portion of stage  sleep produces alpha waves  which are relatively low frequency     hz   high amplitude patterns of electrical activity  waves  that become synchronized   link
__label__1 the early portion of stage  sleep produces alpha waves  which are relatively low frequency     hz   high amplitude patterns of electrical activity  waves  that become synchronized   link
__label__0 this pattern of brain wave activity resembles that of someone who is very relaxed  yet awake
__label__1 theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain  but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles   link
__label__1 a sleep spindle is a rapid burst of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory  fogel  smith    poe  walsh   bjorness
__label__0 in addition  the appearance of k  complexes is often associated with stage  sleep
__label__0 the meaning of dreams varies across different cultures and periods of time
__label__0 by the late th century  german psychiatrist sigmund freud had become convinced that dreams represented an opportunity to gain access to the unconscious
__label__0 by analyzing dreams  freud thought people could increase self  awareness and gain valuable insight to help them deal with the problems they faced in their lives
__label__0 the th century swiss psychiatrist carl jung believed that dreams allowed us to tap into the collective unconscious
__label__1 the collective unconscious  as described by jung  is a theoretical repository of information he believed to be shared by everyone
__label__0 according to jung  certain symbols in dreams reflected universal archetypes with meanings that are similar for all people regardless of culture or location
__label__1 a parasomnia is one of a group of sleep disorders in which unwanted  disruptive motor activity andor experiences during sleep play a role
__label__0 parasomnias can occur in either rem or nrem phases of sleep
__label__1 a person with restless leg syndrome has uncomfortable sensations in the legs during periods of inactivity or when trying to fall asleep
__label__0 this discomfort is relieved by deliberately moving the legs  which  not surprisingly  contributes to difficulty in falling or staying asleep
__label__0 there are two types of sleep apnea  obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea
__label__1 obstructive sleep apnea occurs when an individual s airway becomes blocked during sleep  and air is prevented from entering the lungs
__label__1 in central sleep apnea  disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing  white
__label__0 one of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep
__label__0 sids
__label__1 in sudden infant death syndrome  sids  an infant stops breathing during sleep and dies
__label__0 infants younger than  months appear to be at the highest risk for sids  and boys have a greater risk than girls
__label__1 the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders  fifth edition  dsm  is used by clinicians to diagnose individuals suffering from various psychological disorders
__label__0 drug use disorders are addictive disorders  and the criteria for specific substance  drug  use disorders are described in dsm
__label__1 in contrast  a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional  rather than physical  need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress
__label__1 tolerance is linked to physiological dependence  and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower doses
__label__0 tolerance can cause the user to increase the amount of drug used to a dangerous level  even to the point of overdose and death
__label__1 stimulants are drugs that tend to increase overall levels of neural activity
__label__0 many of these drugs act as agonists of the dopamine neurotransmitter system
__label__0 while caffeine is generally considered a relatively safe drug  high blood levels of caffeine can result in insomnia  agitation  muscle twitching  nausea  irregular heartbeat  and even death  reissig  strain   griffiths    wolt  ganetsky   babu
__label__0 in   kromann and nielson reported on a case study of a year  old woman who suffered significant ill effects from her use of caffeine
__label__0 thus  opioid drugs  which mimic this endogenous painkilling mechanism  have an extremely high potential for abuse
__label__1 natural opioids  called opiates  are derivatives of opium  which is a naturally occurring compound found in the poppy plant
__label__1 natural opioids  called opiates  are derivatives of opium  which is a naturally occurring compound found in the poppy plant
__label__1 there are now several synthetic versions of opiate drugs  correctly called opioids  that have very potent painkilling effects  and they are often abused
__label__1 codeine is an opioid with relatively low potency
__label__0 it is often prescribed for minor pain  and it is available over  the  counter in some other countries
__label__1 meditation is the act of focusing on a single target  such as the breath or a repeated sound  to increase awareness of the moment
__label__1 while hypnosis is generally achieved through the interaction of a therapist and the person being treated  an individual can perform meditation alone
__label__0 the sensitivity of a given sensory system to the relevant stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold
__label__1 absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to be detected   of the time
__label__0 another way to think about this is by asking how dim can a light be or how soft can a sound be and still be detected half of the time
__label__0 while our sensory receptors are constantly collecting information from the environment  it is ultimately how we interpret that information that affects how we interact with the world
__label__1 perception refers to the way sensory information is organized  interpreted  and consciously experienced
__label__0 perception involves both bottom  up and top  down processing
__label__1 in fact  we often do nt perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of time
__label__0 this is known as sensory adaptation
__label__0 imagine entering a classroom with an old analog clock
__label__0 the shared experiences of people within a given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception
__label__0 for example  marshall segall  donald campbell  and melville herskovits    published the results of a multinational study in which they demonstrated that individuals from western cultures were more prone to experience certain types of visual illusions than individuals from non  western cultures  and vice versa
__label__0 one such illusion that westerners were more likely to experience was the mller  lyer illusion   link
__label__1 the lines appear to be different lengths  but they are actually the same length
__label__1 the amplitude of a wave is the height of a wave as measured from the highest point on the wave  peak or crest  to the lowest point on the wave  trough
__label__1 wavelength refers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next
__label__0 like light waves  the physical properties of sound waves are associated with various aspects of our perception of sound
__label__1 the frequency of a sound wave is associated with our perception of that sound s pitch
__label__1 high  frequency sound waves are perceived as high  pitched sounds  while low  frequency sound waves are perceived as low  pitched sounds
__label__1 the eye is the major sensory organ involved in vision   link
__label__1 light waves are transmitted across the cornea and enter the eye through the pupil
__label__1 when light levels are high  the pupil will constrict  or become smaller  to reduce the amount of light that enters the eye
__label__0 the pupil s size is controlled by muscles that are connected to the iris  which is the colored portion of the eye
__label__1 the fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells   link
__label__1 these photoreceptor cells  known as cones  are light  detecting cells
__label__0 the cones are specialized types of photoreceptors that work best in bright light conditions
__label__0 rods and cones are connected  via several interneurons  to retinal ganglion cells
__label__1 axons from the retinal ganglion cells converge and exit through the back of the eye to form the optic nerve
__label__1 the optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain
__label__0 normal  sighted individuals have three different types of cones that mediate color vision
__label__0 each of these cone types is maximally sensitive to a slightly different wavelength of light
__label__0 another implication is that this leads to the experience of negative afterimages
__label__1 an afterimage describes the continuation of a visual sensation after removal of the stimulus
__label__1 in many cases  a business that focuses on one or a few products  sometimes called its  core competency   is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products
__label__0 third  specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale  which means that for many goods  as the level of production increases  the average cost of producing each individual unit declines
__label__0 for example  if a factory produces only  cars per year  each car will be quite expensive to make on average
__label__0 for the united states  this is the federal reserve
__label__1 fiscal policy  which involves government spending and taxes  is determined by a nation s legislative body
__label__0 for the united states  this is the congress and the executive branch  which originates the federal budget
__label__0 sometimes economists use the term model instead of theory
__label__0 strictly speaking  a theory is a more abstract representation  while a model is more applied or empirical representation
__label__0 there are at least three ways societies have found to organize an economy
__label__0 the first is the traditional economy  which is the oldest economic system and can be found in parts of asia  africa  and south america
__label__1 traditional economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done  ie  tradition
__label__0 the new york stock exchange  shown in  link   is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together
__label__0 in a market economy  decision  making is decentralized
__label__1 market economies are based on private enterprise  the means of production  resources and businesses  are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals
__label__1 the rise of globalizationrecent decades have seen a trend toward globalization  which is the expanding cultural  political  and economic connections between people around the world
__label__0 one measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods  services  and assets across national borders  in other words  international trade and financial capital flows
__label__1 imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically
__label__1 the size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product  gdp
__label__0 thus  the ratio of exports divided by gdp measures what share of a country s total economic production is sold in other countries
__label__0 in many cases  it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price
__label__0 if your cousin buys a new bicycle for    then   measures the amount of  other consumption  that he has given up
__label__1 the general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring a higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units is a common pattern
__label__0 economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility  which means that as a person receives more of a good  the additional  or marginal  utility from each additional unit of the good declines
__label__0 in other words  the first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth
__label__0 the law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all  or  nothing choices
__label__0 the opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to give up
__label__0 just as with alphonso s budget constraint  the opportunity cost is shown by the slope of the production possibilities frontier
__label__0 by now you might be saying   hey  this ppf is sounding like the budget constraint
__label__0 if so  read the following clear it up feature
__label__0 in everyday usage  efficiency refers to lack of waste
__label__1 an inefficient machine operates at high cost  while an efficient machine operates at lower cost  because it is not wasting energy or materials
__label__1 an inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs  while an efficient organization meets schedules  is focused  and performs within budget
__label__0 for government  this process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm
__label__0 at the individual and firm level  the market economy coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity  quality  and price that people want
__label__0 but for both the government and the market economy in the short term  increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy
__label__0 fortunately however  the assumption that individuals are purely self  interested is a simplification about human nature
__label__0 in fact  we need to look no further than to adam smith  the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this
__label__0 the opening sentence of his book  the theory of moral sentiments  puts it very clearly   how selfish soever man may be supposed  there are evidently some principles in his nature  which interest him in the fortune of others  and render their happiness necessary to him  though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it
__label__0 clearly  individuals are both self  interested and altruistic
__label__1 the third theme is economic efficiency  or getting the most benefit from scarce resources
__label__0 all choices on the production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases  there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other
__label__0 to find answers to these questions  we need to understand the concept of elasticity
__label__1 elasticity is an economics concept that measures responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable
__label__0 suppose you drop two items from a second  floor balcony
__label__1 the price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price
__label__1 the price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price  elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories  elastic  inelastic  and unitary
__label__1 an elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one  indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price
__label__0 elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply
__label__1 unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply  as summarized in  link
__label__1 infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded  qd  or supplied  qs  changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all
__label__0 in both cases  the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in  link
__label__1 constant unitary elasticity  in either a supply or demand curve  occurs when a price change of one percent results in a quantity change of one percent
__label__0 link  shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity
__label__0 income elasticity of demand
__label__1 the income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income
__label__0 income elasticity of demand   change in quantity demanded  change in incomeincome elasticity of demand   change in quantity demanded  change in income
__label__1 for most products  most of the time  the income elasticity of demand is positive  that is  a rise in income will cause an increase in the quantity demanded
__label__0 this pattern is common enough that these goods are referred to as normal goods
__label__0 however  for a few goods  an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good  for example  those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers  because they are buying more steak instead  or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer
__label__0 elasticity in labor and financial capital marketsthe concept of elasticity applies to any market  not just markets for goods and services
__label__0 in the labor market  for example  the wage elasticity of labor supply  that is  the percentage change in hours worked divided by the percentage change in wages  will determine the shape of the labor supply curve
__label__0 specifically
__label__0 if the firm is successful  the outputs are more valuable than the inputs
__label__0 this activity of production goes beyond manufacturing  ie  making things
__label__0 it includes any process or service that creates value  including transportation  distribution  wholesale and retail sales
__label__0 wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs
__label__0 implicit costs are more subtle  but just as important
__label__1 they represent the opportunity cost of using resources already owned by the firm
__label__0 the cost of producing a firm s output depends on how much labor and physical capital the firm uses
__label__0 a list of the costs involved in producing cars will look very different from the costs involved in producing computer software or haircuts or fast  food meals
__label__1 variable costs  on the other hand  are incurred in the act of producing  the more you produce  the greater the variable cost
__label__0 labor is treated as a variable cost  since producing a greater quantity of a good or service typically requires more workers or more work hours
__label__0 but as output expands still further  the average cost begins to rise
__label__0 at the right side of the average cost curve  total costs begin rising more rapidly as diminishing returns kick in
__label__0 average variable cost obtained when variable cost is divided by quantity of output
__label__0 for example  the variable cost of producing  haircuts is    so the average variable cost is      or   per haircut
__label__0 average cost tells a firm whether it can earn profits given the current price in the market
__label__1 if we divide profit by the quantity of output produced we get average profit  also known as the firm s profit margin
__label__0 expanding the equation for profit gives
__label__0 while in the short run firms are limited to operating on a single average cost curve  corresponding to the level of fixed costs they have chosen   in the long run when all costs are variable  they can choose to operate on any average cost curve
__label__0 thus  the long  run average cost  lrac  curve is actually based on a group of short  run average cost  srac  curves  each of which represents one specific level of fixed costs
__label__1 more precisely  the long  run average cost curve will be the least expensive average cost curve for any level of output
__label__0 diseconomies of scale can also be present across an entire firm  not just a large factory
__label__0 the leviathan effect can hit firms that become too large to run efficiently  across the entirety of the enterprise
__label__0 firms that shrink their operations are often responding to finding itself in the diseconomies region  thus moving back to a lower average cost at a lower output level
__label__0 visit this website to read an article about the complexity of the belief that banks can be  too  big  to  fail
__label__1 what a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price
__label__1 the total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded
__label__0 a rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service
__label__0 the quantity demanded is measured in millions of gallons over some time period  for example  per day or per year  and over some geographic area  like a state or a country
__label__1 a demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like  link   with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis
__label__0 note that this is an exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent variable  x  goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable  y  goes on the vertical
__label__1 price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service
__label__0 a rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service  while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied
__label__0 when the price of gasoline rises  for example  it encourages profit  seeking firms to take several actions  expand exploration for oil reserves  drill for more oil  invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline  build new oil refineries  purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations  and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours
__label__0 again  price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons
__label__1 a supply curve is a graphic illustration of the relationship between price  shown on the vertical axis  and quantity  shown on the horizontal axis
__label__0 the supply schedule and the supply curve are just two different ways of showing the same information
__label__1 the equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree  that is  where the amount of the product consumers want to buy  quantity demanded  is equal to the amount producers want to sell  quantity supplied
__label__1 the equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree  that is  where the amount of the product consumers want to buy  quantity demanded  is equal to the amount producers want to sell  quantity supplied
__label__0 this common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity
__label__0 at any other price  the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied  so the market is not in equilibrium at that price
__label__0 the previous module explored how price affects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied
__label__0 the result was the demand curve and the supply curve
__label__0 for some  luxury cars  vacations in europe  and fine jewelry  the effect of a rise in income can be especially pronounced
__label__1 a product whose demand rises when income rises  and vice versa  is called a normal good
__label__0 a few exceptions to this pattern do exist
__label__0 the demand for a product can also be affected by changes in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or complements
__label__1 a substitute is a good or service that can be used in place of another good or service
__label__0 as electronic books  like this one  become more available  you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional printed books
__label__0 if other factors relevant to supply do change  then the entire supply curve will shift
__label__0 just as a shift in demand is represented by a change in the quantity demanded at every price  a shift in supply means a change in the quantity supplied at every price
__label__0 according to the pew research center for people and the press  more and more people  especially younger people  are getting their news from online and digital sources
__label__0 the majority of us adults now own smartphones or tablets  and most of those americans say they use them in part to get the news
__label__1 laws that government enacts to regulate prices are called price controls
__label__0 price controls come in two flavors
__label__0 markets for labor have demand and supply curves  just like markets for goods
__label__0 the law of demand applies in labor markets this way  a higher salary or wage  that is  a higher price in the labor market  leads to a decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers  while a lower salary or wage leads to an increase in the quantity of labor demanded
__label__0 the law of supply functions in labor markets  too  a higher price for labor leads to a higher quantity of labor supplied  a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied
__label__0 equilibrium in the labor market
__label__1 the demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or wage rate  under the ceteris paribus assumption
__label__0 a change in the wage or salary will result in a change in the quantity demanded of labor
__label__0 some was invested in private companies or loaned to government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for purposes like building roads or mass transit
__label__0 some firms reinvested their savings in their own businesses
__label__0 in this section  we will determine how the demand and supply model links those who wish to supply financial capital  ie  savings  with those who demand financial capital  ie  borrowing
__label__0 those who save money  or make financial investments  which is the same thing   whether individuals or businesses  are on the supply side of the financial market
__label__1 participants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to consume goods  now or in the future
__label__0 economists call this intertemporal decision making because it involves decisions across time
__label__0 unlike a decision about what to buy from the grocery store  decisions about investment or saving are made across a period of time  sometimes a long period
__label__0 a change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to other markets
__label__0 the vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach equilibrium and linking different markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so counterproductive
__label__1 price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the various markets to determine prices
__label__0 if jos had unlimited income or goods were free  then he could consume without limit
__label__0 but jos  like all of us  faces a budget constraint
__label__0 jos has a total of   to spend
__label__0 the fourth t  shirt is just to something to wear when all his other clothes are in the wash and yields only  additional utils
__label__1 this is an example of the law of diminishing marginal utility  which holds that the additional utility decreases with each unit added
__label__0 the general rule can also be expressed as the ratio of the prices of the two goods should be equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities
__label__1 when the price of good  is divided by the price of good   at the utility  maximizing point this will equal the marginal utility of good  divided by the marginal utility of good
__label__0 this rule  known as the consumer equilibrium  can be written in algebraic form
__label__0 conversely  when income falls  the most typical reaction is to purchase less of both goods
__label__1 as defined in the chapter on demand and supply and again in the chapter on elasticity  goods and services are called normal goods when a rise in income leads to a rise in the quantity consumed of that good and a fall in income leads to a fall in quantity consumed
__label__0 however  depending on kimberly s preferences  a rise in income could cause consumption of one good to increase while consumption of the other good declines
__label__0 a choice like p means that a rise in income caused her quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline  while a choice like q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to decline
__label__1 the substitution effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price
__label__1 the income effect is that a higher price means  in effect  the buying power of income has been reduced  even though actual income has not changed   which leads to buying less of the good  when the good is normal
__label__0 in this example  the higher price for baseball bats would cause sergei to buy a fewer bats for both reasons
__label__0 the middle  close  to  vertical portion of the labor supply curve reflects the situation of a person who reacts to a higher wage by supplying about the same quantity of labor
__label__1 the very top portion of the labor supply curve is called a backward  bending supply curve for labor  which is the situation of high  wage people who can earn so much that they respond to a still  higher wage by working fewer hours
__label__0 read the following clear it up feature for more on the number of hours the average person works each year
__label__0 yelberton will compare the different choices along the budget constraint and choose the one that provides him with the highest utility
__label__0 for example  he will compare the utility he would receive from a choice like point a  with consumption of   million in the present  zero savings  and zero future consumption  point b  with present consumption of    savings of    and future consumption of    point c  with present consumption of    savings of    and future consumption of    or even choice d  with present consumption of zero  savings of    and future consumption of
__label__1 we tend to focus more on the loss than the gain
__label__0 this is known as loss aversion  where a   loss pains us  times more than a   gain helps us  according to the economists daniel kahneman and amos tversky in a famous  article in the journal econometrica
__label__0 this insight has implications for investing  as people tend to  overplay  the stock market by reacting more to losses than to gains
__label__1 firms are said to be in perfect competition when the following conditions occur     many firms produce identical products     many buyers are available to buy the product  and many sellers are available to sell the product     sellers and buyers have all relevant information to make rational decisions about the product being bought and sold  and    firms can enter and leave the market without any restrictions  in other words  there is free entry and exit into and out of the market
__label__0 total revenue and total costs for the raspberry farm  broken down into fixed and variable costs  are shown in  link  and also appear in  link
__label__0 the horizontal axis shows the quantity of frozen raspberries produced in packs  the vertical axis shows both total revenue and total costs  measured in dollars
__label__0 new firms may start production  as well
__label__1 when new firms enter the industry in response to increased industry profits it is called entry
__label__0 losses are the black thundercloud that causes businesses to flee
__label__0 if a business is making losses in the short run  it will either keep limping along or just shut down  depending on whether its revenues are covering its variable costs
__label__0 entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces behind a process that  in the long run  pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms are earning a zero profit  to understand how short  run profits for a perfectly competitive firm will evaporate in the long run  imagine the following situation
__label__0 the market is in long  run equilibrium  where all firms earn zero economic profits producing the output level where p  mr  mc and p  ac
__label__0 no firm has the incentive to enter or leave the market
__label__1 for a decreasing cost industry  as the market expands  the old and new firms experience lower costs of production  which makes the new zero  profit level intersect at a lower price than before
__label__0 in this case  the industry and all the firms in it are experiencing falling average total costs
__label__0 in this chapter  we explore the opposite extreme  monopoly  if perfect competition is a market where firms have no market power and they simply respond to the market price  monopoly is a market with no competition at all  and firms have complete market power
__label__1 in the case of monopoly  one firm produces all of the output in a market
__label__0 since a monopoly faces no significant competition  it can charge any price it wishes
__label__1 one is natural monopoly  where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition
__label__1 the other is legal monopoly  where laws prohibit  or severely limit  competition
__label__1 a trademark is an identifying symbol or name for a particular good  like chiquita bananas  chevrolet cars  or the nike  swoosh  that appears on shoes and athletic gear
__label__0 roughly  million trademarks are registered with the us government
__label__1 taken together  this combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  and trade secret law is called intellectual property  because it implies ownership over an idea  concept  or image  not a physical piece of property like a house or a car
__label__0 countries around the world have enacted laws to protect intellectual property  although the time periods and exact provisions of such laws vary across countries
__label__0 profits for the monopolist  like any firm  will be equal to total revenues minus total costs
__label__0 the pattern of costs for the monopoly can be analyzed within the same framework as the costs of a perfectly competitive firm  that is  by using total cost  fixed cost  variable cost  marginal cost  average cost  and average variable cost
__label__0 however  because a monopoly faces no competition  its situation and its decision process will differ from that of a perfectly competitive firm
__label__1 link  repeats the marginal cost and marginal revenue data from  link   and adds two more columns  marginal profit is the profitability of each additional unit sold
__label__0 it is defined as marginal revenue minus marginal cost
__label__0 what about the vast majority of real world firms and organizations that fall between these extremes  firms that could be described as imperfectly competitive
__label__0 what determines their behavior
__label__1 monopolistic competition involves many firms competing against each other  but selling products that are distinctive in some way
__label__0 examples include stores that sell different styles of clothing  restaurants or grocery stores that sell different kinds of food  and even products like golf balls or beer that may be at least somewhat similar but differ in public perception because of advertising and brand names
__label__1 a monopolistically competitive firm perceives a demand for its goods that is an intermediate case between monopoly and competition
__label__0 link  offers a reminder that the demand curve as faced by a perfectly competitive firm is perfectly elastic or flat  because the perfectly competitive firm can sell any quantity it wishes at the prevailing market price
__label__0 in contrast  the demand curve  as faced by a monopolist  is the market demand curve  since a monopolist is the only firm in the market  and hence is downward sloping
__label__0 as long as the firm is earning positive economic profits  new competitors will continue to enter the market  reducing the original firm s demand and marginal revenue curves
__label__0 the long  run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point y  where the firm s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve
__label__0 the long  term result of entry and exit in a perfectly competitive market is that all firms end up selling at the price level determined by the lowest point on the average cost curve
__label__0 this outcome is why perfect competition displays productive efficiency  goods are being produced at the lowest possible average cost
__label__0 however  in monopolistic competition  the end result of entry and exit is that firms end up with a price that lies on the downward  sloping portion of the average cost curve  not at the very bottom of the ac curve
__label__0 similarly  a natural monopoly will arise when the quantity demanded in a market is only large enough for a single firm to operate at the minimum of the long  run average cost curve
__label__0 in such a setting  the market has room for only one firm  because no smaller firm can operate at a low enough average cost to compete  and no larger firm could sell what it produced given the quantity demanded in the market
__label__1 when firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high  it is called collusion
__label__1 a group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel
__label__0 see the following clear it up feature for a more in  depth analysis of the difference between the two
__label__1 because of the complexity of oligopoly  which is the result of mutual interdependence among firms  there is no single  generally  accepted theory of how oligopolies behave  in the same way that we have theories for all the other market structures
__label__1 instead  economists use game theory  a branch of mathematics that analyzes situations in which players must make decisions and then receive payoffs based on what other players decide to do
__label__0 game theory has found widespread applications in the social sciences  as well as in business  law  and military strategy
__label__0 the result of this prisoner s dilemma is often that even though a and b could make the highest combined profits by cooperating in producing a lower level of output and acting like a monopolist  the two firms may well end up in a situation where they each increase output and earn only   each in profits
__label__0 the following clear it up feature discusses one cartel scandal in particular
__label__0 if one firm cuts its price to    it will be able to sell only  seats
__label__0 however  if the airline seeks to raise prices  the other oligopolists will not raise their prices  and so the firm that raised prices will lose a considerable share of sales
__label__1 a corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm
__label__1 when one firm purchases another  it is called an acquisition
__label__0 an acquisition may not look just like a merger  since the newly purchased firm may continue to be operated under its former company name
__label__0 in an early demonstration of the law s power  the us supreme court in  upheld the government s right to break up standard oil  which had controlled about   of the country s oil refining  into  independent firms  including exxon  mobil  amoco  and chevron
__label__1 in   the clayton antitrust act outlawed mergers and acquisitions  where the outcome would be to  substantially lessen competition  in an industry   price discrimination  where different customers are charged different prices for the same product   and tied sales  where purchase of one product commits the buyer to purchase some other product
__label__1 in   the clayton antitrust act outlawed mergers and acquisitions  where the outcome would be to  substantially lessen competition  in an industry   price discrimination  where different customers are charged different prices for the same product   and tied sales  where purchase of one product commits the buyer to purchase some other product
__label__0 also in   the federal trade commission  ftc  was created to define more specifically what competition was unfair
__label__1 an early tool was the concentration ratio  which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms  typically the top four to eight firms
__label__0 for an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy  refer to monopoly  say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has  firms with the market shares shown in  link   where the market share is each firm s proportion of total sales in that market
__label__0 the four  firm concentration ratio is calculated by adding the market shares of the four largest firms  in this case
__label__0 however  in the total market for all computer software and services  including everything from games to scientific programs  the microsoft share was only about   in
__label__1 a narrowly defined market will tend to make concentration appear higher  while a broadly defined market will tend to make it appear smaller  there are two especially important shifts affecting how markets are defined in recent decades  one centers on technology and the other centers on globalization
__label__0 in addition  these two shifts are interconnected
__label__1 antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices  practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced  but that might have the effect of reducing competition
__label__0 antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial  because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others
__label__1 for example  if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement  which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price
__label__0 a minimum price contract is illegal because it would restrict competition among dealers
__label__0 even if a customer was interested in a portable tv  the tying to a particular model prevents the customer from having the option of selecting one from the numerous types available in the market
__label__1 a related  but not identical  concept is called bundling  where two or more products are sold as one
__label__0 bundling typically offers an advantage for the consumer by allowing them to acquire multiple products or services for a better price
__label__0 a natural monopoly poses a difficult challenge for competition policy  because the structure of costs and demand seems to make competition unlikely or costly
__label__1 a natural monopoly arises when average costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies market demand
__label__0 this typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to variable costs
__label__1 they calculated the average cost of production for the water or electricity companies  added in an amount for the normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn  and set the price for consumers accordingly
__label__0 this method was known as cost  plus regulation
__label__1 one difficulty with government price regulation is what economists call regulatory capture  in which the firms supposedly being regulated end up playing a large role in setting the regulations that they will follow
__label__0 when the airline industry was being regulated  for example  it suggested appointees to the regulatory board  sent lobbyists to argue with the board  provided most of the information on which the board made decisions  and offered well  paid jobs to at least some of the people leaving the board
__label__0 private markets  such as the cell phone industry  offer an efficient way to put buyers and sellers together and determine what goods are produced  how they are produced  and who gets them
__label__0 the principle that voluntary exchange benefits both buyers and sellers is a fundamental building block of the economic way of thinking
__label__1 because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved  they are sometimes called spillovers
__label__0 externalities can be negative or positive
__label__0 if you hate country music  then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality
__label__0 if you love country music  then what amounts to a series of free concerts would be a positive externality
__label__0 in a market with no anti  pollution restrictions  firms can dispose of certain wastes absolutely free
__label__0 now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution  that is  the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator  but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution
__label__0 if the firm is required to pay   for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator  production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by
__label__0 other laws required the installation of certain equipment  for example  on automobile tailpipes or on smokestacks  to reduce pollution
__label__0 these types of laws  which specify allowable quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution  control technologies must be used  fall under the category of command  and  control regulation
__label__1 in effect  command  and  control regulation requires that firms increase their costs by installing anti  pollution equipment  firms are thus required to take the social costs of pollution into account
__label__0 command  and  control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and cleaning up the us environment
__label__1 a pollution charge is a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that a firm emits
__label__0 a pollution charge gives a profit  maximizing firm an incentive to figure out ways to reduce its emissions  as long as the marginal cost of reducing the emissions is less than the tax
__label__0 another application of marketable permits occurred when the clean air act was amended in
__label__0 the revised law sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants to half of the  levels out of concern that sulfur dioxide was causing acid rain  which harms forests as well as buildings
__label__1 the definition of ecotourism is a little vague
__label__0 does it mean sleeping on the ground  eating roots  and getting close to wild animals
__label__0 no nation by itself can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by enough to solve the problem of global warming  not without the cooperation of other nations
__label__1 another issue is the challenge of preserving biodiversity  which includes the full spectrum of animal and plant genetic material
__label__0 although a nation can protect biodiversity within its own borders  no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity around the world
__label__1 the tradeoff between economic output and the environment can be analyzed with a production possibility frontier  ppf  such as the one shown in  link
__label__0 at one extreme  at a choice like p  a country would be selecting a high level of economic output but very little environmental protection
__label__1 depending on their different income levels and political preferences  countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency  that is  the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier
__label__1 however  all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency  that is  the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it
__label__0 revisit choice in a world of scarcity for more on these terms
__label__0 will private firms in a market economy under invest in research and technology
__label__0 if a firm builds a factory or buys a piece of equipment  the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments
__label__1 the social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product  whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole  as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology
__label__1 as you learned in environmental protection and negative externalities  positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party  or parties  consider the example of the big drug company  which is planning its rd budget for the next year
__label__0 economists and scientists working for big drug have compiled a list of potential research and development projects and estimated rates of return
__label__0 after all  if the government is spending taxpayer dollars to subsidize public education  society should expect some kind of return on that spending
__label__0 again  economists like george psacharopoulos have found that  across a variety of nations  the social rate of return on schooling is also positive
__label__0 after all  positive externalities exist from investment in education
__label__1 intellectual property rights include patents  which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make  use  or sell the invention for a limited time  and copyright laws  which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of literature  music  film  video  and pictures
__label__0 for example  if a pharmaceutical firm has a patent on a new drug  then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for twenty  one years  unless the firm with the patent grants permission
__label__0 without a patent  the pharmaceutical firm would have to face competition for any successful products  and could earn no more than a normal rate of profit
__label__0 other institutions  such as the national academy of scientists and the national academy of engineers  receive federal grants for innovative projects
__label__1 the agriculture and food research initiative  afri  at the united states department of agriculture awards federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most important agricultural problems  from food safety to childhood obesity
__label__0 cooperation between government  funded universities  academies  and the private sector can spur product innovation and create whole new industries
__label__1 the second main characteristic of a public good  that it is nonrivalrous  means that when one person uses the public good  another can also use it
__label__0 this is an example of induced polarization of neutral objects
__label__1 polarization is the separation of charges in an object that remains neutral
__label__0 on a large scale  such as between the earth and a person  the reverse is true
__label__0 most objects are nearly electrically neutral  and so attractive and repulsive coulomb forces nearly cancel
__label__0 gravitational force on a large scale dominates interactions between large objects because it is always attractive  while coulomb forces tend to cancel
__label__1 the magnitude of the dipole is called the dipole moment  these two centers of charge will terminate some of the electric field lines coming from a free charge  as on a dna molecule
__label__0 this results in a reduction in the strength of the coulomb interaction
__label__0 one might say that screening makes the coulomb force a short range force rather than long range
__label__0 a conductor placed in an electric field will be polarized
__label__0 link  shows the result of placing a neutral conductor in an originally uniform electric field
__label__1 the familiar term voltage is the common name for potential difference
__label__0 keep in mind that whenever a voltage is quoted  it is understood to be the potential difference between two points
__label__1 van de graaff generators  or van de graaffs  are not only spectacular devices used to demonstrate high voltage due to static electricity  they are also used for serious research
__label__0 the first was built by robert van de graaff in   based on original suggestions by lord kelvin  for use in nuclear physics research
__label__0 large electrostatic precipitators are used industrially to remove over   of the particles from stack gas emissions associated with the burning of coal and oil
__label__0 home precipitators  often in conjunction with the home heating and air conditioning system  are very effective in removing polluting particles  irritants  and allergens
__label__0 the more easily it is polarized  the greater its dielectric constant   size   k
__label__0 water  for example  is a polar molecule because one end of the molecule has a slight positive charge and the other end has a slight negative charge
__label__0 the polarity of water causes it to have a relatively large dielectric constant of
__label__0 link  shows the schematic for a simple circuit
__label__1 a simple circuit has a single voltage source and a single resistor
__label__1 the wires connecting the voltage source to the resistor can be assumed to have negligible resistance  or their resistance can be included in rr size   r
__label__0 link  shows a schematic of a simple circuit with an ac voltage source
__label__0 the voltage between the terminals fluctuates as shown  with the ac voltage given by
__label__0 electric power causes undesired heating effects whenever electric energy is converted to thermal energy at a rate faster than it can be safely dissipated
__label__1 a classic example of this is the short circuit  a low  resistance path between terminals of a voltage source
__label__0 an example of a short circuit is shown in  link
__label__1 nerve conduction is a general term for electrical signals carried by nerve cells
__label__1 it is one aspect of bioelectricity  or electrical effects in and created by biological systems
__label__1 most circuits have more than one component  called a resistor that limits the flow of charge in the circuit
__label__1 a measure of this limit on charge flow is called resistance
__label__0 when are resistors in series
__label__1 resistors are in series whenever the flow of charge  called the current  must flow through devices sequentially
__label__0 for example  if current flows through a person holding a screwdriver and into the earth  then r r size   r rsub  size         in  link   a  could be the resistance of the screwdriver s shaft  r r size   r rsub  size         the resistance of its handle  r r size   r rsub  size         the person s body resistance  and r r size   r rsub  size         the resistance of her shoes
__label__0 link  shows resistors in series connected to a voltage source
__label__0 the loop rule is stated in terms of potential  v v size   v     rather than potential energy  but the two are related since pe elec  q vpe elec  q v size   ital
__label__1 recall that emf is the potential difference of a source when no current is flowing
__label__0 in a closed loop  whatever energy is supplied by emf must be transferred into other forms by devices in the loop  since there are no other ways in which energy can be transferred into or out of the circuit
__label__0 the two crucial characteristics of a given galvanometer are its resistance and current sensitivity
__label__1 current sensitivity is the current that gives a full  scale deflection of the galvanometer s needle  the maximum current that the instrument can measure
__label__0 for example  a galvanometer with a current sensitivity of  a a has a maximum deflection of its needle when  a  a flows through it  reads half  scale when  a  a size
__label__1 only certain materials  such as iron  cobalt  nickel  and gadolinium  exhibit strong magnetic effects
__label__0 such materials are called ferromagnetic  after the latin word for iron  ferrum
__label__0 a group of materials made from the alloys of the rare earth elements are also used as strong and permanent magnets  a popular one is neodymium
__label__0 increased thermal motion at higher temperature can disrupt and randomize the orientation and the size of the domains
__label__1 there is a well  defined temperature for ferromagnetic materials  which is called the curie temperature  above which they can not be magnetized
__label__0 the curie temperature for iron is  k    c     c  size
__label__1 a current loop always produces a magnetic dipole  that is  a magnetic field that acts like a north pole and south pole pair
__label__1 since isolated north and south magnetic poles  called magnetic monopoles  are not observed  currents are used to explain all magnetic effects
__label__0 if magnetic monopoles did exist  then we would have to modify this underlying connection that all magnetism is due to electrical current
__label__0 the pictorial representation of magnetic field lines is very useful in visualizing the strength and direction of the magnetic field
__label__1 as shown in  link   the direction of magnetic field lines is defined to be the direction in which the north end of a compass needle points
__label__0 the magnetic field is traditionally called the b  field  magnetic field lines are defined to have the direction that a small compass points when placed at a location
__label__0 motors are the most common application of magnetic force on current  carrying wires
__label__0 motors have loops of wire in a magnetic field
__label__0 the magnetic field strength  magnitude  produced by a long straight current  carrying wire is found by experiment to be
__label__1 this results in a more complete law  called ampere s law  which relates magnetic field and current in a general way
__label__1 ampere s law in turn is a part of maxwell s equations  which give a complete theory of all electromagnetic phenomena
__label__0 considerations of how maxwell s equations appear to different observers led to the modern theory of relativity  and the realization that electric and magnetic fields are different manifestations of the same thing
__label__0 only near the ends does it begin to weaken and change direction
__label__0 the field outside has similar complexities to flat loops and bar magnets  but the magnetic field strength inside a solenoid is simply
__label__0 these can be measured but with some difficulty since their strengths are about      size
__label__1 recording of the heart s magnetic field as it beats is called a magnetocardiogram  mcg   while measurements of the brain s magnetic field is called a magnetoencephalogram  meg
__label__0 both give information that differs from that obtained by measuring the electric fields of these organs  ecgs and eegs   but they are not yet of sufficient importance to make these difficult measurements common
__label__1 the minus means that the emf creates a current i and magnetic field b that oppose the change in flux   size        this is known as lenz s law
__label__0 the direction  given by the minus sign  of the emfis so important that it is called lenz s law after the russian heinrich lenz       who  like faraday and henry  independently investigated aspects of induction
__label__0 faraday was aware of the direction  but lenz stated it so clearly that he is credited for its discovery
__label__1 if motional emf can cause a current loop in the conductor  we refer to that current as an eddy current
__label__1 eddy currents can produce significant drag  called magnetic damping  on the motion involved
__label__0 consider the apparatus shown in  link   which swings a pendulum bob between the poles of a strong magnet
__label__0 that is  when a motor is doing work and its shaft is turning  an emf is generated
__label__1 lenz s law tells us the emf opposes any change  so that the input emf that powers the motor will be opposed by the motor s self  generated emf  called the back emf of the motor
__label__0 see  link
__label__0 some transformers even provide a variable output by allowing connection to be made at different points on the secondary coil
__label__1 a step  up transformer is one that increases voltage  whereas a step  down transformer decreases voltage
__label__0 assuming  as we have  that resistance is negligible  the electrical power output of a transformer equals its input
__label__0 this is not how power is distributed in practice
__label__0 modern household and industrial wiring requires the three  wire system  shown schematically in  link   which has several safety features
__label__0 first is the familiar circuit breaker  or fuse  to prevent thermal overload
__label__1 self  inductance  the effect of faraday s law of induction of a device on itself  also exists
__label__0 when  for example  current through a coil is increased  the magnetic field and flux also increase  inducing a counter emf  as required by lenz s law
__label__0 many people confuse sound waves with radio waves  one type of electromagnetic  em  wave
__label__0 however  sound and radio waves are completely different phenomena
__label__0 magnetic field lines are continuous  having no beginning or end
__label__0 no magnetic monopoles are known to exist
__label__0 the electric and magnetic fields produced by a long straight wire antenna are exactly in phase
__label__1 note that they are perpendicular to one another and to the direction of propagation  making this a transverse wave
__label__1 the broad category of radio waves is defined to contain any electromagnetic wave produced by currents in wires and circuits
__label__0 its name derives from their most common use as a carrier of audio information  ie  radio
__label__0 see  link
__label__0 a carrier wave having the basic frequency of the radio station  say  khz  is varied or modulated in amplitude by an audio signal
__label__0 the resulting wave has a constant frequency  but a varying amplitude
__label__0 the entire fm radio band lies between channels  mhz and  mhz
__label__0 these tv channels are called vhf  for very high frequency
__label__1 other channels called uhf  for ultra high frequency  utilize an even higher frequency range of  to  mhz
__label__0 since they have high frequencies  their wavelengths are short compared with those of other radio waves  hence the name  microwave   microwaves can also be produced by atoms and molecules
__label__0 they are  for example  a component of electromagnetic radiation generated by thermal agitation
__label__0 the thermal motion of atoms and molecules in any object at a temperature above absolute zero causes them to emit and absorb radiation
__label__1 visible light is the narrow segment of the electromagnetic spectrum to which the normal human eye responds
__label__0 visible light is produced by vibrations and rotations of atoms and molecules  as well as by electronic transitions within atoms and molecules
__label__0 anyone who has used a microwave oven knows there is energy in electromagnetic waves
__label__0 sometimes this energy is obvious  such as in the warmth of the summer sun
__label__0 light may change direction when it encounters objects  such as a mirror  or in passing from one material to another  such as in passing from air to glass   but it then continues in a straight line or as a ray
__label__1 the word ray comes from mathematics and here means a straight line that originates at some point
__label__0 it is acceptable to visualize light rays as laser rays  or even science fiction depictions of ray guns
__label__0 ray
__label__0 in communications  it is used to transmit telephone  internet  and cable tv signals
__label__1 fiber optics employs the transmission of light down fibers of plastic or glass
__label__0 because the fibers are thin  light entering one is likely to strike the inside surface at an angle greater than the critical angle and  thus  be totally reflected  see  link
__label__0 what this implies is that white light is spread out according to wavelength in a rainbow
__label__1 dispersion is defined as the spreading of white light into its full spectrum of wavelengths
__label__0 more technically  dispersion occurs whenever there is a process that changes the direction of light in a manner that depends on wavelength
__label__0 link  shows a concave lens and the effect it has on rays of light that enter it parallel to its axis  the path taken by ray  in the figure is the axis of the lens
__label__1 the concave lens is a diverging lens  because it causes the light rays to bend away  diverge  from its axis
__label__0 in this case  the lens has been shaped so that all light rays entering it parallel to its axis appear to originate from the same point  ff size   f     defined to be the focal point of a diverging lens
__label__1 the image formed in  link  is a real image  meaning that it can be projected
__label__0 that is  light rays from one point on the object actually cross at the location of the image and can be projected onto a screen  a piece of film  or the retina of an eye  for example
__label__0 when an optometrist identifies accommodation as a problem in elder people  it is most likely due to stiffening of the lens
__label__1 the lens of the eye changes with age in ways that tend to preserve the ability to see distant objects clearly but do not allow the eye to accommodate for close vision  a condition called presbyopia  literally  elder eye
__label__0 to correct this vision defect  we place a converging  positive power lens in front of the eye  such as found in reading glasses
__label__1 the distance to the farthest object that can be seen clearly is called the far point of the eye  normally infinity
__label__1 farsightedness  or hyperopia  is the inability to see close objects clearly while distant objects may be clear
__label__0 a farsighted eye does not converge sufficient rays from a close object to make the rays meet on the retina
__label__0 laser vision correction has progressed rapidly in the last few years
__label__0 it is the latest and by far the most successful in a series of procedures that correct vision by reshaping the cornea
__label__0 there are three types of cones  and each type is sensitive to different ranges of wavelengths  as illustrated in  link
__label__1 a simplified theory of color vision is that there are three primary colors corresponding to the three types of cones
__label__0 the thousands of other hues that we can distinguish among are created by various combinations of stimulations of the three types of cones
__label__1 each retinex forms an image that is compared with the others  and the eye  brain system thus can compare a candle  illuminated white table cloth with its generally reddish surroundings and determine that it is actually white
__label__0 this retinex theory of color vision is an example of modified theories of color vision that attempt to account for its subtleties
__label__0 one striking experiment performed by land demonstrates that some type of image comparison may produce color vision
__label__0 the initial stage of the project is the construction of the australian square kilometre array pathfinder in western australia  see  link
__label__1 the project will use cutting  edge technologies such as adaptive optics in which the lens or mirror is constructed from lots of carefully aligned tiny lenses and mirrors that can be manipulated using computers
__label__0 a range of rapidly changing distortions can be minimized by deforming or tilting the tiny lenses and mirrors
__label__0 furthermore  young first passed light from a single source  the sun  through a single slit to make the light somewhat coherent
__label__1 by coherent  we mean waves are in phase or have a definite phase relationship
__label__1 incoherent means the waves have random phase relationships
__label__0 there are specific directions for the oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields
__label__1 polarization is the attribute that a wave s oscillations have a definite direction relative to the direction of propagation of the wave
__label__0 this is not the same type of polarization as that discussed for the separation of charges
__label__0 to examine this further  consider the transverse waves in the ropes shown in  link
__label__1 the oscillations in one rope are in a vertical plane and are said to be vertically polarized
__label__0 those in the other rope are in a horizontal plane and are horizontally polarized
__label__0 einstein essentially did the theoretical aspect of this method for relativity
__label__0 with two deceptively simple postulates and a careful consideration of how measurements are made  he produced the theory of special relativity  einstein s first postulate
__label__0 not only are laws of physics simplest in inertial frames  but they should be the same in all inertial frames  since there is no preferred frame and no absolute motion
__label__0 einstein incorporated these ideas into his first postulate of special relativity
__label__0 first postulate of special relativity
__label__1 time dilation is the phenomenon of time passing slower for an observer who is moving relative to another observer
__label__0 just as with classical physics  quantum physics has several subfields  such as mechanics and the study of electromagnetic forces
__label__1 the correspondence principle states that in the classical limit  large  slow  moving objects   quantum mechanics becomes the same as classical physics
__label__0 in this chapter  we begin the development of quantum mechanics and its description of the strange submicroscopic world
__label__0 when light strikes materials  it can eject electrons from them
__label__1 this is called the photoelectric effect  meaning that light  photo  produces electricity
__label__0 one common use of the photoelectric effect is in light meters  such as those that adjust the automatic iris on various types of cameras
__label__0 a curve like this is obtained by detecting many photons  and it is apparent that the maximum energy is unlikely
__label__1 this decelerating process produces radiation that is called bremsstrahlung  german for braking radiation
__label__1 the second feature is the existence of sharp peaks in the spectrum  these are called characteristic x rays  since they are characteristic of the anode material
__label__0 the range of photon energies for visible light from red to violet is  to  ev  respectively  left for this chapter s problems and exercises to verify
__label__0 these energies are on the order of those between outer electron shells in atoms and molecules
__label__1 the quantum of em radiation we call a photon has properties analogous to those of particles we can see  such as grains of sand
__label__0 a photon interacts as a unit in collisions or when absorbed  rather than as an extensive wave
__label__0 after compiling enough data  you get a distribution related to the particle s wavelength and diffraction pattern
__label__1 there is a certain probability of finding the particle at a given location  and the overall pattern is called a probability distribution
__label__0 those who developed quantum mechanics devised equations that predicted the probability distribution in various circumstances
__label__1 another is what democritus in particular believed  that there is a smallest unit that can not be further subdivided
__label__0 democritus called this the atom
__label__0 we now know that atoms themselves can be subdivided  but their identity is destroyed in the process  so the greeks were correct in a respect
__label__0 based on the size and mass of the nucleus revealed by his experiment  as well as the mass of electrons  rutherford proposed the planetary model of the atom
__label__1 the planetary model of the atom pictures low  mass electrons orbiting a large  mass nucleus
__label__0 double  slit interference  wave optics
__label__0 to obtain constructive interference for a double slit  the path length difference from two slits must be an integral multiple of the wavelength
__label__0 for the orbital energies of hydrogen  like atoms
__label__0 here  e e size   e rsub  size         is the ground  state energy n   n   size   left  n   right     for hydrogen z   z   size   left  z   right     and is given by e     qe  me k  h    e v
__label__0 e      q e  m e k  h    ev
__label__0 thus  for hydrogen
__label__1 thus  typical x  ray photons act like rays when they encounter macroscopic objects  like teeth  and produce sharp shadows  however  since atoms are on the order of  nm in size  x rays can be used to detect the location  shape  and size of atoms and molecules
__label__0 the process is called x  ray diffraction  because it involves the diffraction and interference of x rays to produce patterns that can be analyzed for information about the structures that scattered the x rays
__label__0 perhaps the most famous example of x  ray diffraction is the discovery of the double  helix structure of dna in  by an international team of scientists working at the cavendish laboratory  american james watson  englishman francis crick  and new zealand  born maurice wilkins
__label__0 some of these may be in the visible range  such as for the scorpion in  link
__label__1 fluorescence is defined to be any process in which an atom or molecule  excited by a photon of a given energy  and de  excites by emission of a lower  energy photon  fluorescence can be induced by many types of energy input
__label__0 fluorescent paint  dyes  and even soap residues in clothes make colors seem brighter in sunlight by converting some uv into visible light
__label__0 this includes those electrons originally excited to the metastable state and those that fell into it from above
__label__0 it is possible to get a majority of the atoms into the metastable state  a condition called a population inversion
__label__0 a  energy  level diagram for an atom showing the first few states  one of which is metastable
__label__0 b  massive energy input excites atoms to a variety of states
__label__1 the name hologram means  entire picture   from the greek holo  as in holistic   because the image is three  dimensional
__label__1 holography is the process of producing holograms and  although they are recorded on photographic film  the process is quite different from normal photography
__label__0 the new insight is that the direction of the orbital angular momentum is also quantized
__label__1 the fact that the orbital angular momentum can have only certain directions is called space quantization
__label__0 like many aspects of quantum mechanics  this quantization of direction is totally unexpected
__label__0 that is  no two electrons can be in the same state
__label__1 this statement is known as the pauli exclusion principle  because it excludes electrons from being in the same state
__label__0 the pauli exclusion principle is extremely powerful and very broadly applicable
__label__0 the rays themselves are called nuclear radiation
__label__1 a nucleus that spontaneously destroys part of its mass to emit radiation is said to decay  a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states
__label__1 a substance or object that emits nuclear radiation is said to be radioactive  two types of experimental evidence imply that becquerel s rays originate deep in the heart  or nucleus  of an atom
__label__1 the range of radiation is defined to be the distance it can travel through a material
__label__0 range is related to several factors  including the energy of the radiation  the material encountered  and the type of radiation  see  link
__label__0 scintillator detectors are used in a variety of research and diagnostic applications
__label__0 among these are the detection by satellite  mounted equipment of the radiation from distant galaxies  the analysis of radiation from a person indicating body burdens  and the detection of exotic particles in accelerator laboratories  light from a scintillator is converted into electrical signals by devices such as the photomultiplier tube shown schematically in  link
__label__0 these tubes are based on the photoelectric effect  which is multiplied in stages into a cascade of electrons  hence the name photomultiplier
__label__1 we have already identified protons as the particles that carry positive charge in the nuclei
__label__1 however  there are actually two types of particles in the nuclei  the proton and the neutron  referred to collectively as nucleons  the constituents of nuclei
__label__1 as its name implies  the neutron is a neutral particle  q   q   size   q       that has nearly the same mass and intrinsic spin as the proton
__label__0 nuclear decay has provided an amazing window into the realm of the very small
__label__1 nuclear decay gave the first indication of the connection between mass and energy  and it revealed the existence of two of the four basic forces in nature
__label__0 the neutrino in     size    rsup  size           decay is an electron s antineutrino  given the symbol e e  where  is the greek letter nu  and the subscript e means this neutrino is related to the electron
__label__0 the bar indicates this is a particle of antimatter
__label__0 all particles have antimatter counterparts that are nearly identical except that they have the opposite charge
__label__1 electron capture is the third type of beta decay
__label__0 here  a nucleus captures an inner  shell electron and undergoes a nuclear reaction that has the same effect as   size    rsup  size           decay
__label__0 for an arbitrary time  not just a multiple of the half  life  the exponential relationship must be used  radioactive dating is a clever use of naturally occurring radioactivity
__label__0 its most famous application is carbon dating
__label__1 carbon has a half  life of  years and is produced in a nuclear reaction induced when solar neutrinos strike n n size
__label__1 the probability of finding a particle is related to the square of its wave function  and so there is a small probability of finding the particle outside the barrier  which implies that the particle can tunnel through the barrier
__label__0 this process is called barrier penetration or quantum mechanical tunneling
__label__0 this concept was developed in theory by j robert oppenheimer  who led the development of the first nuclear bombs during world war ii  and was used by gamow and others to describe   size       decay
__label__0 the compound is said to be tagged
__label__1 a tagged compound used for medical purposes is called a radiopharmaceutical
__label__0 radiation detectors external to the body can determine the location and concentration of a radiopharmaceutical to yield medically useful information
__label__1 these  rays have identical   me v energies  the energy comes from the destruction of an electron or positron mass  and they move directly away from one another  allowing detectors to determine their point of origin accurately  as shown in  link
__label__0 the system is called positron emission tomography  pet
__label__0 it requires detectors on opposite sides to simultaneously  ie  at the same time  detect photons of   me v energy and utilizes computer imaging techniques similar to those in spect and ct scans
__label__1 under this assumption  any dose of radiation  no matter how small  involves a risk to human health
__label__0 this is called the linear hypothesis and it may be prudent  but it is controversial
__label__0 there is some evidence that  unlike the immediate effects of radiation  the long  term effects are cumulative and there is little self  repair
__label__1 therapeutic applications of ionizing radiation  called radiation therapy or radiotherapy  have existed since the discovery of x  rays and nuclear radioactivity
__label__0 today  radiotherapy is used almost exclusively for cancer therapy  where it saves thousands of lives and improves the quality of life and longevity of many it can not save
__label__0 how does food irradiation work
__label__1 ionization produces a random assortment of broken molecules and ions  some with unstable oxygen or hydrogen  containing molecules known as free radicals
__label__0 these undergo rapid chemical reactions  producing perhaps four or five thousand different compounds called radiolytic products  some of which make cell function impossible by breaking cell membranes  fracturing dna  and so on
__label__0 these three factors  temperature  density  and time  complement one another  and so a deficiency in one can be compensated for by the others
__label__1 ignition is defined to occur when the reactions produce enough energy to be self  sustaining after external energy input is cut off
__label__0 this goal  which must be reached before commercial plants can be a reality  has not been achieved
__label__1 huge power input heats the fuel  evaporating the confining pellet and crushing the fuel to high density with the expanding hot plasma produced
__label__0 this technique is called inertial confinement  because the fuel s inertia prevents it from escaping before significant fusion can take place
__label__0 higher densities have been reached than with tokamaks  but with smaller confinement times
__label__0 coulomb repulsion between the two ends then succeeds in fissioning the nucleus  which pops like a water drop into two large pieces and a few neutrons
__label__0 neutron  induced fission can be written as
__label__1 to produce large power  reactors contain hundreds to thousands of critical masses  and the chain reaction easily becomes self  sustaining  a condition called criticality
__label__1 neutron flux should be carefully regulated to avoid an exponential increase in fissions  a condition called supercriticality
__label__0 what does the study of biology share with other scientific disciplines
__label__1 science  from the latin scientia  meaning  knowledge   can be defined as knowledge that covers general truths or the operation of general laws  especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method
__label__0 it becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific method plays a major role in science
__label__0 a hypothesis may become a verified theory
__label__1 a theory is a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena
__label__1 science may be better defined as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe
__label__0 a valid hypothesis must be testable
__label__0 it should also be falsifiable  meaning that it can be disproven by experimental results
__label__0 importantly  science does not claim to  prove  anything because scientific understandings are always subject to modification with further information
__label__0 basic science or  pure  science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short  term application of that knowledge
__label__0 it is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value
__label__0 instead  most scientists present their results in peer  reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals
__label__1 peer  reviewed manuscripts are scientific papers that are reviewed by a scientist s colleagues  or peers
__label__0 these colleagues are qualified individuals  often experts in the same research area  who judge whether or not the scientist s work is suitable for publication
__label__0 the introduction refers to the published scientific work of others and therefore requires citations following the style of the journal
__label__1 using the work or ideas of others without proper citation is considered plagiarism
__label__0 the results are presented by means of tables or graphs  but no duplicate information should be presented
__label__0 in the discussion section  the researcher will interpret the results  describe how variables may be related  and attempt to explain the observations
__label__0 it is indispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to put the results in the context of previously published scientific research
__label__0 these conditions may  however  change from one moment to the next
__label__1 organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly  despite environmental changes  through homeostasis  literally   steady state    the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions
__label__0 for example  an organism needs to regulate body temperature through a process known as thermoregulation
__label__1 a molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds
__label__1 many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules  large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization  a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers  which are simpler than macromolecules
__label__1 an example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid  dna    link    which contains the instructions for the structure and functioning of all living organisms
__label__0 cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic
__label__1 prokaryotes are single  celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane  bound nuclei  in contrast  the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane  bound organelles and a membrane  bound nucleus
__label__0 organs are present not only in animals but also in plants
__label__1 an organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs
__label__0 mammals have many organ systems
__label__0 for example  the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations
__label__0 a community is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area
__label__0 for instance  all of the trees  flowers  insects  and other populations in a forest form the forest s community
__label__0 the fact that biology  as a science  has such a broad scope has to do with the tremendous diversity of life on earth
__label__0 the source of this diversity is evolution  the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species
__label__0 evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems
__label__0 for instance  molecular biology and biochemistry study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level  including interactions among molecules such as dna  rna  and proteins  as well as the way they are regulated
__label__0 microbiology  the study of microorganisms  is the study of the structure and function of single  celled organisms
__label__0 it is quite a broad branch itself  and depending on the subject of study  there are also microbial physiologists  ecologists  and geneticists  among others
__label__0 paleontology  another branch of biology  uses fossils to study life s history   link
__label__0 zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants  respectively
__label__0 biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists  ecologists  or physiologists  to name just a few areas
__label__0 to understand how elements come together  we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element  the atom
__label__0 an atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element
__label__0 for example  one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature
__label__0 therefore  the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass  but not to its charge
__label__0 electrons are much smaller in mass than protons  weighing only      grams  or about    of an atomic mass unit
__label__0 hence  they do not contribute much to an element s overall atomic mass
__label__0 this approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number
__label__0 since an element s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers  scientists also determine the atomic mass  which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes
__label__0 often  the resulting number contains a fraction
__label__0 the different elements are organized and displayed in the periodic table
__label__0 devised by russian chemist dmitri mendeleev      in   the table groups elements that  although unique  share certain chemical properties with other elements
__label__0 an early model of the atom was developed in  by danish scientist niels bohr
__label__0 the bohr model shows the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons  with the electrons in circular orbitals at specific distances from the nucleus  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 these orbits form electron shells or energy levels  which are a way of visualizing the number of electrons in the outermost shells
__label__0 hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration  while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable
__label__0 as a result of losing a negatively charged electron  they become positively charged ions
__label__0 group  elements  including fluorine and chlorine  have seven electrons in their outmost shells  so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules  making them negatively charged ions
__label__0 this is because it is energetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable
__label__0 however  since not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells  atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms thereby obtaining the electrons they need to attain a stable electron configuration
__label__0 when two or more atoms chemically bond with each other  the resultant chemical structure is a molecule
__label__0 in the equation below  the reaction includes two hydrogen peroxide molecules and two water molecules
__label__1 this is an example of a balanced chemical equation  wherein the number of atoms of each element is the same on each side of the equation
__label__1 according to the law of conservation of matter  the number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction should be equal  such that no atoms are  under normal circumstances  created or destroyed
__label__0 the equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible
__label__0 reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction
__label__0 in reversible reactions  reactants are turned into products  but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold  characteristic of the particular reaction   some of these products will be converted back into reactants  at this point  the designations of products and reactants are reversed
__label__0 because the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons  each ion has a net charge
__label__1 cations are positive ions that are formed by losing electrons
__label__1 negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions
__label__1 ionic bonds are formed between ions with opposite charges
__label__0 for instance  positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions bond together to make crystals of sodium chloride  or table salt  creating a crystalline molecule with zero net charge
__label__0 there are two types of covalent bonds  polar and nonpolar
__label__1 in a polar covalent bond  shown in  link   the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other
__label__0 because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements  a slightly positive    or slightly negative     charge develops
__label__1 when this happens  a weak interaction occurs between the of the hydrogen from one molecule and the   charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule  usually oxygen or nitrogen  or within the same molecule
__label__0 this interaction is called a hydrogen bond
__label__0 this type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules
__label__1 in contrast  non  polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water  as shown in  link  and separate from it rather than dissolve in it  as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar  an acidic water solution
__label__0 these nonpolar compounds are called hydrophobic  hydro   water   phobic   fearing
__label__1 water also has a high heat of vaporization  the amount of energy required to change one gram of a liquid substance to a gas
__label__0 a considerable amount of heat energy   cal  is required to accomplish this change in water
__label__1 the charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water  surrounding the particle with water molecules
__label__0 this is referred to as a sphere of hydration  or a hydration shell  as illustrated in  link  and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water
__label__0 when ionic compounds are added to water  the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation
__label__1 dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions
__label__1 these cohesive forces are related to water s property of adhesion  or the attraction between water molecules and other molecules
__label__0 this attraction is sometimes stronger than water s cohesive forces  especially when the water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes
__label__0 using the negative logarithm to generate positive integers  high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low ph number  whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high ph
__label__1 an acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions  h  in a solution  usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate
__label__1 a base provides either hydroxide ions  oh   or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions  reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the ph
__label__0 buffers are the key
__label__1 buffers readily absorb excess h or oh   keeping the ph of the body carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival
__label__0 maintaining a constant blood ph is critical to a person s well  being
__label__1 so far  the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been aliphatic hydrocarbons  which consist of linear chains of carbon atoms
__label__1 another type of hydrocarbon  aromatic hydrocarbons  consists of closed rings of carbon atoms
__label__1 molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement  structure  of their atoms andor chemical bonds are known as isomers
__label__1 structural isomers  like butane and isobutene shown in  link  a  differ in the placement of their covalent bonds  both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens  ch   but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties
__label__0 for example  due to their different chemical properties  butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches  whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans
__label__1 geometric isomers  on the other hand  have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the surrounding atoms  especially in carbon  to  carbon double bonds
__label__1 functional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those molecules
__label__0 they are found along the  carbon backbone  of macromolecules
__label__1 most macromolecules are made from single subunits  or building blocks  called monomers
__label__1 the monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers
__label__1 dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed  or  sped up   by specific enzymes  dehydration reactions involve the formation of new bonds  requiring energy  while hydrolysis reactions break bonds and release energy
__label__0 these reactions are similar for most macromolecules  but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific for its class
__label__1 monosaccharides  mono   one   sacchar   sweet   are simple sugars  the most common of which is glucose
__label__0 in monosaccharides  the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven
__label__1 polysaccharidesa long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is known as a polysaccharide  poly   many
__label__0 the chain may be branched or unbranched  and it may contain different types of monosaccharides
__label__1 arthropods  insects  crustaceans  and others  have an outer skeleton  called the exoskeleton  which protects their internal body parts  as seen in the bee in  link
__label__1 arthropods  insects  crustaceans  and others  have an outer skeleton  called the exoskeleton  which protects their internal body parts  as seen in the bee in  link
__label__0 this exoskeleton is made of the biological macromolecule chitin  which is a polysaccharide  containing nitrogen
__label__0 it is made of repeating units of n  acetyl    d  glucosamine  a modified sugar
__label__0 some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin
__label__1 for example  palmitic acid  a saturated fatty acid  is derived from the palm tree
__label__1 arachidic acid is derived from arachis hypogea  the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts
__label__0 consequently  they have to be supplemented through ingestion via the diet
__label__0 omega fatty acids  like that shown in  link   fall into this category and are one of only two known for humans  the other being omega fatty acid
__label__0 these are polyunsaturated fatty acids and are called omega because the third carbon from the end of the hydrocarbon chain is connected to its neighboring carbon by a double bond
__label__0 unlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier  steroids have a fused ring structure
__label__0 although they do not resemble the other lipids  they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobic and insoluble in water
__label__1 hormones are chemical  signaling molecules  usually small proteins or steroids  secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes  including growth  development  metabolism  and reproduction
__label__0 for example  insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose level
__label__0 the sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the protein s shape  size  and function
__label__1 each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond  known as a peptide bond  which is formed by a dehydration reaction
__label__0 the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine  releasing a molecule of water
__label__0 the local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein
__label__0 the most common are the   helix and   pleated sheet structures   link
__label__1 both structures are the   helix structure  the helix held in shape by hydrogen bonds
__label__0 it was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process
__label__1 only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones  or chaperonins  that associate with the target protein during the folding process
__label__0 they act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure  and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded
__label__1 the dna molecules never leave the nucleus but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell
__label__0 this intermediary is the messenger rna  mrna
__label__0 other types of rna  like rrna  trna  and microrna  are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation
__label__0 adenine and guanine are classified as purines
__label__0 the primary structure of a purine is two carbon  nitrogen rings
__label__0 in this way  the mrna is read and the protein product is made
__label__1 ribosomal rna  rrna  is a major constituent of ribosomes on which the mrna binds
__label__0 the rrna ensures the proper alignment of the mrna and the ribosomes  the rrna of the ribosome also has an enzymatic activity  peptidyl transferase  and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids
__label__0 with few exceptions  individual cells can not be seen with the naked eye  so scientists use microscopes  micro   small   scope   to look at   to study them
__label__1 a microscope is an instrument that magnifies an object
__label__1 most photographs of cells are taken with a microscope  and these images can also be called micrographs  the optics of a microscope s lenses change the orientation of the image that the user sees
__label__1 by the late s  botanist matthias schleiden and zoologist theodor schwann were studying tissues and proposed the unified cell theory  which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells  the cell is the basic unit of life  and new cells arise from existing cells
__label__0 rudolf virchow later made important contributions to this theory
__label__0 our natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function  especially in cell biology  and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells   link
__label__1 unlike prokaryotic cells  eukaryotic cells have    a membrane  bound nucleus    numerous membrane  bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum  golgi apparatus  chloroplasts  mitochondria  and others  and   several  rod  shaped chromosomes
__label__1 because a eukaryotic cell s nucleus is surrounded by a membrane  it is often said to have a  true nucleus   the word  organelle  means  little organ   and  as already mentioned  organelles have specialized cellular functions  just as the organs of your body have specialized functions
__label__0 at this point  it should be clear to you that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than prokaryotic cells
__label__1 the cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope  a structure to be discussed shortly
__label__0 it is made up of organelles suspended in the gel  like cytosol  the cytoskeleton  and various chemicals   link
__label__0 even though the cytoplasm consists of  to  percent water  it has a semi  solid consistency  which comes from the proteins within it
__label__1 the nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions  molecules  and rna between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm
__label__1 the nucleoplasm is the semi  solid fluid inside the nucleus  where we find the chromatin and the nucleolus
__label__0 some chromosomes have sections of dna that encode ribosomal rna
__label__1 a darkly staining area within the nucleus called the nucleolus  plural  nucleoli  aggregates the ribosomal rna with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then transported out through the pores in the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm
__label__1 peroxisomes are small  round organelles enclosed by single membranes
__label__0 they carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids
__label__0 animal cells have another set of organelles not found in plant cells  lysosomes
__label__1 the lysosomes are the cell s  garbage disposal
__label__0 in plant cells  the digestive processes take place in vacuoles
__label__0 enzymes within the lysosomes aid the breakdown of proteins  polysaccharides  lipids  nucleic acids  and even worn  out organelles
__label__1 the chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll  which captures the light energy that drives the reactions of photosynthesis
__label__1 the chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll  which captures the light energy that drives the reactions of photosynthesis
__label__0 like plant cells  photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts
__label__0 microfilamentsof the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton  microfilaments are the narrowest
__label__1 they function in cellular movement  have a diameter of about  nm  and are made of two intertwined strands of a globular protein called actin   link
__label__1 to refresh your memory  flagella  singular  flagellum  are long  hair  like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and are used to move an entire cell  for example  sperm  euglena
__label__0 when present  the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella
__label__0 such transport uses the vascular tissues  xylem and phloem  primarily
__label__1 there also exist structural modifications called plasmodesmata  singular  plasmodesma   numerous channels that pass between cell walls of adjacent plant cells  connect their cytoplasm  and enable materials to be transported from cell to cell  and thus throughout the plant   link
__label__0 a plasmodesma is a channel between the cell walls of two adjacent plant cells
__label__0 plasmodesmata allow materials to pass from the cytoplasm of one plant cell to the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell
__label__1 gap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for the transport of ions  nutrients  and other substances that enable cells to communicate   link
__label__0 structurally  however  gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ
__label__0 the main fabric of the membrane is composed of amphiphilic  phospholipid molecules
__label__1 the hydrophilic or  water  loving  areas of these molecules  which look like a collection of balls in an artist s rendition of the model    link   are in contact with the aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell
__label__1 hydrophobic  or water  hating molecules  tend to be non  polar
__label__0 proteins make up the second major component of plasma membranes
__label__1 integral proteins  some specialized types are called integrins  are  as their name suggests  integrated completely into the membrane structure  and their hydrophobic membrane  spanning regions interact with the hydrophobic region of the the phospholipid bilayer   link
__label__0 single  pass integral membrane proteins usually have a hydrophobic transmembrane segment that consists of    amino acids
__label__0 the most direct forms of membrane transport are passive
__label__1 passive transport is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not require the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement
__label__0 in passive transport  substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration
__label__1 in filtration  material moves according to its concentration gradient through a membrane  sometimes the rate of diffusion is enhanced by pressure  causing the substances to filter more rapidly
__label__1 this occurs in the kidney  where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and accompanying dissolved substances  or solutes  out of the blood and into the renal tubules
__label__0 the rate of diffusion in this instance is almost totally dependent on pressure
__label__0 channels are specific for the substance that is being transported
__label__1 channel proteins have hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and extracellular fluids  they additionally have a hydrophilic channel through their core that provides a hydrated opening through the membrane layers   link
__label__0 passage through the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the nonpolar central layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell
__label__1 osmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane  which is inversely proportional to the concentration of solutes
__label__0 while diffusion transports material across membranes and within cells  osmosis transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion of solutes in the water
__label__0 a solution s tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution
__label__1 osmolarity describes the total solute concentration of the solution
__label__0 a solution with low osmolarity has a greater number of water molecules relative to the number of solute particles  a solution with high osmolarity has fewer water molecules with respect to solute particles
__label__1 in an isotonic solution  the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell
__label__0 if the osmolarity of the cell matches that of the extracellular fluid  there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell  although water will still move in and out
__label__0 the electrical gradient of k  a positive ion  also tends to drive it into the cell  but the concentration gradient of k tends to drive k out of the cell   link
__label__1 the combined gradient of concentration and electrical charge that affects an ion is called its electrochemical gradient
__label__1 primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane  which is directly dependent on atp
__label__1 secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require atp
__label__1 a uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule
__label__1 a symporter carries two different ions or molecules  both in the same direction
__label__1 an antiporter also carries two different ions or molecules  but in different directions
__label__1 endocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles  such as large molecules  parts of cells  and even whole cells  into a cell
__label__0 there are different variations of endocytosis  but all share a common characteristic  the plasma membrane of the cell invaginates  forming a pocket around the target particle
__label__0 a variation of pinocytosis is called potocytosis
__label__1 this process uses a coating protein  called caveolin  on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane  which performs a similar function to clathrin
__label__0 the reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis
__label__1 exocytosis is the opposite of the processes discussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid
__label__0 waste material is enveloped in a membrane and fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane
__label__1 anabolic pathways require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones
__label__0 synthesizing sugar from co is one example
__label__0 in most cases  this form is heat energy
__label__1 thermodynamically  heat energy is defined as the energy transferred from one system to another that is not doing work
__label__0 for example  when an airplane flies through the air  some of the energy of the flying plane is lost as heat energy due to friction with the surrounding air
__label__0 if it is released  indeed it would do work
__label__0 because this type of energy refers to the potential to do work  it is called potential energy
__label__0 objects transfer their energy between kinetic and potential in the following way  as the wrecking ball hangs motionless  it has  kinetic and  percent potential energy
__label__0 to calculate g  subtract the amount of energy lost to entropy  denoted as s  from the total energy change of the system
__label__0 this total energy change in the system is called enthalpy and is denoted as h
__label__0 the formula for calculating g is as follows  where the symbol t refers to absolute temperature in kelvin  degrees celsius
__label__1 these reactions have a net release of energy  but still require some energy in the beginning
__label__0 this small amount of energy input necessary for all chemical reactions to occur is called the activation energy  or free energy of activation  and is abbreviated ea   link
__label__0 within the cell  where does energy to power such reactions come from
__label__0 the answer lies with an energy  supplying molecule called adenosine triphosphate  or atp
__label__1 atp is a small  relatively simple molecule   link    but within some of its bonds  it contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work
__label__0 two reactants might also enter a reaction  both become modified  and leave the reaction as two products
__label__1 the location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is called the enzyme s active site
__label__0 the active site is where the  action  happens  so to speak
__label__0 in some cases of enzyme inhibition  for example  an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply block the substrate from binding
__label__1 when this happens  the enzyme is inhibited through competitive inhibition  because an inhibitor molecule competes with the substrate for active site binding   link
__label__1 on the other hand  in noncompetitive inhibition  an inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in a location other than an allosteric site and still manages to block substrate binding to the active site
__label__0 in a most efficient and elegant way  cells have evolved to use the products of their own reactions for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity
__label__1 feedback inhibition involves the use of a reaction product to regulate its own further production   link
__label__0 the cell responds to the abundance of specific products by slowing down production during anabolic or catabolic reactions
__label__0 this intermediate complex allows the atp to transfer its third phosphate group  with its energy  to the substrate  a process called phosphorylation
__label__1 phosphorylation refers to the addition of the phosphate  p
__label__0 this is illustrated by the following generic reaction
__label__1 chemiosmosis  a process of atp production in cellular metabolism  is used to generate  percent of the atp made during glucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight
__label__1 the production of atp using the process of chemiosmosis is called oxidative phosphorylation because of the involvement of oxygen in the process
__label__0 the other mechanism uses a group of integral proteins called glut proteins  also known as glucose transporter proteins
__label__1 these transporters assist in the facilitated diffusion of glucose  glycolysis begins with the six carbon ring  shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three  carbon sugar called pyruvate
__label__0 glycolysis consists of two distinct phases
__label__0 there  pyruvate will be transformed into an acetyl group that will be picked up and activated by a carrier compound called coenzyme a  coa
__label__0 the resulting compound is called acetyl coa
__label__0 coa is made from vitamin b  pantothenic acid
__label__1 the endoplasmic reticulum  er    link   is a series of interconnected membranous sacs and tubules that collectively modifies proteins and synthesizes lipids
__label__0 however  these two functions are performed in separate areas of the er  the rough er and the smooth er  respectively
__label__0 before reaching their final destination  the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles still need to be sorted  packaged  and tagged so that they wind up in the right place
__label__1 sorting  tagging  packaging  and distribution of lipids and proteins takes place in the golgi apparatus  also called the golgi body   a series of flattened membranes   link
__label__0 some type of control exists at each stage of glucose metabolism
__label__0 access of glucose to the cell can be regulated using the glut proteins that transport glucose   link
__label__0 different forms of the glut protein control passage of glucose into the cells of specific tissues
__label__0 the energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy captured and stored by photosynthesis almost  million years ago  plants  algae  and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing photosynthesis   link
__label__1 because they use light to manufacture their own food  they are called photoautotrophs  literally   self  feeders using light
__label__0 other organisms  such as animals  fungi  and most other bacteria  are termed heterotrophs   other feeders    because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs
__label__0 in plants  photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves  which consist of several layers of cells
__label__1 the process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll
__label__0 the gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small  regulated openings called stomata  singular  stoma   which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance
__label__0 chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope  composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane
__label__0 within the chloroplast are stacked  disc  shaped structures called thylakoids
__label__1 embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll  a pigment  molecule that absorbs light  responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material  and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain
__label__1 embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll  a pigment  molecule that absorbs light  responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material  and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain
__label__0 the thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen
__label__1 as shown in  link   a stack of thylakoids is called a granum  and the liquid  filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or  bed   not to be confused with stoma or  mouth   an opening on the leaf epidermis
__label__0 art connection
__label__1 humans can see only a fraction of this energy  which portion is therefore referred to as  visible light
__label__1 the manner in which solar energy travels is described as waves
__label__1 scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its wavelength  the distance between consecutive points of a wave
__label__1 the peduncle attaches the flower to the plant
__label__1 a whorl of sepals  collectively called the calyx  is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the unopened floral bud
__label__0 sepals are usually photosynthetic organs  although there are some exceptions
__label__1 the ovary houses one or more ovules  each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization  the male reproductive organs  the stamens  collectively called the androecium   surround the central carpel
__label__1 stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac  like structure called the anther
__label__1 the other sperm fuses with the n polar nuclei  forming a triploid cell that will develop into the endosperm  which is tissue that serves as a food reserve
__label__1 the zygote develops into an embryo with a radicle  or small root  and one  monocot  or two  dicot  leaf  like organs called cotyledons
__label__0 this difference in the number of embryonic leaves is the basis for the two major groups of angiosperms  the monocots and the eudicots
__label__0 monocots include grasses and lilies  and eudicots or dicots form a polyphyletic group
__label__1 basal angiosperms are a group of plants that are believed to have branched off before the separation into monocots and eudicots because they exhibit traits from both groups
__label__0 they are categorized separately in many classification schemes
__label__1 explore this website for additional information on pollinators  more than  percent of angiosperms depend on animals for pollination  the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma
__label__0 consequently  plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators
__label__0 efforts to preserve biodiversity take several lines of action  from preserving heirloom seeds to barcoding species
__label__1 heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations  as opposed to the seeds used for large  scale agricultural production
__label__1 barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences  taken from a well  characterized portion of the genome  are used to identify a species through dna analysis
__label__0 the first reliable record of gymnosperms dates their appearance to the pennsylvanian period  about  million years ago   link
__label__1 gymnosperms were preceded by progymnosperms  the first naked seed plants  which arose about  million years ago
__label__1 progymnosperms were a transitional group of plants that superficially resembled conifers  cone bearers  because they produced wood from the secondary growth of the vascular tissues  however  they still reproduced like ferns  releasing spores into the environment
__label__1 seed ferns   link   produced their seeds along their branches without specialized structures
__label__1 what makes them the first true seed plants is that they developed structures called cupules to enclose and protect the ovule  the female gametophyte and associated tissues  which develops into a seed upon fertilization
__label__0 seed plants resembling modern tree ferns became more numerous and diverse in the coal swamps of the carboniferous period
__label__0 three cell divisions transform the single  celled zygote into an eight  celled structure
__label__1 after further cell division and rearrangement of existing cells  a celled hollow structure called a blastula is formed
__label__1 next  the blastula undergoes further cell division and cellular rearrangement during a process called gastrulation
__label__1 different cell layers  called germ layers  are formed during gastrulation
__label__1 these germ layers are programmed to develop into certain tissue types  organs  and organ systems during a process called organogenesis
__label__1 further subdivision of animals with three germ layers  triploblasts  results in the separation of animals that may develop an internal body cavity derived from mesoderm  called a coelom  and those that do not
__label__0 this epithelial cell  lined coelomic cavity represents a space  usually filled with fluid  which lies between the visceral organs and the body wall
__label__1 a third group of triploblasts has a slightly different coelom derived partly from mesoderm and partly from endoderm  which is found between the two layers
__label__0 although still functional  these are considered false coeloms  and those animals are called pseudocoelomates
__label__0 the phylum nematoda  roundworms  is an example of a pseudocoelomate
__label__0 the mouth or anus develops from a structure called the blastopore   link
__label__1 the blastopore is the indentation formed during the initial stages of gastrulation
__label__0 in later stages  a second opening forms  and these two openings will eventually give rise to the mouth and anus   link
__label__0 the earliest distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the type of cleavage undergone by the zygote
__label__1 protostomes undergo spiral cleavage  meaning that the cells of one pole of the embryo are rotated  and thus misaligned  with respect to the cells of the opposite pole
__label__0 this is due to the oblique angle of the cleavage
__label__0 a cell does not have the ability to develop into any cell type
__label__1 in contrast  deuterostomes undergo indeterminate cleavage  in which cells are not yet pre  determined at this early stage to develop into specific cell types
__label__0 these cells are referred to as undifferentiated cells
__label__1 ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods  they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group  exoskeletal molting  termed ecdysis
__label__1 lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features  each common to certain phyla within the clade
__label__0 some lophotrochozoan phyla are characterized by a larval stage called trochophore larvae  and other phyla are characterized by the presence of a feeding structure called a lophophore
__label__1 the cambrian explosion of animal lifethe cambrian period  occurring between approximately    million years ago  marks the most rapid evolution of new animal phyla and animal diversity in earth s history
__label__0 it is believed that most of the animal phyla in existence today had their origins during this time  often referred to as the cambrian explosion   link
__label__0 echinoderms  mollusks  worms  arthropods  and chordates arose during this period
__label__1 the invertebrates  or invertebrata  are animals that do not contain bony structures  such as the cranium and vertebrae
__label__1 the simplest of all the invertebrates are the parazoans  which include only the phylum porifera  the sponges   link
__label__1 parazoans   beside animals   do not display tissue  level organization  although they do have specialized cells that perform specific functions
__label__0 while sponges  excluding the hexactinellids  do not exhibit tissue  layer organization  they do have different cell types that perform distinct functions
__label__1 pinacocytes  which are epithelial  like cells  form the outermost layer of sponges and enclose a jelly  like substance called mesohyl
__label__1 mesohyl is an extracellular matrix consisting of a collagen  like gel with suspended cells that perform various functions
__label__1 in some sponges  ostia are formed by porocytes  single tube  shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into the spongocoel
__label__1 in other sponges  ostia are formed by folds in the body wall of the sponge  choanocytes   collar cells   are present at various locations  depending on the type of sponge  but they always line the inner portions of some space through which water flows  the spongocoel in simple sponges  canals within the body wall in more complex sponges  and chambers scattered throughout the body in the most complex sponges
__label__1 whereas pinacocytes line the outside of the sponge  choanocytes tend to line certain inner portions of the sponge body that surround the mesohyl
__label__0 an atypical type of asexual reproduction is found only in freshwater sponges and occurs through the formation of gemmules
__label__1 gemmules are environmentally resistant structures produced by adult sponges wherein the typical sponge morphology is inverted
__label__0 in gemmules  an inner layer of amoebocytes is surrounded by a layer of collagen  spongin  that may be reinforced by spicules
__label__0 animals in this phylum display two distinct morphological body plans  polyp or  stalk  and medusa or  bell    link
__label__0 an example of the polyp form is hydra spp
__label__1 the cnidarians perform extracellular digestion in which the food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity  enzymes are secreted into the cavity  and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients
__label__0 the gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus  which is termed an incomplete digestive system
__label__0 these forms may produce additional polyps by budding or may transform into the medusoid form
__label__0 the life cycle   link   of these animals can be described as polymorphic  because they exhibit both a medusal and polypoid body plan at some point in their life cycle
__label__0 rotifers obtain food that is directed toward the mouth by the current created from the movement of the corona
__label__1 the food particles enter the mouth and travel to the mastax  pharynx with jaw  like structures
__label__0 food then passes by digestive and salivary glands  and into the stomach  then onto the intestines
__label__0 eggs and sperm are released into the water  and fertilization occurs externally
__label__0 the zygote then develops into a planuliform larva
__label__0 in some nemertine species  a pilidium larva may develop inside the young worm  from a series of imaginal discs
__label__0 mollusk species that are exclusively aquatic have gills for respiration  whereas some terrestrial species have lungs for respiration
__label__1 additionally  a tongue  like organ called a radula  which bears chitinous tooth  like ornamentation  is present in many species  and serves to shred or scrape food
__label__1 the mantle  also known as the pallium  is the dorsal epidermis in mollusks  shelled mollusks are specialized to secrete a chitinous and hard calcareous shell
__label__0 calcareous spines may be present on the girdle to offer protection from predators
__label__0 respiration is facilitated by ctenidia  gills  that are present ventrally
__label__0 these animals possess a radula that is modified for scraping
__label__0 the head is rudimentary and protrudes out of the posterior end of the shell
__label__1 these animals do not possess eyes  but they have a radula  as well as a foot modified into tentacles with a bulbous end  known as captaculae
__label__0 captaculae serve to catch and manipulate prey
__label__1 the overall body can be divided into head  body  and pygidium  or tail
__label__1 the clitellum is a reproductive structure that generates mucus that aids in sperm transfer and gives rise to a cocoon within which fertilization occurs  it appears as a fused band in the anterior third of the animal   link
__label__1 the name derives from the word ecdysis  which refers to the shedding  or molting  of the exoskeleton
__label__1 the phyla in this group have a hard cuticle that covers their bodies  which must be periodically shed and replaced for them to increase in size  phylum nematoda includes more than  species with an estimated  being parasitic in nature
__label__1 the name nematoda is derived from the greek word  nemos   which means  thread  and includes roundworms
__label__1 crustaceans possess two pairs of antennae  mandibles as mouthparts  and biramous   two branched   appendages  which means that their legs are formed in two parts  as distinct from the uniramous   one branched   myriapods and hexapods   link
__label__0 larval stages  nauplius and zoea  are seen in the early development of crustaceans
__label__0 a cypris larva is also seen in the early development of barnacles   link
__label__0 these animals do not possess antennae
__label__1 the second pair of appendages is known as pedipalps
__label__0 in some species  like sea spiders  an additional pair of appendages  called ovigers  is present between the chelicerae and pedipalps
__label__0 these buds  known as coelomic pouches  fuse to form the coelomic cavity  as they eventually separate from the endodermal layer
__label__0 the resultant coelom is termed an enterocoelom
__label__0 the archenteron develops into the alimentary canal  and a mouth opening is formed by invagination of ectoderm at the pole opposite the blastopore of the gastrula
__label__1 podocytes  cells specialized for ultrafiltration of bodily fluids  are present near the center of echinoderms
__label__1 these podocytes are connected by an internal system of canals to an opening called the madreporite
__label__1 the chordates are named for the notochord  which is a flexible  rod  shaped structure that is found in the embryonic stage of all chordates and in the adult stage of some chordate species
__label__0 it is located between the digestive tube and the nerve cord  and provides skeletal support through the length of the body
__label__0 in tetrapods  the slits are modified into components of the ear and tonsils
__label__1 tetrapod literally means  four  footed   which refers to the phylogenetic history of various groups that evolved accordingly  even though some now possess fewer than two pairs of walking appendages
__label__0 tetrapods include amphibians  reptiles  birds  and mammals
__label__1 members of cephalochordata possess a notochord  dorsal hollow nerve cord  pharyngeal slits  and a post  anal tail in the adult stage   link

__label__1 amphibians are vertebrate tetrapods
__label__0 amphibia includes frogs  salamanders  and caecilians
__label__0 the term amphibian loosely translates from the greek as  dual life   which is a reference to the metamorphosis that many frogs and salamanders undergo and their mixture of aquatic and terrestrial environments in their life cycle
__label__0 amphibia comprises an estimated  extant species that inhabit tropical and temperate regions around the world
__label__1 amphibians can be divided into three clades  urodela   tailed  ones    the salamanders  anura   tail  less ones    the frogs  and apoda   legless ones    the caecilians
__label__1 the life cycle of frogs  as other amphibians  consists of two distinct stages  the larval stage followed by metamorphosis to an adult stage
__label__1 the larval stage of a frog  the tadpole  is often a filter  feeding herbivore
__label__0 tadpoles usually have gills  a lateral line system  long  finned tails  and lack limbs
__label__1 the chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the egg s external environment
__label__1 the amnion protects the embryo from mechanical shock and supports hydration

__label__1 synapsids also include therapsids  which were mammal  like reptiles from which mammals evolved
__label__1 sauropsids include reptiles and birds  and can be further divided into anapsids and diapsids
__label__0 the key differences between the synapsids  anapsids  and diapsids are the structures of the skull and the number of temporal fenestrae behind each eye   link
__label__1 the diapsids diverged into two groups  the archosauromorpha   ancient lizard form   and the lepidosauromorpha   scaly lizard form   during the mesozoic period   link

__label__1 sweat glands are located over most of the body surface in primates
__label__1 apocrine glands  or scent glands  secrete substances that are used for chemical communication  such as in skunks
__label__1 mammary glands produce milk that is used to feed newborns
__label__0 these allow side  to  side movement of the jaw  making chewing possible  which is unique to mammals
__label__1 most mammals have heterodont teeth  meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth rather than just one type and shape of tooth
__label__1 most mammals are diphyodonts  meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime  deciduous or  baby  teeth  and permanent teeth
__label__0 there are three living species of monotremes  the platypus and two species of echidnas  or spiny anteaters

__label__0 the platypus and one species of echidna are found in australia  and the other species of echidna is found in new guinea
__label__1 like mammals  which are also endothermic  birds have an insulating covering that keeps heat in the body  feathers
__label__1 specialized feathers called down feathers are especially insulating  trapping air in spaces between each feather to decrease the rate of heat loss
__label__0 certain parts of a bird s body are covered in down feathers  and the base of other feathers have a downy portion  whereas newly hatched birds are covered in down
__label__1 primary feathers are located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust
__label__1 secondary feathers are located closer to the body  attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift
__label__1 contour feathers are the feathers found on the body  and they help reduce drag produced by wind resistance during flight
__label__0 several modifications are found in birds to reduce body weight  including pneumatization of bones
__label__1 pneumatic bones are bones that are hollow  rather than filled with tissue   link
__label__0 they contain air spaces that are sometimes connected to air sacs  and they have struts of bone to provide structural reinforcement
__label__0 during the cretaceous period  a group known as the enantiornithes was the dominant bird type   link
__label__1 enantiornithes means  opposite birds   which refers to the fact that certain bones of the feet are joined differently than the way the bones are joined in modern birds
__label__0 all primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees  as they all descended from tree  dwellers
__label__1 this arboreal heritage of primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for brachiation  or climbing and swinging through trees
__label__1 these adaptations include  but are not limited to    a rotating shoulder joint    a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs  which are widely separated from fingers  except humans   which allow for gripping branches    stereoscopic vision  two overlapping fields of vision from the eyes  which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance
__label__1 prosimians include the bush babies of africa  the lemurs of madagascar  and the lorises  pottos  and tarsiers of southeast asia
__label__1 anthropoids include monkeys  apes  and humans
__label__0 in general  prosimians tend to be nocturnal  in contrast to diurnal anthropoids  and exhibit a smaller size and smaller brain than anthropoids
__label__1 new world monkeys are also called platyrrhini  a reference to their broad noses   link
__label__1 old world monkeys are called catarrhini  a reference to their narrow noses
__label__0 there is still quite a bit of uncertainty about the origins of the new world monkeys
__label__1 the family hominidae of order primates includes the hominoids  the great apes   link
__label__0 evidence from the fossil record and from a comparison of human and chimpanzee dna suggests that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common hominoid ancestor approximately  million years ago
__label__0 its brain size was    cubic centimeters  approximately the size of a modern chimpanzee brain
__label__0 it also had prognathic jaws  which is a relatively longer jaw than that of modern humans
__label__0 in the mids  the fossil of an adult female a afarensis was found in the afar region of ethiopia and dated to  million years ago   link
__label__1 the shoot system generally grows above ground  where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis
__label__1 the root system  which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals  is usually underground
__label__0 link  shows the organ systems of a typical plant
__label__1 meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated  and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant
__label__1 in contrast  permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing
__label__1 lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant
__label__1 intercalary meristems occur only in monocots  at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes  the areas where leaves attach to a stem
__label__1 this tissue enables the monocot leaf blade to increase in length from the leaf base  for example  it allows lawn grass leaves to elongate even after repeated mowing
__label__0 the xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other   link
__label__1 in stems  the xylem and the phloem form a structure called a vascular bundle  in roots  this is termed the vascular stele or vascular cylinder
__label__0 this light micrograph shows a cross section of a squash  curcurbita maxima  stem
__label__0 each teardrop  shaped vascular bundle consists of large xylem vessels toward the inside and smaller phloem cells toward the outside
__label__1 the stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole
__label__1 an axillary bud is usually found in the axil  the area between the base of a leaf and the stem  where it can give rise to a branch or a flower
__label__1 the apex  tip  of the shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud
__label__1 collenchyma cells are elongated cells with unevenly thickened walls   link
__label__0 they provide structural support  mainly to the stem and leaves
__label__1 the dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis  a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying tissue
__label__1 woody plants have a tough  waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark  which further protects the plant from damage
__label__1 epidermal cells are the most numerous and least differentiated of the cells in the epidermis
__label__1 trichomes are hair  like structures on the epidermal surface
__label__1 they help to reduce transpiration  the loss of water by aboveground plant parts   increase solar reflectance  and store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores
__label__1 openings called stomata  singular  stoma  allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and water vapor
__label__0 the  a  colorized scanning  electron micrograph shows a closed stoma of a dicot
__label__1 phloem tissue is composed of sieve  tube cells  companion cells  phloem parenchyma  and phloem fibers
__label__1 a series of sieve  tube cells  also called sieve  tube elements  are arranged end to end to make up a long sieve tube  which transports organic substances such as sugars and amino acids
__label__0 the sugars flow from one sieve  tube cell to the next through perforated sieve plates  which are found at the end junctions between two cells
__label__0 some plants  especially those that are woody  also increase in thickness during their life span
__label__1 the increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth  and is the result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem
__label__1 secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant  and is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem
__label__0 the periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants
__label__1 in some plants  the periderm has many openings  known as lenticels  which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the outside atmosphere   link
__label__0 this supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active cells of the cortex  xylem and phloem
__label__1 corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter
__label__1 stolons are stems that run almost parallel to the ground  or just below the surface  and can give rise to new plants at the nodes
__label__1 runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals  strawberries are an example
__label__1 tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons  and contain many adventitious or unusual buds  familiar to us as the  eyes  on potatoes
__label__1 a bulb  which functions as an underground storage unit  is a modification of a stem that has the appearance of enlarged fleshy leaves emerging from the stem or surrounding the base of the stem  as seen in the iris
__label__0 most roots are underground
__label__1 some plants  however  also have adventitious roots  which emerge above the ground from the shoot
__label__0 when the plant embryo emerges from the seed  the radicle of the embryo forms the root system
__label__1 the tip of the root is protected by the root cap  a structure exclusive to roots and unlike any other plant structure
__label__0 the root cap is continuously replaced because it gets damaged easily as the root pushes through soil
__label__1 the vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root  which is called the stele   link
__label__1 a layer of cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root
__label__0 the endodermis is exclusive to roots  and serves as a checkpoint for materials entering the root s vascular system
__label__1 each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina  which is also the widest part of the leaf
__label__0 some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole
__label__1 leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves
__label__1 small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules
__label__1 most leaves have a midrib  which travels the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue
__label__0 in an opposite leaf arrangement  two leaves arise at the same point  with the leaves connecting opposite each other along the branch
__label__1 if there are three or more leaves connected at a node  the leaf arrangement is classified as whorled
__label__0 each leaflet may have its own stalk  but is attached to the rachis
__label__1 a palmately compound leaf resembles the palm of a hand  with leaflets radiating outwards from one point examples include the leaves of poison ivy  the buckeye tree  or the familiar houseplant schefflera sp
__label__0 common name  umbrella plant
__label__1 water potential is a measure of the potential energy in water
__label__0 plant physiologists are not interested in the energy in any one particular aqueous system  but are very interested in water movement between two systems
__label__1 transpiration  the loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through stomata  is a passive process  meaning that metabolic energy in the form of atp is not required for water movement
__label__0 the energy driving transpiration is the difference in energy between the water in the soil and the water in the atmosphere
__label__1 structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources
__label__0 sugars produced in sources  such as leaves  need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation
__label__1 the points of sugar delivery  such as roots  young shoots  and developing seeds  are called sinks
__label__0 it allows plants to optimize their use of light and space
__label__1 photoperiodism is the ability to use light to track time
__label__0 plants can tell the time of day and time of year by sensing and using various wavelengths of sunlight
__label__1 the phytochromes are a family of chromoproteins with a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore  similar to the ringed tetrapyrrole light  absorbing head group of chlorophyll
__label__0 phytochromes have two photo  interconvertible forms  pr and pfr
__label__1 gravitropism ensures that roots grow into the soil and that shoots grow toward sunlight
__label__1 growth of the shoot apical tip upward is called negative gravitropism  whereas growth of the roots downward is called positive gravitropism
__label__1 apical dominance  the inhibition of lateral bud formation  is triggered by auxins produced in the apical meristem
__label__1 flowering  fruit setting and ripening  and inhibition of abscission  leaf falling  are other plant responses under the direct or indirect control of auxins
__label__0 auxins also act as a relay for the effects of the blue light and red  far  red responses
__label__1 the plant hormone abscisic acid  aba  was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping of cotton bolls
__label__0 however  more recent studies indicate that aba plays only a minor role in the abscission process
__label__1 oligosaccharins also play a role in plant defense against bacterial and fungal infections
__label__0 they act locally at the site of injury  and can also be transported to other tissues
__label__0 cells in contact with a support surface contract  whereas cells on the opposite side of the support expand   link
__label__0 application of jasmonic acid is sufficient to trigger tendril coiling without a mechanical stimulus
__label__1 a thigmonastic response is a touch response independent of the direction of stimulus  link
__label__0 in the venus flytrap  two modified leaves are joined at a hinge and lined with thin fork  like tines along the outer edges
__label__0 carbon that was obtained from atmospheric co composes the majority of the dry mass within most plants
__label__0 an inorganic compound does not contain carbon and is not part of  or produced by  a living organism
__label__1 inorganic substances  which form the majority of the soil solution  are commonly called minerals  those required by plants include nitrogen  n  and potassium  k  for structure and regulation
__label__0 in addition to macronutrients  organisms require various elements in small amounts
__label__0 these micronutrients  or trace elements  are present in very small quantities
__label__0 they include boron  b   chlorine  cl   manganese  mn   iron  fe   zinc  zn   copper  cu   molybdenum  mo   nickel  ni   silicon  si   and sodium  na
__label__1 the organic material of soil  called humus  is made up of microorganisms  dead and alive   and dead animals and plants in varying stages of decay
__label__0 link  shows a way of graphing the exchange of a virtual photon between two positive charges
__label__1 this graph of time versus position is called a feynman diagram  after the brilliant american physicist richard feynman      who developed it
__label__0 link  is a feynman diagram for the exchange of a virtual pion between a proton and a neutron representing the same interaction as in  link
__label__0 feynman diagrams are not only a useful tool for visualizing interactions at the quantum mechanical level  they are also used to calculate details of interactions  such as their strengths and probability of occurring
__label__0 special names are given to particles that feel the strong and weak nuclear forces
__label__1 hadrons are particles that feel the strong nuclear force  whereas leptons are particles that do not
__label__0 the proton  neutron  and the pions are examples of hadrons
__label__1 mesons are hadrons that can decay to leptons and leave no hadrons  which implies that mesons are not conserved in number
__label__1 baryons are hadrons that always decay to another baryon
__label__0 a new physical quantity called baryon number b b size   b    seems to always be conserved in nature and is listed for the various particles in the table given above
__label__0 keep in mind that all leptons seem to be fundamental  whereasno hadrons are fundamental
__label__1 there is strong evidence that quarks are the fundamental building blocks of hadrons as seen in  link
__label__0 quarks are the second group of fundamental particles  leptons are the first
__label__0 when a combination of quarks has color other than white  it exerts extremely large forces  even larger than the strong force  and perhaps can not be stable or permanently separated
__label__1 this is part of the theory of quark confinement  which explains how quarks can exist and yet never be isolated or directly observed
__label__0 finally  an extra quantum number with three values  like those we assign to color  is necessary for quarks to obey the pauli exclusion principle
__label__0 frontiers of physics expands the story in making a connection with cosmology  on the opposite end of the distance scale
__label__0 link  is a feynman diagram showing how the weak nuclear force is transmitted by the carrier particle z z size   z rsup  size          similar to the diagrams in  link  and  link  for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces
__label__1 in the s  a gauge theory  called electroweak theory  was developed by steven weinberg  sheldon glashow  and abdus salam and proposed that the electromagnetic and weak forces are identical at sufficiently high energies
__label__0 one of its predictions  in addition to describing both electromagnetic and weak force phenomena  was the existence of the w  w w  w  and z z carrier particles
__label__0 in fact  there is enough energy when things are pushed to even smaller distances to transform the  and z z size   z rsup  size         into massless carrier particles more similar to photons and gluons
__label__0 these have not been observed experimentally  but there is a prediction of an associated particle called the higgs boson
__label__0 the mass of this particle is not predicted with nearly the certainty with which the mass of the w  w  w  w  and z z size   z rsup  size         particles were predicted  but it was hoped that the higgs boson could be observed at the now  canceled superconducting super collider  ssc
__label__0 perhaps the most important characteristic of the universe is that all galaxies except those in our local cluster seem to be moving away from us at speeds proportional to their distance from our galaxy
__label__1 it looks as if a gigantic explosion  universally called the big bang  threw matter out some billions of years ago
__label__0 this amazing conclusion is based on the pioneering work of edwin hubble     the american astronomer
__label__0 at   s   s size
__label__0 before that time is the toe epoch  but we have almost no idea as to the nature of the universe then  since we have no workable theory of quantum gravity
__label__1 we call the hypothetical unified force superforce  now let us imagine starting at toe and moving forward in time to see what type of universe is created from various events along the way
__label__1 we know from special relativity that relativity is the study of how different observers measure the same event  particularly if they move relative to one another
__label__1 einstein s theory of general relativity describes all types of relative motion including accelerated motion and the effects of gravity
__label__1 general relativity encompasses special relativity and classical relativity in situations where acceleration is zero and relative velocity is small compared with the speed of light
__label__1 black holesblack holes are objects having such large gravitational fields that things can fall in  but nothing  not even light  can escape
__label__0 bodies  like the earth or the sun  have what is called an escape velocity
__label__0 these objects were first discovered in  by the british astrophysicists  jocelyn bell and anthony hewish
__label__1 neutron stars are literally a star composed of neutrons
__label__0 they are formed by the collapse of a star s core in a supernova  during which electrons and protons are forced together to form neutrons  the reverse of neutron   size       decay
__label__1 introduced earlier in guts  the unification of forces superstring theory is an attempt to unify gravity with the other three forces and  thus  must contain quantum gravity
__label__0 the main tenet of superstring theory is that fundamental particles  including the graviton that carries the gravitational force  act like one  dimensional vibrating strings
__label__0 finally  the most recent measurements of the cmbr have implications for the cosmological constant  so it is not simply a device concocted for a single purpose  after the recent experimental discovery of the cosmological constant  most researchers feel that the universe should be just barely open
__label__0 since matter can be thought to curve the space around it  we call an open universe negatively curved
__label__1 this means that you can in principle travel an unlimited distance in any direction
__label__0 the question is open as to how many planets or other bodies smaller than about  the mass of the sun are there
__label__0 if such bodies pass between us and a star  they will not block the star s light  being too small  but they will form a gravitational lens  as discussed in general relativity and quantum gravity
__label__1 in a process called microlensing  light from the star is focused and the star appears to brighten in a characteristic manner
__label__0 searches for dark matter in this form are particularly interested in galactic halos because of the huge amount of mass that seems to be there
__label__0 the most radical proposal to explain dark matter is that it consists of previously unknown leptons  sometimes obtusely referred to as non  baryonic matter
__label__1 these are called weakly interacting massive particles  or wimps  and would also be chargeless  thus interacting negligibly with normal matter  except through gravitation
__label__1 one proposed group of wimps would have masses several orders of magnitude greater than nucleons and are sometimes called neutralinos
__label__0 it is also based partly in physics and treats broad classes of phenomena from many disciplines
__label__1 chaos is a word used to describe systems whose outcomes are extremely sensitive to initial conditions
__label__0 the orbit of the planet pluto  for example  may be chaotic in that it can change tremendously due to small interactions with other planets
__label__0 for example  if you ride a train past a stationary warning bell  you will hear the bell s frequency shift from high to low as you pass by
__label__1 the actual change in frequency due to relative motion of source and observer is called a doppler shift
__label__0 the doppler effect and doppler shift are named for the austrian physicist and mathematician christian johann doppler       who did experiments with both moving sources and moving observers
__label__0 power is associated by many people with electricity
__label__1 knowing that power is the rate of energy use or energy conversion  what is the expression for electric power
__label__0 power transmission lines might come to mind
__label__0 lawrence was involved in many early discoveries and in the promotion of physics programs in american universities
__label__0 he was awarded the  nobel prize in physics for the cyclotron and nuclear activations  and he has an element and two major laboratories named for him
__label__1 a synchrotron is a version of a cyclotron in which the frequency of the alternating voltage and the magnetic field strength are increased as the beam particles are accelerated
__label__0 particles are made to travel the same distance in a shorter time with each cycle in fixed  radius orbits
__label__0 its cost as well as the politics of international research funding led to its demise
__label__0 in addition to the large synchrotrons that produce colliding beams of protons and antiprotons  there are other large electron  positron accelerators
__label__1 the oldest of these was a straight  line or linear accelerator  called the stanford linear accelerator  slac   which accelerated particles up to  gev as seen in  link
__label__0 within the soil profile  soil scientists define zones called horizons
__label__1 a horizon is a soil layer with distinct physical and chemical properties that differ from those of other layers
__label__0 five factors account for soil formation  parent material  climate  topography  biological factors  and time  parent material
__label__0 animals and microorganisms can produce pores and crevices  and plant roots can penetrate into crevices to produce more fragmentation
__label__1 plant secretions promote the development of microorganisms around the root  in an area known as the rhizosphere
__label__0 additionally  leaves and other material that fall from plants decompose and contribute to soil composition
__label__0 in this area  rainwater percolates through the soil and carries materials from the surface
__label__1 the b horizon is an accumulation of mostly fine material that has moved downward  resulting in a dense layer in the soil
__label__0 in some soils  the b horizon contains nodules or a layer of calcium carbonate
__label__1 soil bacteria  collectively called rhizobia  symbiotically interact with legume roots to form specialized structures called nodules  in which nitrogen fixation takes place
__label__0 this process entails the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia  by means of the enzyme nitrogenase
__label__0 therefore  using rhizobia is a natural and environmentally friendly way to fertilize plants  as opposed to chemical fertilization that uses a nonrenewable resource  such as natural gas
__label__1 a symbiont is a plant in a symbiotic relationship  with special adaptations such as mycorrhizae or nodule formation
__label__1 fungi also form symbiotic associations with cyanobacteria and green algae  called lichens
__label__0 plants have two distinct stages in their lifecycle  the gametophyte stage and the sporophyte stage
__label__1 the haploid gametophyte produces the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures
__label__1 fusion of the male and females gametes forms the diploid zygote  which develops into the sporophyte
__label__0 the third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium
__label__1 the androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia
__label__1 the innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium  or the female reproductive components
__label__0 each pollen grain has two coverings  the exine  thicker  outer layer  and the intine   link
__label__1 the exine contains sporopollenin  a complex waterproofing substance supplied by the tapetal cells
__label__1 during the second phase  megagametogenesis  the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight  nucleate  seven  cell female gametophyte  also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac
__label__1 during the second phase  megagametogenesis  the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight  nucleate  seven  cell female gametophyte  also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac
__label__0 two of the nuclei  the polar nuclei  move to the equator and fuse  forming a single  diploid central cell
__label__0 this central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm
__label__0 the ovule wall will become part of the fruit
__label__0 the integuments  while protecting the megasporangium  do not enclose it completely  but leave an opening called the micropyle
__label__1 the micropyle allows the pollen tube to enter the female gametophyte for fertilization
__label__1 in angiosperms  pollination is defined as the placement or transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower
__label__1 in gymnosperms  pollination involves pollen transfer from the male cone to the female cone
__label__0 they visit flowers that are open during the day  are brightly colored  have a strong aroma or scent  and have a tubular shape  typically with the presence of a nectar guide
__label__1 a nectar guide includes regions on the flower petals that are visible only to bees  and not to humans  it helps to guide bees to the center of the flower  thus making the pollination process more efficient
__label__0 the pollen sticks to the bees  fuzzy hair  and when the bee visits another flower  some of the pollen is transferred to the second flower
__label__0 after fertilization  the zygote divides to form two cells  the upper cell  or terminal cell  and the lower  or basal  cell
__label__0 the division of the basal cell gives rise to the suspensor  which eventually makes connection with the maternal tissue
__label__1 the suspensor provides a route for nutrition to be transported from the mother plant to the growing embryo
__label__0 food reserves are stored in the large endosperm
__label__1 upon germination  enzymes are secreted by the aleurone  a single layer of cells just inside the seed coat that surrounds the endosperm and embryo
__label__0 the enzymes degrade the stored carbohydrates  proteins and lipids  the products of which are absorbed by the scutellum and transported via a vasculature strand to the developing embryo
__label__0 the seed  along with the ovule  is protected by a seed coat that is formed from the integuments of the ovule sac
__label__1 in dicots  the seed coat is further divided into an outer coat known as the testa and inner coat known as the tegmen
__label__0 in monocots  the hypocotyl does not show above ground because monocots do not exhibit stem elongation
__label__1 the part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the epicotyl
__label__1 the plumule is composed of the epicotyl  young leaves  and the shoot apical meristem  upon germination in dicot seeds  the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards
__label__0 in many seeds  the presence of a thick seed coat retards the ability to germinate
__label__1 scarification  which includes mechanical or chemical processes to soften the seed coat  is often employed before germination
__label__0 presoaking in hot water  or passing through an acid environment  such as an animal s digestive tract  may also be employed
__label__1 an aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel  but all are in the same flower  the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit  as seen in the raspberry
__label__1 multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers
__label__0 an example is the pineapple  where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit
__label__1 fruits generally have three parts  the exocarp  the outermost skin or covering   the mesocarp  middle part of the fruit   and the endocarp  the inner part of the fruit
__label__1 fruits generally have three parts  the exocarp  the outermost skin or covering   the mesocarp  middle part of the fruit   and the endocarp  the inner part of the fruit
__label__0 together  all three are known as the pericarp
__label__0 the mesocarp is usually the fleshy  edible part of the fruit  however  in some fruits  such as the almond  the endocarp is the edible part
__label__1 in grafting  two plant species are used  part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock
__label__1 the part that is grafted or attached is called the scion
__label__1 both are cut at an oblique angle  any angle other than a right angle   placed in close contact with each other  and are then held together  link
__label__1 micropropagation  also called plant tissue culture  is a method of propagating a large number of plants from a single plant in a short time under laboratory conditions  link
__label__0 this method allows propagation of rare  endangered species that may be difficult to grow under natural conditions  are economically important  or are in demand as disease  free plants
__label__1 the aging of a plant and all the associated processes is known as senescence  which is marked by several complex biochemical changes
__label__0 one of the characteristics of senescence is the breakdown of chloroplasts  which is characterized by the yellowing of leaves
__label__0 this is fused to the animal s epidermis
__label__1 ingrowths of the exoskeleton  called apodemes  function as attachment sites for muscles  similar to tendons in more advanced animals   link
__label__0 in order to grow  the animal must first synthesize a new exoskeleton underneath the old one and then shed or molt the original covering
__label__0 carbohydrates and proteins contain about  to  kcal  g  and fat contains about  kcal  g
__label__1 metabolic rate is estimated as the basal metabolic rate  bmr  in endothermic animals at rest and as the standard metabolic rate  smr  in ectotherms
__label__0 human males have a bmr of  to  kcal  day  and human females have a bmr of  to  kcal  day
__label__0 torpor can be used by animals for long periods  such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months  in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature
__label__0 during hibernation  ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of   c    f   while a bear s internal temperature is maintained higher at about   c    f
__label__1 if torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water  it is called estivation
__label__0 some desert animals use this to survive the harshest months of the year
__label__1 a midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle  making two equal right and left halves
__label__1 a frontal plane  also called a coronal plane  separates the front from the back
__label__1 a transverse plane  or  horizontal plane  divides the animal into upper and lower portions
__label__1 the dorsal cavity contains the cranial and the vertebral  or spinal  cavities
__label__1 the ventral cavity contains the thoracic cavity  which in turn contains the pleural cavity around the lungs and the pericardial cavity  which surrounds the heart
__label__0 the ventral cavity also contains the abdominopelvic cavity  which can be separated into the abdominal and the pelvic cavities
__label__0 squamous epithelial cells are generally round  flat  and have a small  centrally located nucleus
__label__0 the cell outline is slightly irregular  and cells fit together to form a covering or lining
__label__1 the nuclei are arranged at different levels in the layer of cells  making it appear as though there is more than one layer  as seen in  link
__label__0 this is called pseudostratified  columnar epithelia
__label__1 this cellular covering has cilia at the apical  or free  surface of the cells
__label__0 some tissues have specialized cells that are not found in the others
__label__0 the matrix in connective tissues gives the tissue its density
__label__0 when a connective tissue has a high concentration of cells or fibers  it has proportionally a less dense matrix
__label__1 cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers
__label__1 the cells  called chondrocytes  make the matrix and fibers of the tissue
__label__1 compact bone is found in the shaft  or diaphysis  of a long bone and the surface of the flat bones  while spongy bone is found in the end  or epiphysis  of a long bone
__label__1 compact bone is organized into subunits called osteons  as illustrated in  link
__label__1 a blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within the haversian canal  with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae
__label__0 these changes might be in the level of glucose or calcium in blood or in external temperatures
__label__1 homeostasis means to maintain dynamic equilibrium in the body
__label__0 it is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the changes that the body s systems encounter
__label__0 positive feedback loop
__label__1 a positive feedback loop maintains the direction of the stimulus  possibly accelerating it
__label__1 few examples of positive feedback loops exist in animal bodies  but one is found in the cascade of chemical reactions that result in blood clotting  or coagulation
__label__1 omnivores are animals that eat both plant and animal derived food
__label__0 in latin  omnivore means to eat everything
__label__1 as the word monogastric suggests  this type of digestive system consists of one   mono   stomach chamber   gastric
__label__0 humans and many animals have a monogastric digestive system as illustrated in  link  a b
__label__0 saliva also contains immunoglobulins and lysozymes  which have antibacterial action to reduce tooth decay by inhibiting growth of some bacteria
__label__1 saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose
__label__0 another enzyme called lipase is produced by the cells in the tongue
__label__1 the esophagus is a tubular organ that connects the mouth to the stomach
__label__0 the chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed
__label__1 the large intestine  illustrated in  link   reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the waste material
__label__0 the human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter
__label__1 the liver is the largest internal organ in humans and it plays a very important role in digestion of fats and detoxifying blood
__label__1 the liver produces bile  a digestive juice that is required for the breakdown of fatty components of the food in the duodenum
__label__1 essential nutrientswhile the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from the organic precursors  there are some nutrients that need to be consumed from food
__label__0 these nutrients are termed essential nutrients  meaning they must be eaten  and the body can not produce them
__label__0 food needs to be broken into smaller particles so that animals can harness the nutrients and organic molecules
__label__0 the first step in this process is ingestion
__label__1 ingestion is the process of taking in food through the mouth
__label__1 the enzyme pepsin plays an important role in the digestion of proteins by breaking down the intact protein to peptides  which are short chains of four to nine amino acids
__label__0 in the duodenum  other enzymes  trypsin  elastase  and chymotrypsin  act on the peptides reducing them to smaller peptides
__label__0 trypsin elastase  carboxypeptidase  and chymotrypsin are produced by the pancreas and released into the duodenum where they act on the chyme
__label__0 the response to food begins even before food enters the mouth
__label__1 the first phase of ingestion  called the cephalic phase  is controlled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food
__label__0 all aspects  such as sight  sense  and smell  trigger the neural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices
__label__1 the endocrine system controls the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at the appropriate times
__label__0 in the duodenum  digestive secretions from the liver  pancreas  and gallbladder play an important role in digesting chyme during the intestinal phase
__label__1 in order to neutralize the acidic chyme  a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum
__label__0 secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called cholecystokinin  cck
__label__1 the nervous system is made up of neurons  specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals  and glia  cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary to neurons
__label__1 the nervous system is made up of neurons  specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals  and glia  cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary to neurons
__label__0 a neuron can be compared to an electrical wire  it transmits a signal from one place to another
__label__1 the cell body contains a specialized structure  the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon
__label__1 an axon is a tube  like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals
__label__0 these terminals in turn synapse on other neurons  muscle  or target organs
__label__0 there are several different types of glia with different functions  two of which are shown in  link
__label__1 astrocytes  shown in  linka make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the cns
__label__0 they provide nutrients and other substances to neurons  regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid  and provide structural support for synapses
__label__1 microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms
__label__1 oligodendrocytes  shown in  linkb form myelin sheaths around axons in the cns
__label__0 one axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes  and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons
__label__0 radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations
__label__1 ependymal cells line fluid  filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord
__label__0 they are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid  which serves as a cushion for the brain  moves the fluid between the spinal cord and the brain  and is a component for the choroid plexus
__label__0 glial cells support neurons and maintain their environment
__label__0 when neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron s dendrites  ion channels open
__label__0 at excitatory synapses  this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the membrane  a decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron
__label__0 a stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential   mv
__label__1 flow of ions through these channels  particularly the na channels  regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon
__label__0 this  jumping  of the action potential from one node to the next is called saltatory conduction
__label__0 if nodes of ranvier were not present along an axon  the action potential would propagate very slowly since na and k channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials at every point along the axon instead of at specific points
__label__1 na enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize
__label__0 this depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential  epsp  and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential
__label__1 release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials  ipsps   a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane
__label__1 long  term potentiation  ltp  is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection
__label__0 ltp is based on the hebbian principle  cells that fire together wire together
__label__1 the central nervous system  cns  is made up of the brain  a part of which is shown in  link  and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges  from the greek word for membrane
__label__0 the outermost layer is the dura mater  latin for  hard mother
__label__1 as the latin suggests  the primary function for this thick layer is to protect the brain and spinal cord
__label__1 the last layer is the pia mater  latin for  soft mother    which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap
__label__0 the space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid  csf
__label__0 csf is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in fluid  filled compartments in the cns called ventricles
__label__0 the cortex is made up of two hemispheres  right and left  which are separated by a large sulcus
__label__1 a thick fiber bundle called the corpus callosum  latin   tough body   connects the two hemispheres and allows information to be passed from one side to the other
__label__0 although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other  the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant
__label__0 neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading
__label__0 two of the parietal lobe s main functions are processing somatosensation  touch sensations like pressure  pain  heat  cold  and processing proprioception  the sense of how parts of the body are oriented in space
__label__0 the parietal lobe contains a somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex
__label__1 the temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds
__label__1 it also contains the hippocampus  greek for  seahorse    a structure that processes memory formation
__label__0 the hippocampus is illustrated in  link
__label__0 below the thalamus is the hypothalamus  shown in  link
__label__1 the hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by sending signals to the pituitary gland  a pea  sized endocrine gland that releases several different hormones that affect other glands as well as other cells
__label__1 the hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by sending signals to the pituitary gland  a pea  sized endocrine gland that releases several different hormones that affect other glands as well as other cells
__label__0 the two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces
__label__1 the cingulate gyrus helps regulate emotions and pain
__label__0 connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord  shown in  link
__label__1 the spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and from the brain to the body
__label__0 most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 the axons of these neurons release acetylcholine on postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia  the sympathetic ganglia form a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord
__label__0 the acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons
__label__1 humans have  cranial nerves  nerves that emerge from or enter the skull  cranium   as opposed to the spinal nerves  which emerge from the vertebral column
__label__1 humans have  cranial nerves  nerves that emerge from or enter the skull  cranium   as opposed to the spinal nerves  which emerge from the vertebral column
__label__0 each cranial nerve is accorded a name  which are detailed in  link
__label__0 alzheimer s disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly
__label__0 in   an estimated  million americans suffered from alzheimer s disease  and payments for their care are estimated at   billion
__label__0 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  adhd
__label__0 approximately three to five percent of children and adults are affected by attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder  adhd
__label__0 like asd  adhd is more prevalent in males than females
__label__0 estimates suggest that up to three percent of people in the united states will be diagnosed with epilepsy in their lifetime
__label__0 while there are several different types of epilepsy  all are characterized by recurrent seizures
__label__0 this process is called sensory transduction  there are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction
__label__0 in one  a neuron works with a sensory receptor  a cell  or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus
__label__0 stimulation of the sensory receptor activates the associated afferent neuron  which carries information about the stimulus to the central nervous system
__label__0 the most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system
__label__1 this takes place at the sensory receptor  and the change in electrical potential that is produced is called the receptor potential
__label__0 how is sensory input  such as pressure on the skin  changed to a receptor potential
__label__1 mechanoreceptors in the skin are described as encapsulated  that is  surrounded by a capsule  or unencapsulated  a group that includes free nerve endings
__label__1 a free nerve ending  as its name implies  is an unencapsulated dendrite of a sensory neuron
__label__0 free nerve endings are the most common nerve endings in skin  and they extend into the middle of the epidermis
__label__0 deeper in the epidermis  near the base  are ruffini endings  which are also known as bulbous corpuscles
__label__0 they are found in both glabrous and hairy skin
__label__0 once in the medulla  the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus
__label__0 muscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch  or lengthening of muscles
__label__1 related to these are golgi tendon organs  which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction
__label__0 proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals come from limbs
__label__0 dogs detect up to about  hz  cats   hz  bats   hz  and dolphins  hz  and american shad  alosa sapidissima   a fish  can hear  hz
__label__1 those frequencies above the human range are called ultrasound  amplitude  or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough  in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated in  link
__label__0 the sound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds
__label__0 interior to the tympanum is the middle ear
__label__1 the middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles  which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear
__label__0 the three ossicles are the malleus  also known as the hammer   the incus  the anvil   and stapes  the stirrup
__label__1 the stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window  which is the outermost structure of the inner ear
__label__1 the structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth  a bony  hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear
__label__0 here  the energy from the sound wave is transferred from the stapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea
__label__0 when the sound waves in the cochlear fluid contact the basilar membrane  it flexes back and forth in a wave  like fashion
__label__0 above the basilar membrane is the tectorial membrane
__label__0 the fluid  filled semicircular canals are tubular loops set at oblique angles
__label__0 they are arranged in three spatial planes
__label__1 the photoreceptive cells of the eye  where transduction of light to nervous impulses occurs  are located in the retina  shown in  link   on the inner surface of the back of the eye
__label__0 but light does not impinge on the retina unaltered
__label__0 the lens is operated by muscles that stretch it flat or allow it to thicken  changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus it sharply on the retina
__label__0 with age comes the loss of the flexibility of the lens  and a form of farsightedness called presbyopia results
__label__0 presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina
__label__0 there are two types of photoreceptors in the retina  rods and cones  named for their general appearance as illustrated in  link
__label__1 rods are strongly photosensitive and are located in the outer edges of the retina
__label__0 photoreceptors in the retina continuously undergo tonic activity
__label__1 that is  they are always slightly active even when not stimulated by light
__label__0 finally  there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus  scn  of the hypothalamus
__label__1 the scn is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body s internal clock  which controls our circadian  day  long  cycle
__label__0 the scn sends information to the pineal gland  which is important in sleep  wake patterns and annual cycles
__label__1 odorants  odor molecules  enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium  the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity  as illustrated in  link
__label__1 the olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about  cm in humans
__label__1 olfactory neurons are bipolar neurons  neurons with two processes from the cell body
__label__0 each neuron has a single dendrite buried in the olfactory epithelium  and extending from this dendrite are  to  receptor  laden  hair  like cilia that trap odorant molecules
__label__0 these are elongated cells with hair  like processes called microvilli at the tips that extend into the taste bud pore  illustrate in  link
__label__1 food molecules  tastants  are dissolved in saliva  and they bind with and stimulate the receptors on the microvilli
__label__0 the receptors for tastants are located across the outer portion and front of the tongue  outside of the middle area where the filiform papillae are most prominent
__label__0 chemically  these hormones are usually ketones or alcohols  their chemical names will end in  ol  for alcohols or  one  for ketones
__label__1 examples of steroid hormones include estradiol  which is an estrogen  or female sex hormone  and testosterone  which is an androgen  or male sex hormone
__label__0 these two hormones are released by the female and male reproductive organs  respectively
__label__0 hormones mediate changes in target cells by binding to specific hormone receptors
__label__0 in this way  even though hormones circulate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types  they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors
__label__0 receptor binding alters cellular activity and results in an increase or decrease in normal body processes
__label__0 depending on the location of the protein receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone  hormones can mediate changes directly by binding to intracellular hormone receptors and modulating gene transcription  or indirectly by binding to cell surface receptors and stimulating signaling pathways
__label__0 one very important second messenger is cyclic amp  camp
__label__1 when a hormone binds to its membrane receptor  a g  protein that is associated with the receptor is activated  g  proteins are proteins separate from receptors that are found in the cell membrane
__label__0 when a hormone is not bound to the receptor  the g  protein is inactive and is bound to guanosine diphosphate  or gdp
__label__1 the term  humoral  is derived from the term  humor   which refers to bodily fluids such as blood
__label__1 a humoral stimulus refers to the control of hormone release in response to changes in extracellular fluids such as blood or the ion concentration in the blood
__label__0 for example  a rise in blood glucose levels triggers the pancreatic release of insulin
__label__0 because the neurons can regulate the release of hormones  the nervous and endocrine systems work in a coordinated manner to regulate the body s physiology
__label__0 hypothalamic  pituitary axisthe hypothalamus in vertebrates integrates the endocrine and nervous systems
__label__1 the hypothalamus is an endocrine organ located in the diencephalon of the brain
__label__1 the anterior pituitary gland  or adenohypophysis  is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus  down along the infundibulum  and to the anterior pituitary
__label__1 this capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system
__label__0 the thyroid gland is located in the neck  just below the larynx and in front of the trachea  as shown in  link
__label__0 it is a butterfly  shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus
__label__0 follicle cells are stimulated to release stored t and t by thyroid stimulating hormone  tsh   which is produced by the anterior pituitary
__label__0 these thyroid hormones increase the rates of mitochondrial atp production
__label__0 a third hormone  calcitonin  is produced by parafollicular cells of the thyroid either releasing hormones or inhibiting hormones
__label__0 rather  we do not have to
__label__0 the reason why is something called the division and specialization of labor  a production innovation first put forth by adam smith   link   in his book  the wealth of nations
__label__0 adam smithadam smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks
__label__0 first  specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage
__label__0 in later chapters  we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage
__label__0 people have different skills  talents  and interests  so they will be better at some jobs than at others
__label__0 john maynard keynes       one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century  pointed out that economics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking
__label__0 keynes  shown in  link   famously wrote in the introduction to a fellow economist s book    economics  is a method rather than a doctrine  an apparatus of the mind  a technique of thinking  which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions
__label__0 in other words  economics teaches you how to think  not what to think
__label__0 in a market economy  decision  making is decentralized
__label__1 market economies are based on private enterprise  the means of production  resources and businesses  are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals
__label__0 businesses supply goods and services based on demand
__label__0 it shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was exported for a selection of countries from  to   according to an entity known as the world bank
__label__1 exports are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad
__label__1 imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically
__label__0 burgers cost   each  and bus tickets are  cents each
__label__1 link  shows alphonso s budget constraint  that is  the outer boundary of his opportunity set
__label__1 the opportunity set identifies all the opportunities for spending within his budget
__label__0 these decisions do not look back to past choices
__label__1 thus  the budget constraint framework assumes that sunk costs  which are costs that were incurred in the past and can not be recovered  should not affect the current decision
__label__1 productive efficiency means that  given the available inputs and technology  it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good
__label__0 all choices on the ppf in  link   including a  b  c  d  and f  display productive efficiency
__label__1 when a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country  we say that this country has a comparative advantage in that good
__label__0 in our example  brazil has a comparative advantage in sugar cane and the us has a comparative advantage in wheat
__label__0 the first theme is scarcity
__label__0 it is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods
__label__0 both the demand and supply curve show the relationship between price and the number of units demanded or supplied
__label__1 price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded  qd  or supplied  qs  and the corresponding percent change in price
__label__1 the price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price
__label__1 the price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price  elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories  elastic  inelastic  and unitary
__label__1 an elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one  indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price
__label__1 elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply
__label__0 then  those values can be used to determine the price elasticity of demand  price elasticity of demand   change in quantity  change in price
__label__0 price elasticity of demand   change in quantity  change in price
__label__0 therefore  the elasticity of demand from g to h
__label__0 the magnitude of the elasticity has increased  in absolute value  as we moved up along the demand curve from points a to b
__label__0 recall that the elasticity between these two points was
__label__1 infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded  qd  or supplied  qs  changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all
__label__0 in both cases  the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in  link
__label__0 while perfectly elastic supply curves are unrealistic  goods with readily available inputs and whose production can be easily expanded will feature highly elastic supply curves
__label__0 however  in some cases  the price of a key input over which the firm has no control may rise
__label__0 for example  many chemical companies use petroleum as a key input  but they have no control over the world market price for crude oil
__label__0 coffee shops use coffee as a key input  but they have no control over the world market price of coffee
__label__0 however  for a few goods  an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good  for example  those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers  because they are buying more steak instead  or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer
__label__1 when the income elasticity of demand is negative  the good is called an inferior good  the concepts of normal and inferior goods were introduced in demand and supply
__label__1 a higher level of income for a normal good causes a demand curve to shift to the right for a normal good  which means that the income elasticity of demand is positive
__label__1 in markets for financial capital  the elasticity of savings  that is  the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by the percentage change in interest rates  will describe the shape of the supply curve for financial capital
__label__0 that is
__label__1 private enterprise  the ownership of businesses by private individuals  is a hallmark of the us economy
__label__0 when people think of businesses  often giants like wal  mart  microsoft  or general motors come to mind
__label__0 these two definitions of cost are important for distinguishing between two conceptions of profit  accounting profit and economic profit
__label__0 accounting profit is a cash concept
__label__1 it means total revenue minus explicit costs  the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out
__label__0 however  the cost structure of all firms can be broken down into some common underlying patterns
__label__0 when a firm looks at its total costs of production in the short run  a useful starting point is to divide total costs into two categories  fixed costs that can not be changed in the short run and variable costs that can be changed  fixed and variable costs
__label__0 at some point  you may even see negative returns as the additional barbers begin bumping elbows and getting in each other s way
__label__0 in this case  the addition of still more barbers would actually cause output to decrease  as shown in the last row of  linkthis pattern of diminishing marginal returns is common in production
__label__0 as another example  consider the problem of irrigating a crop on a farmer s field
__label__0 marginal cost is somewhat different
__label__1 marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output
__label__0 so it is not the cost per unit of all units being produced  but only the next one  or next few
__label__0 this pattern was illustrated earlier in  linkin the middle portion of the long  run average cost curve  the flat portion of the curve around q  economies of scale have been exhausted
__label__0 in this situation  allowing all inputs to expand does not much change the average cost of production  and it is called constant returns to scale
__label__0 in this range of the lrac curve  the average cost of production does not change much as scale rises or falls
__label__0 when the price of a gallon of gasoline goes up  for example  people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands  commuting by carpool or mass transit  or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home
__label__1 economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of demand
__label__0 the law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand  to be explained in the next module  are held constant
__label__1 when economists talk about supply  they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price
__label__1 price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service
__label__0 when the price of gasoline rises  for example  it encourages profit  seeking firms to take several actions  expand exploration for oil reserves  drill for more oil  invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline  build new oil refineries  purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations  and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours
__label__1 economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity supplied  that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied  the law of supply
__label__0 the law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply  to be explained in the next module  are held constant
__label__0 remember this  when two lines on a diagram cross  this intersection usually means something
__label__1 the point where the supply curve  s  and the demand curve  d  cross  designated by point e in  link   is called the equilibrium
__label__1 the equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree  that is  where the amount of the product consumers want to buy  quantity demanded  is equal to the amount producers want to sell  quantity supplied
__label__1 in fact  at any above  equilibrium price  the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded
__label__0 we call this an excess supply or a surplus
__label__0 a demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two  and only two  variables  quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis
__label__0 the assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors  other than the product s price  are changing
__label__0 they will be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home  and so on
__label__1 a product whose demand falls when income rises  and vice versa  is called an inferior good
__label__0 in other words  when income increases  the demand curve shifts to the left
__label__1 other goods are complements for each other  meaning that the goods are often used together  because consumption of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other
__label__0 examples include breakfast cereal and milk  notebooks and pens or pencils  golf balls and golf clubs  gasoline and sport utility vehicles  and the five  way combination of bacon  lettuce  tomato  mayonnaise  and bread
__label__1 in thinking about the factors that affect supply  remember what motivates firms  profits  which are the difference between revenues and costs
__label__1 goods and services are produced using combinations of labor  materials  and machinery  or what we call inputs or factors of production
__label__0 if a firm faces lower costs of production  while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged  a firm s profits go up
__label__0 how can an economist sort out all these interconnected events
__label__0 the answer lies in the ceteris paribus assumption
__label__1 look at how each economic event affects each market  one event at a time  holding all else constant
__label__0 price controls come in two flavors
__label__1 a price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level  the  ceiling    while a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level  the  floor
__label__0 this section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze price ceilings
__label__0 if nurses  salaries in minneapolis  st  paul  bloomington are higher than in other cities  more nurses will move to minneapolis  st  paul  bloomington to find jobs  more people will be willing to train as nurses  and those currently trained as nurses will be more likely to pursue nursing as a full  time job
__label__0 in other words  there will be more nurses looking for jobs in the area
__label__1 at equilibrium  the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal
__label__0 thus  every employer who wants to hire a nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker  and every nurse who wants to work at this equilibrium salary can find a job
__label__0 the labor market  however  presents some prominent examples of price floors  which are often used as an attempt to increase the wages of low  paid workers
__label__1 the us government sets a minimum wage  a price floor that makes it illegal for an employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate
__label__0 in mid   the us minimum wage was raised to   per hour
__label__1 many states do have usury laws  which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can charge
__label__0 however  in many cases these upper limits are well above the market interest rate
__label__1 information on the consumption choices of americans is available from the consumer expenditure survey carried out by the us bureau of labor statistics
__label__0 link  shows spending patterns for the average us household
__label__1 jos wishes to choose the combination that will provide him with the greatest utility  which is the term economists use to describe a person s level of satisfaction or happiness with his or her choices  let s begin with an assumption  which will be discussed in more detail later  that jos can measure his own utility with something called utils
__label__0 it is important to note that you can not make comparisons between the utils of individuals  if one person gets  utils from a cup of coffee and another gets  utils  this does not mean than the first person gets more enjoyment from the coffee than the other or that they enjoy the coffee twice as much
__label__0 another way to look at this is by focusing on satisfaction per dollar
__label__1 marginal utility per dollar is the amount of additional utility jos receives given the price of the product
__label__0 for jos s t  shirts and movies  the marginal utility per dollar is shown in  link
__label__0 let s begin with a concrete example illustrating how changes in income level affect consumer choices
__label__0 link  shows a budget constraint that represents kimberly s choice between concert tickets at   each and getting away overnight to a bed  and  breakfast for   per night
__label__0 kimberly has   per year to spend between these two choices
__label__0 a choice like p means that a rise in income caused her quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline  while a choice like q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to decline
__label__1 goods where demand declines as income rises  or conversely  where the demand rises as income falls  are called  inferior goods
__label__0 an inferior good occurs when people trim back on a good as income rises  because they can now afford the more expensive choices that they prefer
__label__0 for example  a higher  income household might eat fewer hamburgers or be less likely to buy a used car  and instead eat more steak and buy a new car
__label__0 rates of saving in america have never been especially high  but they seem to have dipped even lower in recent years  as the data from the bureau of economic analysis in  link  show
__label__0 a decision about how much to save can be represented using an intertemporal budget constraint
__label__0 household decisions about the quantity of financial savings show the same underlying pattern of logic as the consumption choice decision and the labor  leisure decision
__label__0 this insight suggests some skepticism about political proposals to encourage higher savings by providing savers with a higher rate of return
__label__1 for example  individual retirement accounts  iras  and k  accounts are special savings accounts where the money going into the account is not taxed until it is taken out many years later  after retirement
__label__0 the main difference between these accounts is that an ira is usually set up by an individual  while a k  needs to be set up through an employer
__label__1 another area that seems illogical is the idea of mental accounting  or putting dollars in different mental categories where they take different values
__label__0 economists typically consider dollars to be fungible  or having equal value to the individual  regardless of the situation
__label__0 you might  for instance  think of the   you found in the street differently from the   you earned from three hours working in a fast food restaurant
__label__1 a perfectly competitive firm is known as a price taker  because the pressure of competing firms forces them to accept the prevailing equilibrium price in the market
__label__0 if a firm in a perfectly competitive market raises the price of its product by so much as a penny  it will lose all of its sales to competitors
__label__0 link  presents the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves based on the total revenue and total cost in  link
__label__1 the marginal revenue curve shows the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit
__label__0 as mentioned before  a firm in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product  that is  the firm s demand curve is a horizontal line drawn at the market price level
__label__0 but in the long run  firms that are facing losses will shut down at least some of their output  and some firms will cease production altogether
__label__1 the long  run process of reducing production in response to a sustained pattern of losses is called exit
__label__0 the following clear it up feature discusses where some of these losses might come from  and the reasons why some firms go out of business
__label__0 why do firms cease to exist
__label__1 for a constant cost industry  whenever there is an increase in market demand and price  then the supply curve shifts to the right with new firms  entry and stops at the point where the new long  run equilibrium intersects at the same market price as before
__label__0 but why will costs remain the same
__label__0 when profit  maximizing firms in perfectly competitive markets combine with utility  maximizing consumers  something remarkable happens  the resulting quantities of outputs of goods and services demonstrate both productive and allocative efficiency  terms that were first introduced in  choice in a world of scarcity
__label__1 productive efficiency means producing without waste  so that the choice is on the production possibility frontier
__label__0 in the long run in a perfectly competitive market  because of the process of entry and exit  the price in the market is equal to the minimum of the long  run average cost curve
__label__0 these profits should attract vigorous competition as described in perfect competition  and yet  because of one particular characteristic of monopoly  they do not
__label__1 barriers to entry are the legal  technological  or market forces that discourage or prevent potential competitors from entering a market
__label__0 barriers to entry can range from the simple and easily surmountable  such as the cost of renting retail space  to the extremely restrictive
__label__0 economies of scale can combine with the size of the market to limit competition
__label__0 this theme was introduced in cost and industry structure
__label__0 a copyright  according to the us
__label__1 copyright office   is a form of protection provided by the laws of the united states for  original works of authorship  including literary  dramatic  musical  architectural  cartographic  choreographic  pantomimic  pictorial  graphic  sculptural  and audiovisual creations
__label__0 no one can reproduce  display  or perform a copyrighted work without permission of the author
__label__0 att lost its monopoly on long distance service when the technology for providing phone service changed from wires to microwave and satellite transmission  so that multiple firms could use the same transmission mechanism
__label__0 the same thing happened to local service  especially in recent years  with the growth in cellular phone systems
__label__0 the combination of improvements in production technologies and a general sense that the markets could provide services adequately led to a wave of deregulation  starting in the late s and continuing into the s
__label__0 this wave eliminated or reduced government restrictions on the firms that could enter  the prices that could be charged  and the quantities that could be produced in many industries  including telecommunications  airlines  trucking  banking  and electricity
__label__0 but a monopolist often has fairly reliable information about how changing output by small or moderate amounts will affect its marginal revenues and marginal costs  because it has had experience with such changes over time and because modest changes are easier to extrapolate from current experience
__label__1 a monopolist can use information on marginal revenue and marginal cost to seek out the profit  maximizing combination of quantity and price
__label__0 allocative efficiency is a social concept
__label__1 it refers to producing the optimal quantity of some output  the quantity where the marginal benefit to society of one more unit just equals the marginal cost
__label__0 one type of imperfectly competitive market is called monopolistic competition
__label__1 monopolistically competitive markets feature a large number of competing firms  but the products that they sell are not identical
__label__1 a firm can try to make its products different from those of its competitors in several ways  physical aspects of the product  location from which the product is sold  intangible aspects of the product  and perceptions of the product
__label__0 products that are distinctive in one of these ways are called differentiated products
__label__0 as an example of a profit  maximizing monopolistic competitor  consider the authentic chinese pizza store  which serves pizza with cheese  sweet and sour sauce  and your choice of vegetables and meats
__label__0 although authentic chinese pizza must compete against other pizza businesses and restaurants  it has a differentiated product
__label__0 as long as the firm is earning positive economic profits  new competitors will continue to enter the market  reducing the original firm s demand and marginal revenue curves
__label__1 the long  run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point y  where the firm s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve
__label__0 when price is equal to average cost  economic profits are zero
__label__0 critics of market  oriented economies argue that society does not really need dozens of different athletic shoes or breakfast cereals or automobiles
__label__0 they argue that much of the cost of creating such a high degree of product differentiation  and then of advertising and marketing this differentiation  is socially wasteful  that is  most people would be just as happy with a smaller range of differentiated products produced and sold at a lower price
__label__0 defenders of a market  oriented economy respond that if people do not want to buy differentiated products or highly advertised brand names  no one is forcing them to do so
__label__0 quantity demanded in the market may also be two or three times the quantity needed to produce at the minimum of the average cost curve  which means that the market would have room for only two or three oligopoly firms  and they need not produce differentiated products
__label__0 again  smaller firms would have higher average costs and be unable to compete  while additional large firms would produce such a high quantity that they would not be able to sell it at a profitable price
__label__0 in the united states  as well as many other countries  it is illegal for firms to collude since collusion is anti  competitive behavior  which is a violation of antitrust law
__label__0 both the antitrust division of the justice department and the federal trade commission have responsibilities for preventing collusion in the united states
__label__1 the prisoner s dilemma is a scenario in which the gains from cooperation are larger than the rewards from pursuing self  interest
__label__0 it applies well to oligopoly
__label__0 if a group of us companies signed such a contract  however  it would be illegal
__label__0 certain international organizations  like the nations that are members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  opec   have signed international agreements to act like a monopoly  hold down output  and keep prices high so that all of the countries can make high profits from oil exports
__label__0 such agreements  however  because they fall in a gray area of international law  are not legally enforceable
__label__0 thus  if oligopolists always match price cuts by other firms in the cartel  but do not match price increases  then none of the oligopolists will have a strong incentive to change prices  since the potential gains are minimal
__label__0 this strategy can work like a silent form of cooperation  in which the cartel successfully manages to hold down output  increase price  and share a monopoly level of profits even without any legally enforceable agreement
__label__1 the laws that give government the power to block certain mergers  and even in some cases to break up large firms into smaller ones  are called antitrust laws
__label__0 before a large merger happens  the antitrust regulators at the ftc and the us department of justice can allow the merger  prohibit it  or allow it if certain conditions are met
__label__1 also in   the federal trade commission  ftc  was created to define more specifically what competition was unfair
__label__0 in   the celler  kefauver act extended the clayton act by restricting vertical and conglomerate mergers
__label__0 in the twenty  first century  the ftc and the us department of justice continue to enforce antitrust laws
__label__0 another approach to measuring industry concentration that can distinguish between these two cases is called the herfindahl  hirschman index  hhi
__label__1 the hhi  as it is often called  is calculated by summing the squares of the market share of each firm in the industry  as the following work it out shows
__label__0 for more on the difficulties of defining markets  refer to monopoly
__label__0 this new approach to antitrust regulation involves detailed analysis of specific markets and companies  instead of defining a market and counting up total sales
__label__0 a common starting point is for antitrust regulators to use statistical tools and real  world evidence to estimate the demand curves and supply curves faced by the firms that are proposing the merger
__label__0 a second step is to specify how competition occurs in this specific industry
__label__0 an exclusive dealing agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer can be legal or illegal
__label__0 it is legal if the purpose of the contract is to encourage competition between dealers
__label__0 computer software manufacturers may often bundle together a number of different programs  even when the buyer wants only a few of the programs
__label__0 think about the software that is included in a new computer purchase  for example
__label__0 recall from the chapter on monopoly that predatory pricing occurs when the existing firm  or firms  reacts to a new firm by dropping prices very low  until the new firm is driven out of the market  at which point the existing firm raises prices again
__label__0 this pattern of pricing is aimed at deterring the entry of new firms into the market
__label__0 so what then is the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly
__label__0 link  illustrates the case of natural monopoly  with a market demand curve that cuts through the downward  sloping portion of the average cost curve
__label__0 points a  b  c  and f illustrate four of the main choices for regulation
__label__1 thus  in the s and s  some regulators of public utilities began to use price cap regulation  where the regulator sets a price that the firm can charge over the next few years
__label__0 a common pattern was to require a price that declined slightly over time
__label__0 a number of major accounting scandals involving prominent corporations such as enron  tyco international  and worldcom led to the sarbanes  oxley act in
__label__1 sarbanes  oxley was designed to increase confidence in financial information provided by public corporations to protect investors from accounting fraud
__label__0 in this case  the sellers and buyers of concert tickets may both be quite satisfied with their voluntary exchange  but you have no voice in their market transaction
__label__1 the effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or  external  to the exchange is called an externality
__label__0 because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved  they are sometimes called spillovers  externalities can be negative or positive
__label__0 if you hate country music  then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality
__label__0 if you love country music  then what amounts to a series of free concerts would be a positive externality
__label__0 now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution  that is  the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator  but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution
__label__0 if the firm is required to pay   for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator  production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by
__label__1 in   the environmental protection agency  epa  was created to oversee all environmental laws
__label__1 in the same year  the clean air act was enacted to address air pollution
__label__0 just two years later  in   congress passed and the president signed the far  reaching clean water act
__label__0 link  illustrates the marginal costs that a firm faces in reducing pollution
__label__0 the marginal cost of pollution reduction  like most most marginal cost curves increases with output  at least in the short run
__label__0 reducing the first  pounds of particulate emissions costs the firm
__label__1 coase pointed out that this issue can not be resolved until property rights are clearly defined  that is  the legal rights of ownership on which others are not allowed to infringe without paying compensation
__label__0 does the farmer have a property right not to have a field burned
__label__0 link  illustrates a theoretical model of this situation
__label__0 when the quantity of environmental protection is low so that pollution is extensive  for example  at quantity qa  there are usually a lot of relatively cheap and easy ways to reduce pollution  and the marginal benefits of doing so are quite high
__label__0 at qa  it makes sense to allocate more resources to fight pollution
__label__0 although a nation can protect biodiversity within its own borders  no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity around the world
__label__0 global warming and biodiversity are examples of international externalities  bringing the nations of the world together to address environmental issues requires a difficult set of negotiations between countries with different income levels and different sets of priorities
__label__0 if nations such as china  india  brazil  mexico  and others are developing their economies by burning vast amounts of fossil fuels or by stripping their forest and wildlife habitats  then the world s high  income countries acting alone will not be able to reduce greenhouse gases
__label__0 economists do not have a great deal to say about the choice between p  q  r  s and t in  link   all of which lie along the production possibility frontier
__label__0 countries with low per capita gross domestic product  gdp   such as china  place a greater emphasis on economic output  which in turn helps to produce nutrition  shelter  health  education  and desirable consumer goods
__label__0 countries with higher income levels  where a greater share of people have access to the basic necessities of life  may be willing to place a relatively greater emphasis on environmental protection
__label__0 market competition can provide an incentive for discovering new technology because a firm can earn higher profits by finding a way to produce products more cheaply or to create products with characteristics consumers want
__label__0 as gregory lee  ceo of samsung said   relentless pursuit of new innovation is the key principle of our business and enables consumers to discover a world of possibilities with technology
__label__0 an innovative firm knows that it will usually have a temporary edge over its competitors and thus an ability to earn above  normal profits before competitors can catch up
__label__0 if a firm builds a factory or buys a piece of equipment  the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments
__label__0 however  when a firm invests in new technology  the private benefits  or profits  that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits
__label__1 the social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product  whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole  as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology
__label__1 the social benefit of the drug takes into account the value of all the positive externalities of the drug
__label__0 if big drug were able to gain this social return instead of other companies  its demand for financial capital would shift to the demand curve dsocial  and it would be willing to borrow and invest   million
__label__0 however  if big drug is receiving only  cents of each dollar of social benefits  the firm will not spend as much on creating new products
__label__0 after all  positive externalities exist from investment in education
__label__1 while not always easy to measure  according to walter mcmahon  the positive externalities to education typically include better health outcomes for the population  lower levels of crime  a cleaner environment and a more stable  democratic government
__label__0 for these reasons  many nations have chosen to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize primary  secondary  and higher education
__label__0 state and federal governments support research in a variety of ways
__label__1 for example  united for medical research  a coalition of groups that seek funding for the national institutes of health   which is supported by federal grants   states   nih  supported research added   billion to our gdp and supported seven million jobs in  alone
__label__0 the united states remains the leading sponsor of medical  related research spending   billion in
__label__0 other institutions  such as the national academy of scientists and the national academy of engineers  receive federal grants for innovative projects
__label__1 what about a situation where the positive externalities are so extensive that private firms could not expect to receive any of the social benefit
__label__0 this kind of good is called a public good
__label__0 spending on national defense is a good example of a public good
__label__1 when individuals make decisions about buying a public good  a free rider problem can arise  in which people have an incentive to let others pay for the public good and then to  free ride  on the purchases of others
__label__0 the term government describes the means by which a society organizes itself and allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs
__label__0 among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity for the nation  secure national borders  and the safety and well  being of citizens
__label__0 
__label__0 the government of the united states can best be described as a republic  or representative democracy
__label__1 a democracy is a government in which political power  influence over institutions  leaders  and policies  rests in the hands of the people
__label__1 a democracy is a government in which political power  influence over institutions  leaders  and policies  rests in the hands of the people
__label__0 in a representative democracy  however  the citizens do not govern directly
__label__0 however  in representative governments like the united states  minority rights are protected  people can not be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be
__label__0 for example  let s say american society decided that atheists  people who do not believe that god exists  were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country
__label__0 the foremost supporter of elite theory was c wright mills
__label__0 in his book  the power elite  mills argued that government was controlled by a combination of business  military  and political elites
__label__0 c
__label__1 according to pluralist theory  people with shared interests will form groups in order to make their desires known to politicians
__label__0 these groups include such entities as environmental advocates  unions  and organizations that represent the interests of various businesses
__label__1 the first amendment of the constitution gives americans the right to express their opinions on matters of concern to them  the federal government can not interfere with this right
__label__1 because of the fourteenth amendment  state governments must protect this right also
__label__0 at the same time  neither the federal government nor state governments can allow someone s right to free expression to interfere with someone else s ability to exercise his or her own rights
__label__0 bowling alone  the collapse and revival of american community
__label__0 new york  simon  schuster
__label__0 putnam argues that a decline in social capital   the collective value of all  social networks   those whom people know  and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other   accompanies this decline in membership in small  interactive groups
__label__0 
__label__0 
__label__0 therefore  one could be sure that election results were reliable and that the winning candidate had in fact received the votes counted in their favor
__label__0 common cause has also advocated that the electoral college be done away with and that presidential elections be decided solely on the basis of the popular vote
__label__0 such tactics were used successfully in the african american civil rights movement of the s and s and remain effective today
__label__0 likewise  the sit  ins  and sleep  ins and pray  ins  staged by african american civil rights activists  which they employed successfully to desegregate lunch counters  motels  and churches  have been adopted today by movements such as black lives matter and occupy wall street   link
__label__0 other tactics  such as boycotting businesses of whose policies the activists disapproved  are also still common
__label__0 americans aged  were less likely to become involved in traditional forms of political activity than older americans
__label__0 a  poll of more than three thousand young adults by harvard university s institute of politics revealed that only  percent claimed to be politically engaged  and fewer than  percent said that they belonged to any type of political organization or had volunteered for a political campaign
__label__0 who votes  who does nt  and why   httpwwwpeoplepressorgwhovoteswhodoesntandwhy
__label__0 political involvement also depends on how strongly people feel about current political issues
__label__0 unfortunately  public opinion polls  which politicians may rely on when formulating policy or deciding how to vote on issues  capture only people s latent preferences or beliefs
__label__0 latent preferences are not deeply held and do not remain the same over time
__label__0 of all the political thinkers who influenced american beliefs about government  the most important is surely john locke   link
__label__0 the most significant contributions of locke  a seventeenth  century english philosopher  were his ideas regarding the relationship between government and natural rights  which were believed to be god  given rights to life  liberty  and property
__label__1 people sacrificed a small portion of their freedom and consented to be ruled in exchange for the government s protection of their lives  liberty  and property
__label__0 locke called this implicit agreement between a people and their government the social contract
__label__0 should government deprive people of their rights by abusing the power given to it  the contract was broken and the people were no longer bound by its terms
__label__0 all this began to change in  when the seven years war between great britain and france came to an end  and great britain gained control of most of the french territory in north america
__label__0 the colonists had fought on behalf of britain  and many colonists expected that after the war they would be allowed to settle on land west of the appalachian mountains that had been taken from france
__label__0 the first such tax to draw the ire of colonists was the stamp act  passed in   which required that almost all paper goods  such as diplomas  land deeds  contracts  and newspapers  have revenue stamps placed on them
__label__1 the outcry was so great that the new tax was quickly withdrawn  but its repeal was soon followed by a series of other tax acts  such as the townshend acts     which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass  tea  and paint
__label__0 new york  free press
__label__0 this act of defiance became known as the boston tea party
__label__0 today  many who do not agree with the positions of the democratic or the republican party have organized themselves into an oppositional group dubbed the tea party   link
__label__0 in may   delegates met again in the second continental congress
__label__0 by this time  war with great britain had already begun  following skirmishes between colonial militiamen and british troops at lexington and concord  massachusetts
__label__1 drafted by thomas jefferson  the declaration of independence officially proclaimed the colonies  separation from britain
__label__0 in it  jefferson eloquently laid out the reasons for rebellion
__label__0 many also worried that even a government of representatives elected by the people might become too powerful and overbearing
__label__1 thus  a confederation was created  an entity in which independent  self  governing states form a union for the purpose of acting together in areas such as defense
__label__0 fearful of replacing one oppressive national government with another  however  the framers of the articles of confederation created an alliance of sovereign states held together by a weak central government
__label__0 one of the biggest problems was that the national government had no power to impose taxes
__label__0 to avoid any perception of  taxation without representation   the articles of confederation allowed only state governments to levy taxes
__label__0 in   virginia and maryland invited delegates from the other eleven states to meet in annapolis  maryland  for the purpose of revising the articles of confederation
__label__0 however  only five states sent representatives
__label__0 fifty  five delegates arrived in philadelphia in may  for the meeting that became known as the constitutional convention
__label__0 many wanted to strengthen the role and authority of the national government but feared creating a central government that was too powerful
__label__0 delegates from small states objected to this virginia plan
__label__1 another proposal  the new jersey plan  called for a unicameral legislature with one house  in which each state would have one vote
__label__0 the constitution consists of a preamble and seven articles
__label__0 the first three articles divide the national government into three branches  congress  the executive branch  and the federal judiciary  and describe the powers and responsibilities of each
__label__0 the three  fifths compromise  illustrated in  link   resolved the impasse  although not in a manner that truly satisfied anyone
__label__0 for purposes of congressional apportionment  slaveholding states were allowed to count all their free population  including free african americans and  percent  three  fifths  of their enslaved population
__label__0 neither of these branches had existed under the articles of confederation
__label__0 thus  congress can pass laws  but its power to do so can be checked by the president  who can veto potential legislation so that it can not become a law
__label__1 later  in the  case of marbury v madison  the us supreme court established its own authority to rule on the constitutionality of laws  a process called judicial review
__label__1 all powers not expressly given to the national government  however  were intended to be exercised by the states
__label__0 these powers are known as reserved powers   link
__label__0 thus  states remained free to pass laws regarding such things as intrastate commerce  commerce within the borders of a state  and marriage
__label__0 this approach to ratification was an unusual one
__label__0 since the authority inherent in the articles of confederation and the confederation congress had rested on the consent of the states  changes to the nation s government should also have been ratified by the state legislatures
__label__0 john adams and thomas jefferson carried on a lively correspondence regarding the ratification of the constitution
__label__0 in the following excerpt  reproduced as written  from a letter dated march     after the constitution had been ratified by nine states but before it had been approved by all thirteen  jefferson reiterates his previously expressed concerns that a bill of rights to protect citizens  freedoms was necessary and should be added to the constitution
__label__0 anti  federalists feared the power of the national government and believed state legislatures  with which they had more contact  could better protect their freedoms
__label__0 although some anti  federalists  like patrick henry  were wealthy  most distrusted the elite and believed a strong federal government would favor the rich over those of  the middling sort
__label__0 this was certainly the fear of melancton smith  a new york merchant and landowner  who believed that power should rest in the hands of small  landowning farmers of average wealth who  are more temperate  of better morals and less ambitious than the great
__label__0 isaac krannick
__label__0 facing considerable opposition to the constitution in that state  alexander hamilton  james madison  and john jay wrote a series of essays  beginning in   arguing for a strong federal government and support of the constitution   link
__label__0 later compiled as the federalist and now known as the federalist papers  these eighty  five essays were originally published in newspapers in new york and other states under the name of publius  a supporter of the roman republic
__label__0 an aristocracy would not arise  and if it did  its members would have been chosen by lesser men
__label__0 similarly  jay reminded new yorkers in federalist no
__label__0 that union had been the goal of americans since the time of the revolution
__label__0 because these men would be members of a  transient  body called together only for the purpose of choosing the president and would meet in separate deliberations in each state  they would be free of corruption and beyond the influence of the  heats and ferments  of the voters
__label__0 indeed  hamilton argued in federalist no    instead of being afraid that the president would become a tyrant  americans should realize that it was easier to control one person than it was to control many
__label__0 responding to charges by anti  federalists that the constitution made the national government too powerful and provided no protections for the rights of individuals  the newly elected federal government tackled the issue of guaranteeing liberties for american citizens
__label__0 james madison  a member of congress from virginia  took the lead in drafting nineteen potential changes to the constitution
__label__1 the bill of rights was intended to quiet the fears of anti  federalists that the constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government
__label__0 many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the english bill of rights and the virginia declaration of rights
__label__0 for example  the right to bear arms for protection  second amendment   the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime  third amendment   the right to a trial by jury  sixth and seventh amendments   and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment  eighth amendment  are taken from the english bill of rights
__label__0 other liberties  however  do not derive from british precedents
__label__0 the protections for religion  speech  the press  and assembly that are granted by the first amendment did not exist under english law
__label__0 the right to petition the government did  however
__label__1 the supreme court  for example  has held that the ninth amendment protects the right to privacy even though none of the preceding amendments explicitly mentions this right
__label__1 the tenth amendment  one of the first submitted to the states for ratification  ensures that states possess all powers not explicitly assigned to the federal government by the constitution
__label__0 this guarantee protects states  reserved powers to regulate such things as marriage  divorce  and intrastate transportation and commerce  and to pass laws affecting education and public health and safety
__label__0 in a time of crisis  like a severe economic depression  the president needed to take office almost immediately after being elected  and modern transportation allowed the new president to travel to the nation s capital quicker than before
__label__1 the twenty  second amendment  added in   limits the president to two terms in office  and the twenty  seventh amendment  first submitted for ratification in   regulates the implementation of laws regarding salary increases or decreases for members of congress
__label__0 when states began to change property requirements for voters in the s  many that had allowed free  property  owning african american men to vote restricted the suffrage to white men
__label__1 the fifteenth amendment gave men the right to vote regardless of race or color  but women were still prohibited from voting in most states
__label__1 after many years of campaigns for suffrage  as shown in  link   the nineteenth amendment finally gave women the right to vote in
__label__1 the twenty  third amendment    allowed residents of washington  dc to vote for the president
__label__1 the twenty  fourth amendment    abolished the use of poll taxes
__label__0 many southern states had used a poll tax  a tax placed on voting  to prevent poor african americans from voting
__label__0 american federalism also seeks to balance the forces of decentralization and centralization
__label__0 we see decentralization when we cross state lines and encounter different taxation levels  welfare eligibility requirements  and voting regulations  to name just a few
__label__0 in the united states  conflicts between states and the federal government are adjudicated by federal courts  with the us supreme court being the final arbiter
__label__0 the resolution of such disputes can preserve the autonomy of one level of government  as illustrated recently when the supreme court ruled that states can not interfere with the federal government s actions relating to immigration  arizona v united states   us
__label__0 in other instances  a supreme court ruling can erode that autonomy  as demonstrated in the s when  in united states v wrightwood dairy co  the court enabled the federal government to regulate commercial activities that occurred within states  a function previously handled exclusively by the states  united states v wrightwood dairy co   us
__label__0 in a confederation  authority is decentralized  and the central government s ability to act depends on the consent of the subnational governments
__label__1 under the articles of confederation  the first constitution of the united states   states were sovereign and powerful while the national government was subordinate and weak
__label__0 because states were reluctant to give up any of their power  the national government lacked authority in the face of challenges such as servicing the war debt  ending commercial disputes among states  negotiating trade agreements with other countries  and addressing popular uprisings that were sweeping the country
__label__0 cambridge  ma  harvard university press
__label__0 however  when it came time to ratify the constitution  a number of states requested that an amendment be added explicitly identifying the reserved powers of the states
__label__0 what these anti  federalists sought was further assurance that the national government s capacity to act directly on behalf of the people would be restricted  which the first ten amendments  bill of rights  provided
__label__0 the tenth amendment affirms the states  reserved powers   the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution  nor prohibited by it to the states  are reserved to the states respectively  or to the people
__label__0 indeed  state constitutions had bills of rights  which the first congress used as the source for the first ten amendments to the constitution
__label__0 the most important restriction section  places on the national government prevents measures that cause the deprivation of personal liberty
__label__0 specifically  the government can not suspend the writ of habeas corpus  which enables someone in custody to petition a judge to determine whether that person s detention is legal  pass a bill of attainder  a legislative action declaring someone guilty without a trial  or enact an ex post facto law  which criminalizes an act retroactively
__label__0 the bill of rights affirms and expands these constitutional restrictions  ensuring that the government can not encroach on personal freedoms
__label__0 various constitutional provisions govern state  to  state relations
__label__0 article iv  section   referred to as the full faith and credit clause or the comity clause  requires the states to accept court decisions  public acts  and contracts of other states
__label__0 thus  an adoption certificate or driver s license issued in one state is valid in any other state
__label__0 scores of states considered legislation and ballot initiatives on the question
__label__0 the federal courts took up the issue with zeal after the us supreme court in united states v windsor struck down the part of doma that outlawed federal benefits  united states v windsor   us
__label__0 that move was followed by upwards of forty federal court decisions that upheld marriage equality in particular states
__label__0 in   the supreme court decided not to hear several key case appeals from a variety of states  all of which were brought by opponents of marriage equality who had lost in the federal courts
__label__0 state and local government figures are estimated
__label__0 two important developments have fundamentally changed the allocation of revenue since the early s
__label__0 first  the ratification of the sixteenth amendment in  authorized congress to impose income taxes without apportioning it among the states on the basis of population  a burdensome provision that article i  section   had imposed on the national government  pollock v farmers  loan  trust co   us
__label__0 with this change  the federal government s ability to raise revenue significantly increased and so did its ability to spend
__label__0 the second development regulates federal grants  that is  transfers of federal money to state and local governments
__label__0 these transfers  which do not have to be repaid  are designed to support the activities of the recipient governments  but also to encourage them to pursue federal policy objectives they might not otherwise adopt
__label__1 in   president obama signed the american recovery and reinvestment act  arra   which provided immediate economic  crisis management assistance such as helping local and state economies ride out the great recession and shoring up the country s banking sector
__label__0 a total of   billion in grants  contracts  and loans was allocated to state and local governments under the arra
__label__0 dilger   federal grants to state and local governments
__label__0 the bulk of the stimulus funds apportioned to state and local governments was used to create and protect existing jobs through public works projects and to fund various public welfare programs such as unemployment insurance
__label__0 james feyrer and bruce sacerdote
__label__0 for hamilton  the establishment of the bank of the united states was fully within congress s authority  and he hoped the bank would foster economic development  print and circulate paper money  and provide loans to the government
__label__0 although thomas jefferson  washington s secretary of state  staunchly opposed hamilton s plan on the constitutional grounds that the national government had no authority to create such an instrument  hamilton managed to convince the reluctant president to sign the legislation
__label__0 the lehrman institute
__label__0 the founding trio  washington  hamilton and jefferson   httplehrmaninstituteorghistoryfoundingtrioasp
__label__0 were states allowed to tax federal property
__label__0 in mcculloch v maryland  chief justice john marshall   link   argued that congress could create a national bank even though the constitution did not expressly authorize it  mcculloch v maryland   us
__label__0 under the necessary and proper clause of article i  section   the supreme court asserted that congress could establish  all means which are appropriate  to fulfill  the legitimate ends  of the constitution
__label__0 in other words  the bank was an appropriate instrument that enabled the national government to carry out several of its enumerated powers  such as regulating interstate commerce  collecting taxes  and borrowing money
__label__0 gibbons lost in new york state courts and appealed
__label__0 chief justice marshall delivered a two  part ruling in favor of gibbons that strengthened the power of the national government
__label__0 first  interstate commerce was interpreted broadly to mean  commercial intercourse  among states  thus allowing congress to regulate navigation
__label__1 when president john adams signed the sedition act in   which made it a crime to speak openly against the government  the kentucky and virginia legislatures passed resolutions declaring the act null on the grounds that they retained the discretion to follow national laws
__label__0 in effect  these resolutions articulated the legal reasoning underpinning the doctrine of nullification  that states had the right to reject national laws they deemed unconstitutional
__label__0 w  kirk wood
__label__0 south carolina passed an ordinance of nullification declaring both tariff acts null and void and threatened to leave the union
__label__0 the federal government responded by enacting the force bill in   authorizing president jackson to use military force against states that challenged federal tariff laws
__label__0 the prospect of military action coupled with the passage of the compromise tariff act of   which lowered tariffs over time  led south carolina to back off  ending the nullification crisis
__label__0 the ultimate showdown between national and state authority came during the civil war
__label__0 prior to the conflict  in dred scott v sandford  the supreme court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories  dred scott v sandford   us
__label__0 but the election of president abraham lincoln in  led eleven southern states to secede from the united states because they believed the new president would challenge the institution of slavery
__label__0 what was initially a conflict to preserve the union became a conflict to end slavery when lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation in   freeing all slaves in the rebellious states
__label__0 second  congress imposed several conditions for readmitting former confederate states into the union  among them was ratification of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments
__label__0 in sum  after the civil war the power balance shifted toward the national government  a movement that had begun several decades before with mcculloch v maryland    and gibbons v odgen
__label__0 new york  routledge
__label__1 to curtail widespread anticompetitive practices in the railroad industry  congress passed the interstate commerce act in   which created the interstate commerce commission
__label__1 three years later  national regulatory capacity was broadened by the sherman antitrust act of   which made it illegal to monopolize or attempt to monopolize and conspire in restraining commerce  figure commerce
__label__0 in the early stages of industrial capitalism  federal regulations were focused for the most part on promoting market competition rather than on addressing the social dislocations resulting from market operations  something the government began to tackle in the s  eisner  the american political economy  stephen skowronek
__label__1 for example  new york state passed the bakeshop act in   which prohibited bakery employees from working more than sixty hours in a week
__label__0 in lochner v new york  the supreme court ruled this state regulation that capped work hours unconstitutional  on the grounds that it violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment  lochner v new york   us
__label__0 in other words  the right to sell and buy labor is a  liberty of the individual  safeguarded by the constitution  the court asserted
__label__0 the federal government also took up the issue of working conditions  but that case resulted in the same outcome as in the lochner case
__label__0 hammer v dagenhart   us
__label__0 the new deal programs president franklin d roosevelt proposed as a means to tackle the great depression ran afoul of the dual  federalism mindset of the justices on the supreme court in the s
__label__0 the court struck down key pillars of the new deal  the national industrial recovery act and the agricultural adjustment act  for example  on the grounds that the federal government was operating in matters that were within the purview of the states
__label__0 in national labor relations board  nlrb  v jones and laughlin steel  national labor relations board  nlrb  v jones  laughlin steel   us
__label__1 for instance  the supreme court ruled the national labor relations act of  constitutional  asserting that congress can use its authority under the commerce clause to regulate both manufacturing activities and labor  management relations
__label__0 the new deal changed the relationship americans had with the national government
__label__0 in the s  president lyndon johnson s administration expanded the national government s role in society even more
__label__1 medicaid  which provides medical assistance to the indigent   medicare  which provides health insurance to the elderly and disabled   and school nutrition programs were created
__label__0 the elementary and secondary education act     the higher education act     and the head start preschool program    were established to expand educational opportunities and equality   link
__label__0 finally  laws were passed to promote urban renewal  public housing development  and affordable housing
__label__0 in addition to these great society programs  the civil rights act    and the voting rights act    gave the federal government effective tools to promote civil rights equality across the country
__label__0 during the administrations of presidents richard nixon      and ronald reagan       attempts were made to reverse the process of nationalization  that is  to restore states  prominence in policy areas into which the federal government had moved in the past
__label__0 new federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency  reduces overall public spending  and improves policy outcomes
__label__0 during nixon s administration  general revenue sharing programs were created that distributed funds to the state and local governments with minimal restrictions on how the money was spent
__label__0 several supreme court rulings also promoted new federalism by hemming in the scope of the national government s power  especially under the commerce clause
__label__1 for example  in united states v lopez  the court struck down the gun  free school zones act of   which banned gun possession in school zones  united states v lopez   us
__label__0 it argued that the regulation in question did not  substantively affect interstate commerce
__label__0 the ruling ended a nearly sixty  year period in which the court had used a broad interpretation of the commerce clause that by the s allowed it to regulate numerous local commercial activities
__label__0 see printz v united states   us
__label__0 morton grodzins coined the cake analogy of federalism in the s while conducting research on the evolution of american federalism
__label__1 until then most scholars had thought of federalism as a layer cake  but according to grodzins the s ushered in  marble  cake federalism    link
__label__1 the american form of government is often  but erroneously  symbolized by a three  layer cake
__label__0 medicaid and the food stamp program are examples of categorical grants
__label__1 block grants come with less stringent federal administrative conditions and provide recipients more flexibility over how to spend grant funds
__label__0 examples of block grants include the workforce investment act program  which provides state and local agencies money to help youths and adults obtain skill sets that will lead to better  paying jobs  and the surface transportation program  which helps state and local governments maintain and improve highways  bridges  tunnels  sidewalks  and bicycle paths
__label__0 president clinton vetoed the legislation
__label__0 however  congressional efforts to convert aid to families with dependent children  afdc  to a block grant succeeded
__label__1 the temporary assistance for needy families  tanf  block grant replaced the afdc in   marking the first time the federal government transformed an entitlement program  which guarantees individual rights to benefits  into a block grant
__label__1 unfunded mandates are federal laws and regulations that impose obligations on state and local governments without fully compensating them for the administrative costs they incur
__label__0 the federal government has used mandates increasingly since the s to promote national objectives in policy areas such as the environment  civil rights  education  and homeland security
__label__0 the widespread use of federal mandates in the s and s provoked a backlash among state and local authorities  which culminated in the unfunded mandates reform act  umra  in
__label__0 the umra s main objective has been to restrain the national government s use of mandates by subjecting rules that impose unfunded requirements on state and local governments to greater procedural scrutiny
__label__1 the clery act of   formally the jeanne clery disclosure of campus security policy and campus crime statistics act  requires public and private colleges and universities that participate in federal student aid programs to disclose information about campus crime
__label__0 the act is named after jeanne clery  who in  was raped and murdered by a fellow student in her lehigh university dorm room
__label__0 arizona has been one of the states at the forefront of immigration federalism
__label__0 in   it passed senate bill   which sought to make it so difficult for illegal immigrants to live in the state that they would return to their native country  a strategy referred to as  attrition by enforcement
__label__0 michele waslin
__label__0 in   in arizona v united states  the supreme court affirmed federal supremacy on immigration  arizona v united states   us
__label__0 the court struck down three of the four central provisions of the arizona law  namely  those allowing police officers to arrest an undocumented immigrant without a warrant if they had probable cause to think he or she had committed a crime that could lead to deportation  making it a crime to seek a job without proper immigration papers  and making it a crime to be in arizona without valid immigration papers
__label__0 the court upheld the  show me your papers  provision  which authorizes police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest who they suspect is an illegal immigrant  arizona v united states   us
__label__0 however  in letting this provision stand  the court warned arizona and other states with similar laws that they could face civil rights lawsuits if police officers applied it based on racial profiling  julia preston
__label__0 arizona ruling only a narrow opening for other states   new york times   june
__label__0 all in all  justice anthony kennedy s opinion embraced an expansive view of the us government s authority to regulate immigration and aliens  describing it as broad and undoubted
__label__0 that authority derived from the legislative power of congress to  establish a uniform rule of naturalization   enumerated in the constitution
__label__0 by   two years after massachusetts became the first state to recognize marriage equality  twenty  seven states had passed constitutional bans on same  sex marriage
__label__0 in united states v windsor  the supreme court changed the dynamic established by doma by ruling that the federal government had no authority to define marriage
__label__0 the court held that states possess the  historic and essential authority to define the marital relation   and that the federal government s involvement in this area  departs from this history and tradition of reliance on state law to define marriage
__label__0 united states v windsor   us
__label__0 the windsor case gave federal judges the moment of clarity from the us supreme court that they needed
__label__0 james esseks  director of the american civil liberties union s  aclu  lesbian gay bisexual transgender  aids project  summarizes the significance of the case as follows   part of what s gotten us to this exciting moment in american culture is not just edie s lawsuit but the story of her life
__label__0 the love at the core of that story  as well as the injustice at its end  is part of what has moved america on this issue so profoundly
__label__0 james esseks
__label__0 the  court decision not to hear a collection of cases from four different states essentially affirmed same  sex marriage in thirty states
__label__0 and in  the supreme court gave same  sex marriage a constitutional basis of right nationwide in obergefell v hodges
__label__0 in sum  as the immigration and marriage equality examples illustrate  constitutional disputes have arisen as states and the federal government have sought to reposition themselves on certain policy issues  disputes that the federal courts have had to sort out
__label__0 by creating two institutional access points  the federal and state governments  the us federal system enables interest groups such as madd to strategize about how best to achieve their policy objectives
__label__0 the term venue shopping refers to a strategy in which interest groups select the level and branch of government  legislature  judiciary  or executive  they calculate will be most advantageous for them  frank baumgartner and bryan jones
__label__0 
__label__0 for example  a number of new deal breakthroughs  such as child labor laws  were inspired by state policies
__label__0 prior to the passage of the nineteenth amendment  several states had already granted women the right to vote
__label__0 california has led the way in establishing standards for fuel emissions and other environmental policies   link
__label__0 more recently  president obama s effort to make health insurance accessible to more americans under the affordable care act immediately ran into legal challengesnational federation of independent business v sebelius   us
__label__0 from some states  but it has been supported by the supreme court so far
__label__0 however  the federal government s ability to defend the voting rights of citizens suffered a major setback when the supreme court in  struck down a key provision of the voting rights act of shelby county v holder   us
__label__0 no longer are the nine states with histories of racial discrimination in their voting processes required to submit plans for changes to the federal government for approval
__label__0 civil rights  on the other hand  are guarantees that government officials will treat people equally and that decisions will be made on the basis of merit rather than race  gender  or other personal characteristics
__label__0 because of the constitution s civil rights guarantee  it is unlawful for a school or university run by a state government to treat students differently based on their race  ethnicity  age  sex  or national origin
__label__0 the constitution as written in  did not include a bill of rights  although the idea of including one was proposed and  after brief discussion  dismissed in the final week of the constitutional convention
__label__0 the framers of the constitution believed they faced much more pressing concerns than the protection of civil rights and liberties  most notably keeping the fragile union together in the light of internal unrest and external threats
__label__0 prohibition of such laws means that the us congress can not simply punish people who are unpopular or seem to be guilty of crimes
__label__0 an ex post facto law has a retroactive effect  it can be used to punish crimes that were not crimes at the time they were committed  or it can be used to increase the severity of punishment after the fact
__label__0 debate has always swirled over these issues
__label__0 the federalists reasoned that the limited set of enumerated powers of congress  along with the limitations on those powers in article i  section   would suffice  and no separate bill of rights was needed
__label__0 alexander hamilton  writing as publius in federalist no
__label__0 however  the anti  federalists argued that the federalists  position was incorrect and perhaps even insincere
__label__0 the anti  federalists believed provisions such as the elastic clause in article i  section   of the constitution would allow congress to legislate on matters well beyond the limited ones foreseen by the constitution s authors  thus  they held that a bill of rights was necessary
__label__0 in the decades following the constitution s ratification  the supreme court declined to expand the bill of rights to curb the power of the states  most notably in the  case of barron v baltimore  barron v baltimore   us
__label__1 in this case  which dealt with property rights under the fifth amendment  the supreme court unanimously decided that the bill of rights applied only to actions by the federal government
__label__0 explaining the court s ruling  chief justice john marshall wrote that it was incorrect to argue that  the constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments  as well as against that which might be attempted by their  federal  government
__label__0 in the short term  they advocated suspending civilian government in most of the southern states and replacing politicians who had enacted the black codes
__label__1 their long  term solution was to propose two amendments to the constitution to guarantee the rights of freed slaves on an equal standing with whites  these rights became the fourteenth amendment  which dealt with civil liberties and rights in general  and the fifteenth amendment  which protected the right to vote in particular   link
__label__0 but  the right to vote did not yet apply to women or to native americans
__label__0 with the ratification of the fourteenth amendment in   civil liberties gained more clarification
__label__0 first  the amendment says   no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states   which is a provision that echoes the privileges and immunities clause in article iv  section   of the original constitution ensuring that states treat citizens of other states the same as their own citizens
__label__0 to use an example from today  the punishment for speeding by an out  of  state driver can not be more severe than the punishment for an in  state driver
__label__0 although the text of the provision does not mention rights specifically  the courts have held in a series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that can not be denied by the states
__label__0 for example  in sherbert v verner     the supreme court ruled that states could not deny unemployment benefits to an individual who turned down a job because it required working on the sabbath
__label__0 sherbert v verner   us
__label__0 when the supreme court initially decided in  that the second amendment protects an individual s right to keep and bear arms  it did not decide then that it was a fundamental liberty the states must uphold as well
__label__0 it was only in the mcdonald v chicago case two years later that the supreme court incorporated the second amendment into state law
__label__0 another area in which the supreme court gradually moved to incorporate the bill of rights regards censorship and the fourteenth amendment
__label__0 the first amendment is perhaps the most famous provision of the bill of rights  it is arguably also the most extensive  because it guarantees both religious freedoms and the right to express your views in public
__label__0 specifically  the first amendment says
__label__0 the key question that faces the courts is whether the establishment clause should be understood as imposing  in thomas jefferson s words   a wall of separation between church and state   in a  case known as lemon v kurtzman  the supreme court established the lemon test for deciding whether a law or other government action that might promote a particular religious practice should be allowed to stand  lemon v kurtzman   us
__label__0 the lemon test has three criteria that must be satisfied for such a law or action to be found constitutional and remain in effect
__label__0 the rights of conscientious objectors  individuals who claim the right to refuse to perform military service on the grounds of freedom of thought  conscience  or religion  have also been controversial  although many conscientious objectors have contributed service as non  combatant medics during wartime
__label__0 to avoid serving in the vietnam war  many people claimed to have a conscientious objection to military service on the basis that they believed this particular war was unwise or unjust
__label__0 in both sherbert v verner  a case dealing with unemployment compensation  and wisconsin v yoder  which dealt with the right of amish parents to homeschool their children  the court said that for a law to be allowed to limit or burden a religious practice  the government must meet two criteria  sherbert v verner   us      wisconsin v yoder   us
__label__0 it must demonstrate both that it had a  compelling governmental interest  in limiting that practice and that the restriction was  narrowly tailored
__label__0 in other words  it must show there was a very good reason for the law in question and that the law was the only feasible way of achieving that goal
__label__0 this standard became known as the sherbert test
__label__0 since the burden of proof in these cases was on the government  the supreme court made it very difficult for the federal and state governments to enforce laws against individuals that would infringe upon their religious beliefs
__label__0 such a conflict emerged in the  supreme court case known as burwell v hobby lobby
__label__0 burwell v hobby lobby stores  inc   us
__label__0 the hobby lobby chain of stores sells arts and crafts merchandise at hundreds of stores  its founder  david green  is a devout fundamentalist christian whose beliefs include opposition to abortion and contraception
__label__0 consistent with these beliefs  he used his business to object to a provision of the patient protection and affordable care act  aca or obamacare  requiring employer  backed insurance plans to include no  charge access to the morning  after pill  a form of emergency contraception  arguing that this requirement infringed on his conscience
__label__0 although the remainder of the first amendment protects four distinct rights  free speech  press  assembly  and petition  we generally think of these rights today as encompassing a right to freedom of expression  particularly since the world s technological evolution has blurred the lines between oral and written communication  ie  speech and press  in the centuries since the first amendment was written and adopted
__label__0 one such person was gregory lee johnson  a member of various pro  communist and antiwar groups
__label__0 in   as part of a protest near the republican national convention in dallas  texas  johnson set fire to a us flag that another protestor had torn from a flagpole
__label__0 freedom of the press is an important component of the right to free expression as well
__label__0 in near v minnesota  an early case regarding press freedoms  the supreme court ruled that the government generally could not engage in prior restraint  that is  states and the federal government could not in advance prohibit someone from publishing something without a very compelling reason  near v minnesota   us
__label__0 this standard was reinforced in  in the pentagon papers case  in which the supreme court found that the government could not prohibit the new york times and washington post newspapers from publishing the pentagon papers
__label__0 new york times co v united states   us
__label__0 these papers included materials from a secret history of the vietnam war that had been compiled by the military
__label__0 more specifically  the papers were compiled at the request of secretary of defense robert mcnamara and provided a study of us political and military involvement in vietnam from  to
__label__0 although people who leak secret information to the media can still be prosecuted and punished  this does not generally extend to reporters and news outlets that pass that information on to the public
__label__0 the edward snowden case is another good case in point
__label__0 defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts  supreme court justice potter stewart famously said of obscenity  having watched pornography in the supreme court building   i know it when i see it
__label__0 into the early twentieth century  written work was frequently banned as being obscene  including works by noted authors such as james joyce and henry miller  although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone
__label__1 in   the supreme court established the miller test for deciding whether something is obscene    a  whether the average person  applying contemporary community standards  would find that the work  taken as a whole  appeals to the prurient interest   b  whether the work depicts or describes  in a patently offensive way  sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law  and  c  whether the work  taken as a whole  lacks serious literary  artistic  political  or scientific value
__label__0 miller v california   us
__label__0 however  the application of this standard has at times been problematic
__label__0 in particular  the concept of  contemporary community standards  raises the possibility that obscenity varies from place to place  many people in new york or san francisco might not bat an eye at something people in memphis or salt lake city would consider offensive
__label__0 free expression includes the right to assemble peaceably and the right to petition government officials
__label__0 this right even extends to members of groups whose views most people find abhorrent  such as american nazis and the vehemently anti  gay westboro baptist church  whose members have become known for their protests at the funerals of us soldiers who have died fighting in the war on terror   link
__label__0 national socialist party of america v village of skokie   us      snyder v phelps   us
__label__0 free expression  although a broad right  is subject to certain constraints to balance it against the interests of public order
__label__0 in particular  the nature  place  and timing of protests  but not their substantive content  are subject to reasonable limits
__label__0 in the meantime  as part of their black codes designed to reintroduce most of the trappings of slavery  several southern states adopted laws that restricted the carrying and ownership of weapons by former slaves
__label__0 despite acknowledging a common  law individual right to keep and bear arms  in  the supreme court declined  in united states v cruickshank  to intervene to ensure the states would respect it
__label__0 united states v cruickshank   us
__label__0 v heller   us      p
__label__0 because the district of columbia is not a state  this decision immediately applied the right only to the federal government and territorial governments
__label__1 two years later  in mcdonald v chicago  the supreme court overturned the cruickshank decision      and again found that the right to bear arms was a fundamental right incorporated against the states  meaning that state regulation of firearms might  in some circumstances  be unconstitutional

__label__0 in either case  the amendment indicates that government officials are required to apply for and receive a search warrant prior to a search or seizure  this warrant is a legal document  signed by a judge  allowing police to search andor seize persons or property
__label__0 since the s  however  the supreme court has issued a series of rulings limiting the warrant requirement in situations where a person can be said to lack a  reasonable expectation of privacy  outside the home
__label__0 in addition to protecting the personal freedoms of individuals  the bill of rights protects those suspected or accused of crimes from various forms of unfair or unjust treatment
__label__0 the prominence of these protections in the bill of rights may seem surprising
__label__0 the most notable is that it prohibits a second prosecution only at the same level of government  federal or state  as the first  the federal government can try you for violating federal law  even if a state or local court finds you not guilty of the same action
__label__0 for example  in the early s  several los angeles police officers accused of brutally beating motorist rodney king during his arrest were acquitted of various charges in a state court  but some were later convicted in a federal court of violating king s civil rights
__label__0 the final provision of the fifth amendment has little to do with crime at all
__label__0 the takings clause says that  private property  can not  be taken for public use  without just compensation
__label__0 this provision  along with the due process clause s provisions limiting the taking of property  can be viewed as a protection of individuals  economic liberty  their right to obtain  use  and trade tangible and intangible property for their own benefit
__label__0 for example  you have the right to trade your knowledge  skills  and labor for money through work or the use of your property  or trade money or goods for other things of value  such as clothing  housing  education  or food
__label__0 once someone has been charged with a crime and indicted  the next stage in a criminal case is typically the trial itself  unless a plea bargain is reached
__label__1 the sixth amendment contains the provisions that govern criminal trials  in full  it states
__label__1 the seventh amendment deals with the rights of those engaged in civil disputes  as noted earlier  these are disagreements between individuals or businesses in which people are typically seeking compensation for some harm caused
__label__0 for example  in an automobile accident  the person responsible is compelled to compensate any others  either directly or through his or her insurance company
__label__0 at the same time  however  it appears that the public mood may have shifted somewhat against the death penalty  perhaps due in part to an overall decline in violent crime
__label__0 the reexamination of past cases through dna evidence has revealed dozens in which people were wrongfully executed
__label__0 elizabeth lopatto   how many innocent people are sentenced to death    forbes   april   httpwwwforbescomsiteselizabethlopattohowmanyinnocentpeoplearesentencedtodeatheaecc  march
__label__0 for example  claude jones was executed for murder based on  era dna testing of a single hair that was determined at that time to be his  however  with better dna testing technology  it was later found to be that of the victim
__label__0 dave mann   dna tests undermine evidence in texas execution  new results show claude jones was put to death on flawed evidence   texas observer   november   httpwwwtexasobserverorgtexasobserverexclusivednatestsundermineevidenceintexasexecution  march
__label__0 perhaps as a result of this and other cases  seven additional states have abolished capital punishment since
__label__0 as of   nineteen states and the district of columbia no longer apply the death penalty in new cases  and several other states do not carry out executions despite sentencing people to death
__label__0 see  for example   states with and without the death penalty   death penalty information center  httpwwwdeathpenaltyinfoorgstatesandwithoutdeathpenalty  march
__label__0 it remains to be seen whether this gradual trend toward the elimination of the death penalty by the states will continue  or whether the supreme court will eventually decide to follow former justice harry blackmun s decision to  no longer  tinker with the machinery of death  and abolish it completely
__label__0 we saw above that james madison and the other framers were aware they might endanger some rights if they listed a few in the constitution and omitted others
__label__0 to ensure that those interpreting the constitution would recognize that the listing of freedoms and rights in the bill of rights was not exhaustive  the ninth amendment states
__label__1 although the term privacy does not appear in the constitution or bill of rights  scholars have interpreted several bill of rights provisions as an indication that james madison and congress sought to protect a common  law right to privacy as it would have been understood in the late eighteenth century  a right to be free of government intrusion into our personal life  particularly within the bounds of the home
__label__0 for example  we could perhaps see the second amendment as standing for the common  law right to self  defense in the home  the third amendment as a statement that government soldiers should not be housed in anyone s home  the fourth amendment as setting a high legal standard for allowing agents of the state to intrude on someone s home  and the due process and takings clauses of the fifth amendment as applying an equally high legal standard to the government s taking a home or property  reinforced after the civil war by the fourteenth amendment
__label__0 starting in the s  supreme court justices appointed by republican presidents began to roll back the roe decision
__label__1 a key turning point was the court s ruling in planned parenthood v casey in   in which a plurality of the court rejected roe s framework based on trimesters of pregnancy and replaced it with the undue burden test  which allows restrictions prior to viability that are not  substantial obstacles    undue burdens  to women seeking an abortion
__label__0 planned parenthood v casey   us
__label__0 thus  the court upheld some state restrictions  including a required waiting period between arranging and having an abortion  parental consent  or  if not possible for some reason such as incest  authorization of a judge  for minors  and the requirement that women be informed of the health consequences of having an abortion
__label__0 other restrictions such as a requirement that a married woman notify her spouse prior to an abortion were struck down as an undue burden
__label__0 in the united states  many advocates of civil liberties are concerned that laws such as the usa patriot act  ie  uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act   passed weeks after the  attacks in   have given the federal government too much power by making it easy for officials to seek and obtain search warrants or  in some cases  to bypass warrant requirements altogether
__label__0 critics have argued that the patriot act has largely been used to prosecute ordinary criminals  in particular drug dealers  rather than terrorists as intended
__label__0 most european countries  at least on paper  have opted for laws that protect against such government surveillance  perhaps mindful of past experience with communist and fascist regimes
__label__0 unless the person or group challenging the law can prove otherwise  the courts will generally decide the discriminatory practice is allowed
__label__0 in these cases  the courts are applying the rational basis test
__label__1 that is  as long as there s a reason for treating some people differently that is  rationally related to a legitimate government interest   the discriminatory act or law or policy is acceptable
__label__0 cornell university law school  legal information institute
__label__0 discrimination against members of racial  ethnic  or religious groups or those of various national origins is reviewed to the greatest degree by the courts  which apply the strict scrutiny standard in these cases
__label__0 under strict scrutiny  the burden of proof is on the government to demonstrate that there is a compelling governmental interest in treating people from one group differently from those who are not part of that group  the law or action can be  narrowly tailored  to achieve the goal in question  and that it is the  least restrictive means  available to achieve that goal
__label__0 johnson v california   us
__label__0 in other words  if there is a non  discriminatory way to accomplish the goal in question  discrimination should not take place
__label__0 to override the southern states  actions  lawmakers in congress proposed two amendments to the constitution designed to give political equality and power to former slaves  once passed by congress and ratified by the necessary number of states  these became the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments
__label__0 the fourteenth amendment  in addition to including the equal protection clause as noted above  also was designed to ensure that the states would respect the civil liberties of freed slaves
__label__0 the fifteenth amendment was proposed to ensure the right to vote for black men  which will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter
__label__0 in the declaration of independence  thomas jefferson made the radical statement that  all men are created equal  and  are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights  that among these are life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness
__label__0 yet like other wealthy landowners of his time  jefferson also owned dozens of other human beings as his personal property

__label__0 as part of this process  the republican party pushed for a permanent end to slavery
__label__0 a constitutional amendment to this effect was passed by the house of representatives in january   after having already been approved by the senate in april   and it was ratified in december  as the thirteenth amendment
__label__0 the amendment s first section states   neither slavery nor involuntary servitude  except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted  shall exist within the united states  or any place subject to their jurisdiction

__label__0 ibid
__label__0 beyond these favorable court rulings  however  progress toward equality for african americans remained slow in the s
__label__1 in   congress proposed what later became the twenty  fourth amendment  which banned the poll tax in elections to federal  but not state or local  office  the amendment went into effect after being ratified in early
__label__1 several southern states continued to require residents to pay poll taxes in order to vote in state elections until  when  in the case of harper v virginia board of elections  the supreme court declared that requiring payment of a poll tax in order to vote in an election at any level was unconstitutional
__label__0 harper v virginia board of elections   us
__label__0 newer  grassroots organizations such as the southern christian leadership conference  sclc   congress of racial equality  core   and student non  violent coordinating committee  sncc  challenged the naacp s position as the leading civil rights organization and questioned its legal  focused strategy
__label__0 these newer groups tended to prefer more confrontational approaches  including the use of direct action campaigns relying on marches and demonstrations
__label__0 the strategies of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience  or the refusal to obey an unjust law  had been effective in the campaign led by mahatma gandhi to liberate colonial india from british rule in the s and s
__label__1 direct action also took such forms as the sit  in campaigns to desegregate lunch counters that began in greensboro  north carolina  in   and the  freedom rides in which black and white volunteers rode buses and trains through the south to enforce a  supreme court decision that desegregated interstate transportation  morgan v virginia
__label__0 morgan v virginia   us
__label__0 while such focused campaigns could be effective  they often had little impact in places where they were not replicated
__label__0 in addition  some of the campaigns led to violence against both the campaigns  leaders and ordinary people  rosa parks  a longtime naacp member and graduate of the highlander folk school for civil rights activists  whose actions had begun the montgomery boycott  received death threats  e d nixon s home was bombed  and the freedom riders were attacked in alabama
__label__0 see lynne olson
__label__0 literacy and understanding tests  and other devices used to discriminate against voters on the basis of race  were banned
__label__0 the voting rights act proved to have much more immediate and dramatic effect than the laws that preceded it  what had been a fairly slow process of improving voter registration and participation was replaced by a rapid increase of black voter registration rates  although white registration rates increased over this period as well
__label__0 keyssar
__label__0 to many people s way of thinking  however  the supreme court turned back the clocks when it gutted a core aspect of the voting rights act in shelby county v holder

__label__0 no longer would states need federal approval to change laws and policies related to voting
__label__0 indeed  many states with a history of voter discrimination quickly resumed restrictive practices with laws requiring photo id and limiting early voting
__label__1 one of the major controversies regarding race in the united states today is related to affirmative action  the practice of ensuring that members of historically disadvantaged or underrepresented groups have equal access to opportunities in education  the workplace  and government contracting

__label__1 many women were active in these causes  especially the abolition movement and the temperance movement  which tried to end the excessive consumption of liquor
__label__0 they often found they were hindered in their efforts  however  either by the law or by widely held beliefs that they were weak  silly creatures who should leave important issues to men
__label__0 keyssar
__label__0 one of the leaders of the early women s movement  elizabeth cady stanton   link    was shocked and angered when she sought to attend an  antislavery meeting in london  only to learn that women would not be allowed to participate and had to sit apart from the men

__label__1 at the seneca falls convention  stanton wrote the declaration of sentiments  which was modeled after the declaration of independence and proclaimed women were equal to men and deserved the same rights
__label__0 among the rights stanton wished to see granted to women was suffrage  the right to vote
__label__0 a second women s rights movement emerged in the s to address these problems
__label__1 title vii of the civil rights act of  prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of sex as well as race  color  national origin  and religion

__label__1 at the same time that our beliefs and attitudes are forming during childhood  we are also being socialized  that is  we are learning from many information sources about the society and community in which we live and how we are to behave in it
__label__1 political socialization is the process by which we are trained to understand and join a country s political world  and  like most forms of socialization  it starts when we are very young
__label__0 we may first become aware of politics by watching a parent or guardian vote  for instance  or by hearing presidents and candidates speak on television or the internet  or seeing adults honor the american flag at an event   link
__label__1 an agent of political socialization is a source of political information intended to help citizens understand how to act in their political system and how to make decisions on political matters
__label__0 the information may help a citizen decide how to vote  where to donate money  or how to protest decisions made by the government

__label__0 from design to implementation  polls are complex and require careful planning and care
__label__0 mitt romney s campaign polls are only a recent example of problems stemming from polling methods
__label__0 our history is littered with examples of polling companies producing results that incorrectly predicted public opinion due to poor survey design or bad polling methods

__label__0 more recently  john zogby  of zogby analytics  went public with his prediction that john kerry would win the presidency against incumbent president george w bush in   only to be proven wrong on election night
__label__0 these are just a few cases  but each offers a different lesson
__label__0 when the sample represents the actual population  the poll s accuracy will be reflected in a lower margin of error
__label__1 the margin of error is a number that states how far the poll results may be from the actual opinion of the total population of citizens
__label__0 the lower the margin of error  the more predictive the poll
__label__1 many polling companies try to avoid leading questions  which lead respondents to select a predetermined answer  because they want to know what people really think
__label__0 some polls  however  have a different goal
__label__0 respondents may not know that much about the polling topic but are unwilling to say   i do nt know
__label__0 for this reason  surveys may contain a quiz with questions that determine whether the respondent knows enough about the situation to answer survey questions accurately
__label__0 a poll to discover whether citizens support changes to the affordable care act or medicaid might first ask who these programs serve and how they are funded

__label__0 states and counties on the preclearance list were released  and congress was told to design new guidelines for placing states on the list
__label__0 finally  some voters may view non  voting as a means of social protest or may see volunteering as a better way to spend their time
__label__0 younger voters are more likely to volunteer their time rather than vote  believing that serving others is more important than voting

__label__0 possibly related to this choice is voter fatigue
__label__0 in many states  due to our federal structure with elections at many levels of government  voters may vote many times per year on ballots filled with candidates and issues to research
__label__0 the history of campaign finance monitoring has its roots in a federal law written in   which prohibited government employees from asking naval yard employees for donations

__label__0 jonathan bernstein   they spent what on presidential campaigns    washington post   february
__label__0 this raised enough eyebrows that several key politicians  including theodore roosevelt  took note

__label__1 shortly after  the tillman act    was passed by congress  which prohibited corporations from contributing money to candidates running in federal elections
__label__0 other congressional acts followed  limiting how much money individuals could contribute to candidates  how candidates could spend contributions  and what information would be disclosed to the public
__label__0 federal corrupt practices act of   hatch act of   taft  hartley act of
__label__0 by using loopholes in the laws  political parties and political action committees donated large sums of money to candidates  and new reforms were soon needed
__label__0 senators john mccain  r  az  and russ feingold  former d  wi  cosponsored the bipartisan campaign reform act of   bcra   also referred to as the mccain  feingold act
__label__1 mccain  feingold restricts the amount of money given to political parties  which had become a way for companies and pacs to exert influence
__label__0 the court ruling also allowed corporations to place unlimited money into super pacs  or independent expenditure  only committees
__label__0 these organizations can not contribute directly to a candidate  nor can they strategize with a candidate s campaign
__label__0 senator or house member  some states use the top  two primary method
__label__1 a top  two primary  sometimes called a jungle primary  pits all candidates against each other  regardless of party affiliation
__label__0 the two candidates with the most votes become the final candidates for the general election
__label__0 it was  however  one of the worst occurrences
__label__0 states have been frontloading since the  presidential election  with the problem becoming more severe in the  election and later
__label__0 josh putnam   presidential primaries and caucuses by month      frontloading hq  blog   february     httpfrontloadingblogspotcompresidentialprimarycalendarhtml
__label__0 the general election campaign period occurs between mid  august and early november
__label__0 these elections are simpler than primaries and conventions  because there are only two major party candidates and a few minor party candidates
__label__1 in forty  eight states and the district of columbia  the candidate who wins the most votes in november receives all the state s electoral votes  and only the electors from that party will vote
__label__0 this is often called the winner  take  all system
__label__0 in two states  nebraska and maine  the electoral votes are divided
__label__1 during a presidential election year  members of congress often experience the coattail effect  which gives members of a popular presidential candidate s party an increase in popularity and raises their odds of retaining office
__label__0 during a midterm election year  however  the president s party often is blamed for the president s actions or inaction
__label__0 there are more candidates vying to become their party s nominee  and party identification is not a useful cue because each party has many candidates rather than just one
__label__0 in the  presidential election  republican voters in the early primaries were presented with a number of options  including mike huckabee  donald trump  jeb bush  ted cruz  marco rubio  john kasich  chris christie  carly fiorina  ben carson  and more
__label__0 huckabee  christie  and fiorina dropped out relatively early
__label__0 another source of negative ads is from groups outside the campaigns
__label__0 sometimes  shadow campaigns  run by political action committees and other organizations without the coordination or guidance of candidates  also use negative ads to reach voters
__label__0 even before the citizens united decision allowed corporations and interest groups to run ads supporting candidates  shadow campaigns existed
__label__0 over time  however  ads became more negative and manipulative
__label__0 in reaction  the bipartisan campaign reform act of   or mccain  feingold  included a requirement that candidates stand by their ad and include a recorded statement within the ad stating that they approved the message
__label__0 although ads  especially those run by super pacs  continue to be negative  candidates can no longer dodge responsibility for them
__label__0 in essence  this is retrospective voting  but it requires little of the voter
__label__1 in congressional and local elections  incumbents win reelection up to  percent of the time  a result called the incumbency advantage
__label__0 what contributes to this advantage and often persuades competent challengers not to run
__label__1 finally  the recall is one of the more unusual forms of direct democracy  it allows voters to decide whether to remove a government official from office
__label__0 all states have ways to remove officials  but removal by voters is less common
__label__0 first  while citizens of these states believe smoking or consuming marijuana should be legal  the us government does not
__label__1 the controlled substances act  csa   passed by congress in   declares marijuana a dangerous drug and makes its sale a prosecutable act

__label__0 democratic primary candidate bernie sanders arrived in seattle on august     to give a speech at a rally to promote his presidential campaign
__label__0 instead  the rally was interrupted  and eventually co  opted  by activists for black lives matter   link
__label__0 dan merica   black lives matter protesters shut down sanders event in seattle   cnn   august
__label__0 why did the group risk alienating democratic voters by preventing sanders from speaking
__label__0 the work of the news media differs from public relations  which is communication carried out to improve the image of companies  organizations  or candidates for office
__label__0 public relations is not a neutral information form
__label__0 walter cronkite  reporting from vietnam  had a loyal following
__label__0 in a broadcast following the tet offensive in   cronkite expressed concern that the united states was mired in a conflict that would end in a stalemate
__label__0 walter cronkite s  we are mired in stalemate  broadcast  february     digital history  httpwwwdigitalhistoryuhedu  activelearning  explorations  vietnam  cronkitecfm  november
__label__0 his coverage was based on opinion after viewing the war from the ground
__label__0 joel achenbach   cronkite and vietnam   washington post   may
__label__0 although the number of people supporting the war had dwindled by this time  cronkite s commentary bolstered opposition
__label__1 the tabloid  style paper included editorial pages  cartoons  and pictures  while the front  page news was sensational and scandalous
__label__0 this style of coverage became known as yellow journalism
__label__0 she also wrote a newspaper column and had a weekly radio show
__label__0 her immediate successors returned to the less visible role held by her predecessors  although in the early s  jacqueline kennedy gained attention for her efforts to refurbish the white house along historical lines  and lady bird johnson in the mid and late s endorsed an effort to beautify public spaces and highways in the united states
__label__0 she also established the foundations of what came to be known as the office of the first lady  complete with a news reporter  liz carpenter  as her press secretary
__label__0 she shared with the public the news of her breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent mastectomy
__label__0 her successor  rosalynn carter  attended several cabinet meetings and pushed for the ratification of the era as well as for legislation addressing mental health issues   link
__label__0 the public role of the first lady reach a new level with hillary clinton in the s when her husband put her in charge of his efforts to achieve health care reform  a controversial decision that did not meet with political success
__label__0 her successors  laura bush in the first decade of the twenty  first century and michelle obama in the second  returned to the roles played by predecessors in advocating less controversial policies  laura bush advocated literacy and education  while michelle obama has emphasized physical fitness and healthy diet and exercise
__label__0 nevertheless  the public and political profiles of first ladies remain high  and in the future  the president s spouse will have the opportunity to use that unelected position to advance policies that might well be less controversial and more appealing than those pushed by the president
__label__0 the president may not be able to appoint key members of his or her administration without senate confirmation  but he or she can demand the resignation or removal of cabinet officers  high  ranking appointees  such as ambassadors   and members of the presidential staff
__label__0 during reconstruction  congress tried to curtail the president s removal power with the tenure of office act     which required senate concurrence to remove presidential nominees who took office upon senate confirmation
__label__0 andrew johnson s violation of that legislation provided the grounds for his impeachment in
__label__0 many of the most famous executive orders have come in times of war or invoke the president s authority as commander  in  chief  including franklin roosevelt s order permitting the internment of japanese americans in  and harry truman s directive desegregating the armed forces
__label__1 the most famous presidential proclamation was abraham lincoln s emancipation proclamation     which declared slaves in areas under confederate control to be free  with a few exceptions
__label__0 finally  presidents have also used the line  item veto and signing statements to alter or influence the application of the laws they sign
__label__1 a line  item veto is a type of veto that keeps the majority of a spending bill unaltered but nullifies certain lines of spending within it
__label__0 while a number of states allow their governors the line  item veto  discussed in the chapter on state and local government   the president acquired this power only in  after congress passed a law permitting it
__label__0 but the advent of civil service reform in the s systematically deprived presidents of that option and reduced its scope and effectiveness
__label__0 although the president may call upon various agencies for assistance in lobbying for proposals  such as the office of legislative liaison with congress  it is often left to the chief executive to offer incentives and rewards
__label__0 some of these are symbolic  like private meetings in the white house or an appearance on the campaign trail
__label__0 nor is this impact limited to chief executives deemed successful  lyndon johnson s vietnam and richard nixon s watergate offered cautionary tales of presidential power gone wrong  leaving behind legacies that include terms like vietnam syndrome and the tendency to add the suffix  gate  to scandals and controversies
__label__0 the youth and glamour that john f kennedy and first lady jacqueline brought to the white house in the early s  a  helped give rise to the legend of  one brief shining moment that was camelot  after kennedy s presidency was cut short by his assassination on november
__label__0 despite a tainted legacy  president richard nixon gives his trademark  v for victory  sign as he leaves the white house on august     b   after resigning in the wake of the watergate scandal
__label__0 it distinguishes which are matters of original jurisdiction and which are for appellate jurisdiction
__label__1 under original jurisdiction  a case is heard for the first time  whereas under appellate jurisdiction  a court hears a case on appeal from a lower court and may change the lower court s decision
__label__0 the constitution also limits the supreme court s original jurisdiction to those rare cases of disputes between states  or between the united states and foreign ambassadors or ministers
__label__0 the first session of the first us congress laid the framework for today s federal judicial system  established in the judiciary act of
__label__0 although legislative changes over the years have altered it  the basic structure of the judicial branch remains as it was set early on  at the lowest level are the district courts  where federal cases are tried  witnesses testify  and evidence and arguments are presented
__label__0 but it took years for the court to get to that point  and it faced a number of setbacks on the way to such recognition
__label__0 in their first case of significance  chisholm v georgia     the justices ruled that the federal courts could hear cases brought by a citizen of one state against a citizen of another state  and that article iii  section   of the constitution did not protect the states from facing such an interstate lawsuit
__label__0 chisholm v georgia   us
__label__0 however  their decision was almost immediately overturned by the eleventh amendment  passed by congress in  and ratified by the states in
__label__0 in protecting the states  the eleventh amendment put a prohibition on the courts by stating   the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity  commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state  or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state
__label__0 it was an early hint that congress had the power to change the jurisdiction of the courts as it saw fit and stood ready to use it
__label__0 in an atmosphere of perceived weakness  the first chief justice  john jay  an author of the federalist papers and appointed by president george washington  resigned his post to become governor of new york and later declined president john adams s offer of a subsequent term
__label__0 associated press
__label__0 the supreme court found itself in the middle of a dispute between the outgoing presidential administration of john adams and that of incoming president  and opposition party member  thomas jefferson
__label__0 it was an interesting circumstance at the time  particularly because jefferson and the man who would decide the case  john marshall  were themselves political rivals
__label__0 with each aca case it has decided  the supreme court has served as the umpire  upholding the law and some of its provisions on one hand  but ruling some aspects of it unconstitutional on the other
__label__0 both supporters and opponents of the law have claimed victory and faced defeat
__label__0 societal traditions  public opinion  and politics have often stood in the way of the full expansion of rights and liberties to different groups  and not everyone has agreed that these rights should be expanded as they have been by the courts
__label__0 schools were long segregated by race until the court ordered desegregation in brown v board of education     and even then  many stood in opposition and tried to block students at the entrances to all  white schools
__label__0 brown v board of education of topeka   us
__label__0 factions have formed on opposite sides of the abortion and handgun debates  because many do not agree that women should have abortion rights or that individuals should have the right to a handgun
__label__0 people disagree about whether members of the lgbt community should be allowed to marry or whether arrested persons should be read their rights  guaranteed an attorney  andor have their cell phones protected from police search
__label__0 brown v board of education
__label__0 state courts really are the core of the us judicial system  and they are responsible for a huge area of law
__label__0 most crimes and criminal activity  such as robbery  rape  and murder  are violations of state laws  and cases are thus heard by state courts
__label__0 state courts also handle civil matters  personal injury  malpractice  divorce  family  juvenile  probate  and contract disputes and real estate cases  to name just a few  are usually state  level cases
__label__0 from an individual s perspective  the dual court system has both benefits and drawbacks
__label__0 on the plus side  each person has more than just one court system ready to protect his or her rights
__label__0 today s federal court system was not an overnight creation  it has been changing and transitioning for more than two hundred years through various acts of congress
__label__0 since district courts are not called for in article iii of the constitution  congress established them and narrowly defined their jurisdiction  at first limiting them to handling only cases that arose within the district
__label__0 certainly  court interpretations can change as times and circumstances change  and as the courts themselves change when new judges are selected and take their place on the bench
__label__0 for example  the membership of the supreme court had changed entirely between plessey v ferguson     which brought the doctrine of  separate but equal  and brown v board of education     which required integration
__label__0 plessy v ferguson   us      brown v board of education of topeka   us
__label__0 president obama has made two appointments to the us supreme court  justices sonia sotomayor  a  in  and elena kagan  b  in
__label__0 since their appointments  both justices have made rulings consistent with a more liberal ideology
__label__0 republican dwight d eisenhower reportedly called his nomination of earl warren as chief justice  in an era that saw substantial broadening of civil and criminal rights   the biggest damn fool mistake  he had ever made
__label__0 sandra day oconnor  nominated by republican president ronald reagan  often became a champion for women s rights
__label__0 david souter  nominated by republican george h w bush  more often than not sided with the court s liberal wing
__label__0 miers  under fire from right  withdrawn as court nominee   washington post   october   httpwwwwashingtonpostcomwpdyncontentarticlearhtml
__label__0 after miers  withdrawal  the senate went on to confirm bush s subsequent nomination of samuel alito  who remains on the court today
__label__0 the  presidential election between hillary clinton and donald trump was especially important because the next president is likely to choose three justices
__label__0 presidential nominations to the supreme court sometimes go awry  as illustrated by the failed nominations of robert bork  a   douglas ginsburg  b   and harriet miers  c
__label__0 with the death of associate justice antonin scalia in february   there remain three current justices who are considered part of the court s more conservative wing  chief justice roberts and associate justices thomas and alito  while four are considered more liberal  leaning  justices ginsburg  breyer  sotomayor  and kagan   link
__label__0 justice kennedy has become known as the  swing  vote  particularly on decisions like the court s same  sex marriage rulings in   because he sometimes takes a more liberal position and sometimes a more conservative one
__label__0 the supreme court begins its annual session on the first monday in october and ends late the following june
__label__1 every year  there are literally thousands of people who would like to have their case heard before the supreme court  but the justices will select only a handful to be placed on the docket  which is the list of cases scheduled on the court s calendar
__label__0 case names  written in italics  list the name of a petitioner versus a respondent  as in roe v wade  for example  roe v wade   us
__label__0 for a case on appeal  you can tell which party lost at the lower level of court by looking at the case name  the party unhappy with the decision of the lower court is the one bringing the appeal and is thus the petitioner  or the first  named party in the case
__label__0 for example  in brown v board of education     oliver brown was one of the thirteen parents who brought suit against the topeka public schools for discrimination based on racial segregation
__label__0 examples of conflicts include    conflicting decisions among different courts of appeals on the same matter     decisions by an appeals court or a state court conflicting with precedent  and    state court decisions that conflict with federal decisions
__label__0 occasionally  the court will fast  track a case that has special urgency  such as bush v gore in the wake of the  election  bush v gore   us
__label__0 past research indicated that the amount of interest  group activity surrounding a case before it is granted cert has a significant impact on whether the supreme court puts the case on its agenda
__label__0 the more activity  the more likely the case will be placed on the docket
__label__0 gregory a caldeira and john r wright
__label__0 on june     supporters of marriage equality in front of the us supreme court building eagerly await the announcement of a decision in the case of obergefell v hodges
__label__0 credit  matt popovich
__label__0 critics of the judiciary often deride activist courts for involving themselves too heavily in matters they believe are better left to the elected legislative and executive branches
__label__0 however  as justice anthony kennedy has said   an activist court is a court that makes a decision you do nt like

__label__0 president franklin d roosevelt even attempted to stack the odds in his favor in   with a  court  packing scheme  in which he tried to get a bill passed through congress that would have reorganized the judiciary and enabled him to appoint up to six additional judges to the high court   link
__label__0 the bill never passed  but other presidents have also been accused of trying similar moves at different courts in the federal system
__label__0 who remarked that the courts had  neither force nor will  but merely judgment
__label__0 and even years later  when the  supreme court ruled the state of georgia s seizing of native american lands unconstitutional  worcester v georgia   us   pet
__label__0 
__label__0 president andrew jackson is reported to have said   john marshall has made his decision  now let him enforce it   and the court s ruling was basically ignored
__label__0 court history   supreme court history  the first hundred years  httpwwwpbsorgwnetsupremecourtantebellumhistoryhtml  march
__label__0 abraham lincoln  too  famously ignored chief justice roger b
__label__0 for example  in   president dwight d eisenhower called out the military by executive order to enforce the supreme court s order to racially integrate the public schools in little rock  arkansas
__label__0 eisenhower told the nation   whenever normal agencies prove inadequate to the task and it becomes necessary for the executive branch of the federal government to use its powers and authority to uphold federal courts  the president s responsibility is inescapable
__label__0 dwight d eisenhower
__label__1 ultimately  the framers settled on a system in which power would be shared  the national government had its core duties  the state governments had their duties  and other duties were shared equally between them
__label__0 today this structure of power sharing is referred to as federalism
__label__1 in addition to these expressed powers  the national government was given implied powers that  while not clearly stated  are inferred
__label__0 these powers stem from the elastic clause in article i  section   of the constitution  which provides congress the authority  to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers
__label__0 this statement has been used to support the federal government s playing a role in controversial policy matters  such as the provision of healthcare  the expansion of power to levy and collect taxes  and regulation of interstate commerce
__label__0 despite the national government s power to pass and fund policy that affects lower  level governments  states still have gained considerable headway since the late twentieth century
__label__1 for instance  with the passage of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act in   known as the welfare reform bill  states were given great discretion over the provision of welfare
__label__0 the federal government reduced its level of monetary support for the program and  in exchange  the states gained more authority over its implementation
__label__0 property taxes can be assessed on homes  land  and businesses
__label__0 the local government s reliance on property tax revenue can be problematic for a number of reasons
__label__0 first  unlike sales tax  the collection of which is spaced out in small increments across multiple transactions  property tax is collected in one or two lump sums and is therefore highly visible and unpopular
__label__0 charles e gilliland
__label__0 in elazar s framework  states with a moralistic political culture see the government as a means to better society and promote the general welfare
__label__0 they expect political officials to be honest in their dealings with others  put the interests of the people they serve above their own  and commit to improving the area they represent
__label__0 according to elazar  the individualist political culture originated with settlers from non  puritan england and germany
__label__0 the first settlements were in the mid  atlantic region of new york  pennsylvania  and new jersey and diffused into the middle portion of the united states in a fairly straight line from ohio to wyoming
__label__0 elazar associates traditionalistic political culture with the southern portion of the united states  where it developed in the upper regions of virginia and kentucky before spreading to the deep south and the southwest
__label__1 like the individualistic culture  the traditionalistic culture believes in the importance of the individual
__label__0 three of the governor s chief functions are to influence the legislative process through an executive budget proposal  a policy agenda  and vetoes
__label__0 just as the president gives a state of the union address once a year  so too do governors give an annual state of the state address before the state legislature   link
__label__1 in this speech  they discuss economic and political achievements  cite data that supports their accomplishments  and overview the major items on their legislative agenda

__label__0 the number of bills introduced in any given session varies
__label__0 some state legislatures have more restrictive rules concerning the number of bills any one member can sponsor
__label__0 legislators get ideas for bills from lobbyists of various types of interest groups  ranging from corporate groups to labor unions to advocacy organizations
__label__0 according to the national conference of state legislatures  at forty members  alaska s is the smallest state  or lower  house  while new hampshire s is the largest at four hundred
__label__0 state senates range in size from twenty members in alaska to sixty  seven members in minnesota
__label__1 term limits restrict the length of time a member can serve in the state legislature by capping either lifetime service or the number of consecutive terms
__label__0 the term limits movement gained momentum in the s  spreading across a wide array of state legislative institutions

__label__1 under the council  administrator system  the voters elect council members to serve for a specified period of time  and the council in turn appoints an administrator to oversee the operation of the government
__label__0 the administrator serves at the directive of the council and can be terminated by the council
__label__1 under the mayor  council system voters elect both a mayor and members of the city council
__label__0 the city council performs legislative functions and the mayor the executive functions
__label__0 indeed  it grew so large that politicians in modern times have ridiculed it to great political advantage
__label__1 however  the country s many bureaucrats or civil servants  the individuals who work in the bureaucracy  fill necessary and even instrumental roles in every area of government  from high  level positions in foreign affairs and intelligence collection agencies to clerks and staff in the smallest regulatory agencies
__label__0 they are hired  or sometimes appointed  for their expertise in carrying out the functions and programs of the government
__label__0 for example  article ii  section   provides the president the power to appoint officers and department heads
__label__0 in the following section  the president is further empowered to see that the laws are  faithfully executed
__label__0 more specifically  article i  section   empowers congress to establish a post office  build roads  regulate commerce  coin money  and regulate the value of money

__label__0 while the bureaucracies created in these two periods served important purposes  many at that time and even now argue that the expansion came with unacceptable costs  particularly economic costs
__label__0 the common argument that bureaucratic regulation smothers capitalist innovation was especially powerful in the cold war environment of the s  s  and s
__label__0 but as long as voters felt they were benefiting from the bureaucratic expansion  as they typically did  the political winds supported continued growth
__label__0 as the size of the federal government and its bureaucracy grew following the great depression and the roosevelt reforms  many became increasingly concerned that the pendleton act prohibitions on political activities by civil servants were no longer strong enough
__label__0 as a result of these mounting concerns  congress passed the hatch act of   or the political activities act
__label__1 the main provision of this legislation prohibits bureaucrats from actively engaging in political campaigns and from using their federal authority via bureaucratic rank to influence the outcomes of nominations and elections
__label__0 civil servants receive pay based on the us federal general schedule
__label__1 a pay schedule is a chart that shows salary ranges for different levels  grades  of positions vertically and for different ranks  steps  of seniority horizontally

__label__0 on march     both chambers of congress passed the health care and education reconciliation act  hcera
__label__0 h r   health care and education reconciliation act of    httpswwwcongressgovbillthcongresshousebill  march
__label__0 the story of the hcera  which expanded and improved some provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act  aca   also known as obamacare  is a complicated tale of insider politics in which the democratic party was able to enact sweeping health care and higher education reforms over fierce republican opposition   link
__label__0 some people laud the hcera as an example of getting things done in the face of partisan gridlock in congress  others see it a case of government power run amok
__label__1 the president can also implement or change policy through an executive order  which offers instructions about how to implement law under his or her discretion   link
__label__1 finally  policy changes can come as a result of court actions or opinions  such as brown v board of education of topeka     which formally ended school segregation in the united states
__label__0 brown v board of education of topeka   us
__label__0 during the great depression of the s  the united states created a set of policies and programs that constituted a social safety net for the millions who had lost their jobs  their homes  and their savings   link
__label__0 under president franklin delano roosevelt  the federal government began programs like the work progress administration and civilian conservation corps to combat unemployment and the home owners  loan corporation to refinance depression  related mortgage debts
__label__0 as the effects of the depression eased  the government phased out many of these programs
__label__0 some people in the united states argue that the self  monitoring and self  regulating incentives provided by the existence of private goods mean that sound public policy requires very little government action
__label__1 known as libertarians  these individuals believe government almost always operates less efficiently than the private sector  the segment of the economy run for profit and not under government control   and that government actions should therefore be kept to a minimum
__label__0 by the beginning of the twentieth century  led by the progressives  the united states had begun to search for ways to govern large businesses that had managed to distort market forces by monopolizing the supply of goods
__label__0 and  largely as a result of the great depression  people wanted ways of developing and protecting public goods that were fairer and more equitable than had existed before
__label__0 these forces and events led to the increased regulation of public and common goods  and a move for the public sector  the government  to take over of the provision of many toll goods
__label__0 however  in   senator hiram johnson and representative phil swing  both republicans from california  won the day
__label__0 congress passed the boulder canyon project act  authorizing the construction of one of the most ambitious engineering feats in us history
__label__0 the hoover dam   link    completed in   served the dual purposed of generating hydroelectric power and irrigating two million acres of land from the resulting reservoir  lake mead
__label__0 the jungle  new york  grosset and dunlap
__label__0 this work and others like it helped to spur the passage of the pure food and drug act    and ultimately led to the creation of government agencies such as the us food and drug administration  fdahttpwwwfdagov  aboutfda  whatwedo  history  march
__label__0 the nation s experiences during the depression of  and the great depression of the s also led to more robust regulatory policies designed to improve the transparency of financial markets and prevent monopolies from forming
__label__0 by the s  social welfare had become a major function of the federal government  one to which most public policy funds are devoted  and had developed to serve several overlapping functions
__label__1 first  social welfare policy is designed to ensure some level of equity in a democratic political system based on competitive  free  market economics
__label__0 during the great depression  many politicians came to fear that the high unemployment and low  income levels plaguing society could threaten the stability of democracy  as was happening in european countries like germany and italy
__label__0 social security addresses these concerns with three important tools
__label__0 first and best known is the retirement benefit
__label__0 while social security was designed to provide cash payments to sustain the aged and disabled  medicare and medicaid were intended to ensure that vulnerable populations have access to health care
__label__0 medicare  like social security  is an entitlement program funded through payroll taxes
__label__0 its purpose is to make sure that senior citizens and retirees have access to low  cost health care they might not otherwise have  because most us citizens get their health insurance through their employers
__label__0 one of the reasons the news media are so enduring is that citizens have a range of opinions on public policy  and they are very interested in debating how a given change would improve their lives or the country s
__label__0 but despite their interests  most people do little more than vote or occasionally contribute to a political campaign
__label__0 a few people  however  become policy advocates by actively working to propose or maintain public policy
__label__0 both the congress and the president have tried to reduce the bias in policy analysis by creating their own theoretically nonpartisan policy branches
__label__0 in congress  the best known of these is the congressional budget office  or cbo
__label__0 authorized in the  congressional budget and impoundment control act  the cbo was formally created in  as a way of increasing congress s independence from the executive branch
__label__0 on a national level  policy implementation can be either top  down or bottom  up
__label__1 in top  down implementation  the federal government dictates the specifics of the policy  and each state implements it the same exact way
__label__1 in bottom  up implementation  the federal government allows local areas some flexibility to meet their specific challenges and needs
__label__0 daniel mazmanian and paul sabatier
__label__0 finally  laissez  faire proponents felt that keeping government out of the business of business would create an automatic cycle of economic growth and contraction
__label__1 contraction phases in which there is no economic growth for two consecutive quarters  called recessions  would bring business failures and higher unemployment
__label__0 but this condition  they believed  would correct itself on its own if the government simply allowed the system to operate
__label__0 the desire of keynesians to create a minimal level of aggregate demand  coupled with a depression  era preference to promote social welfare policy  led the president and congress to develop a federal budget with spending divided into two broad categories  mandatory and discretionary  see  link
__label__0 of these  mandatory spending is the larger  consisting of about   trillion of the projected  budget  or roughly  percent of all federal expenditures
__label__0 mandatory spending in   an infographic    january   wwwcbogovpublication  march
__label__0 however  the amount of money the us government needed to borrow to pay its bills in  was still in excess of   billion
__label__0 the federal budget in   an infographic    january   wwwcbogovpublication  march
__label__0 this was in addition to the country s almost   trillion of total debt  the amount of money the government owes its creditors  at the end of   according to the department of the treasury
__label__0 this does not automatically mean the wealthy pay less than the poor  simply that the percentage of their income they pay in taxes will be lower
__label__0 consider  for example  the use of excise taxes on specific goods or services as a source of revenue
__label__0 excise tax   httpswwwirsgovbusinessessmallbusinessesselfemployedexcisetax  march
__label__0 sometimes called  sin taxes  because they tend to be applied to goods like alcohol  tobacco  and gasoline  excise taxes have a regressive quality  since the amount of the good purchased by the consumer  and thus the tax paid  does not increase at the same rate as income
__label__0 a person who makes   per year is likely to purchase more gasoline than a person who makes   per year   link
__label__0 us president barack obama and russian president vladimir putin shake hands for the cameras during the g summit held june       at lough erne in northern ireland
__label__0 
__label__0 a third main goal is the preservation of a balance of power in the world
__label__1 a balance of power means no one nation or region is much more powerful militarily than are the countries of the rest of the world
__label__0 the achievement of a perfect balance of power is probably not possible  but general stability  or predictability in the operation of governments  strong institutions  and the absence of violence within and between nations may be
__label__0 the united nations  un  is perhaps the foremost international organization in the world today
__label__0 the main institutional bodies of the un are the general assembly and the security council
__label__0 another cross  national organization to which the united states is tied  and that exists to forcefully represent western allies and in turn forge the peace  is the north atlantic treaty organization  nato
__label__0 nato was formed after world war ii as the cold war between east and west started to emerge
__label__0 at times the united states has been free trade  oriented  while at other times it has been protectionist
__label__0 perhaps its most free trade  oriented move was the  implementation of the north american free trade agreement  nafta
__label__1 this pact removed trade barriers and other transaction costs levied on goods moving between the united states  mexico  and canada
__label__1 had they not succeeded  an escalating set of options likely would have included diplomatic sanctions  removal of ambassadors   economic sanctions  such as an embargo on trade and the flow of money between the countries   minor military options  such as establishment of a no  fly zone just outside chinese airspace   or more significant military options  such as a focused campaign to enter china and get the pilots back
__label__1 nonmilitary tools to influence another country  like economic sanctions  are referred to as soft power  while the use of military power is termed hard power
__label__0 joseph s nye  jr   soft power  the means to success in world politics  washington  dc  public affairs

__label__0 the narratives and visual arts of these realists could nonetheless be highly stylized  crafted  and even fabricated  since their goal was the effective portrayal of social realities they thought required reform
__label__1 some authors  such as jack london  who wrote the call of the wild  embraced a school of thought called naturalism  which concluded that the laws of nature and the natural world were the only truly relevant laws governing humanity   link

__label__0 the cover of jack london s the call of the wild  b  shows the dogs in the brutal environment of the klondike
__label__1 the campaign was a typical one for the era  democrats shone a spotlight on earlier republican scandals  such as the crdit mobilier affair  and republicans relied upon the bloody shirt campaign  reminding the nation of the terrible human toll of the war against southern confederates who now reappeared in national politics under the mantle of the democratic party
__label__0 president grant previously had great success with the  bloody shirt  strategy in the  election  when republican supporters attacked democratic candidate horatio seymour for his sympathy with new york city draft rioters during the war
__label__0 with his efforts towards ensuring african american civil rights stymied by a democratic congress  and his decision to halt the coinage of silver merely adding to the pressures of the economic panic of   hayes failed to achieve any significant legislation during his presidency
__label__0 however  he did make a few overtures towards civil service reform
__label__1 at the state level  specifically in wisconsin  minnesota  illinois  and iowa  the patrons of husbandry did briefly succeed in urging the passage of granger laws  which regulated some railroad rates along with the prices charged by grain elevator operators
__label__1 the movement also created a political party  the greenback party  so named for its support of print currency  or  greenbacks   not based upon a gold standard  which saw brief success with the election of fifteen congressmen
__label__1 the movement also created a political party  the greenback party  so named for its support of print currency  or  greenbacks   not based upon a gold standard  which saw brief success with the election of fifteen congressmen
__label__0 however  such successes were short  lived and had little impact on the lives of everyday farmers
__label__0 the causes of the depression of  were manifold  but one major element was the speculation in railroads over the previous decades
__label__0 the rapid proliferation of railroad lines created a false impression of growth for the economy as a whole
__label__0 beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century  these progressive journalists sought to expose critical social problems and exhort the public to take action
__label__0 in his book  how the other half lives     journalist and photographer jacob riis used photojournalism to capture the dismal and dangerous living conditions in working  class tenements in new york city   link
__label__0 ida tarbell  perhaps the most well  known female muckraker  wrote a series of articles on the dangers of john d rockefeller s powerful monopoly  standard oil
__label__0 the first law involved the creation of the direct primary
__label__0 prior to this time  the only people who had a hand in selecting candidates for elections were delegates at conventions
__label__1 during his time as governor  from  through   la follette introduced the wisconsin idea  wherein he hired experts to research and advise him in drafting legislation to improve conditions in his state
__label__0 fighting bob  supported numerous progressive ideas while governor  he signed into law the first workman s compensation system  approved a minimum wage law  developed a progressive tax law  adopted the direct election of us senators before the subsequent constitutional amendment made it mandatory  and advocated for women s suffrage
__label__0 la follette subsequently served as a popular us senator from wisconsin from  through   and ran for president on the progressive party ticket in
__label__0 an energetic speaker and tireless progressive  governor robert  fighting bob  la follette turned the state of wisconsin into a flagship for democratic reform
__label__0 when others in the group were unwilling to move in her direction  paul split from the nawsa to create the congressional union for woman suffrage  later renamed the national woman s party  in
__label__0 known as the silent sentinels   link    paul and her group picketed outside the white house for nearly two years  starting in
__label__0 in the latter stages of their protests  many women  including paul  were arrested and thrown in jail  where they staged a hunger strike as self  proclaimed political prisoners
__label__0 du bois  met in a small hotel on the canadian side of niagara falls  where segregation laws did not bar them from hotel accommodations  to discuss what immediate steps were needed for equal rights   link
__label__0 du bois  a professor at the all  black atlanta university and the first african american with a doctorate from harvard  emerged as the prominent spokesperson for what would later be dubbed the niagara movement
__label__0 by   he had grown wary of booker t washington s calls for african americans to accommodate white racism and focus solely on self  improvement
__label__0 the new president s background suggested he would be a strong administrator
__label__0 he had previously served as the governor of the philippines following the spanish  american war  had a distinguished judicial career  and served as roosevelt s secretary of war from  to
__label__0 republican leaders  however  were anxious to reestablish tighter control over the party after roosevelt s departure  and they left taft little room to maneuver
__label__0 wilson described his more moderate approach as one of new freedom  which stood for a smaller federal government to protect public interests from the evils associated with big businesses and banks
__label__1 roosevelt campaigned on the promise of new nationalism  a charge that he said required a vigorous and powerful federal government to protect public interests
__label__0 he sought to capitalize on the stewardship approach that he had made famous during his previous administration
__label__0 turner   link   and naval strategist alfred thayer mahan were instrumental in the country s move toward foreign expansion  and writer brooks adams further dramatized the consequences of the nation s loss of its frontier in his the law of civilization and decay in
__label__1 as mentioned in the chapter opening  turner announced his frontier thesis  that american democracy was largely formed by the american frontier  at the chicago world s colombian exposition
__label__0 he noted that  for nearly three centuries the dominant fact in american life has been expansion
__label__0 he continued   american energy will continually demand a wider field for its exercise
__label__0 although they initially met with little spanish resistance  by early july  fierce battles ensued near the spanish stronghold in santiago
__label__1 most famously  theodore roosevelt led his rough riders  an all  volunteer cavalry unit made up of adventure  seeking college graduates  and veterans and cowboys from the southwest  in a charge up kettle hill  next to san juan hill  which resulted in american forces surrounding santiago
__label__0 the victories of the rough riders are the best known part of the battles  but in fact  several african american regiments  made up of veteran soldiers  were instrumental to their success
__label__1 in   secretary of state hay made a bold move to acquire china s vast markets for american access by introducing open door notes  a series of circular notes that hay himself drafted as an expression of us interests in the region and sent to the other competing powers   link
__label__0 these notes  if agreed to by the other five nations maintaining spheres of influences in china  would erase all spheres and essentially open all doors to free trade  with no special tariffs or transportation controls that would give unfair advantages to one country over another
__label__0 when william howard taft became president in   he chose to adapt roosevelt s foreign policy philosophy to one that reflected american economic power at the time
__label__1 in what became known as  dollar diplomacy   taft announced his decision to  substitute dollars for bullets  in an effort to use foreign policy to secure markets and opportunities for american businessmen   link
__label__0 not unlike roosevelt s threat of force  taft used the threat of american economic clout to coerce countries into agreements to benefit the united states
__label__0 the final element that led to american involvement in world war i was the so  called zimmermann telegram
__label__1 british intelligence intercepted and decoded a top  secret telegram from german foreign minister arthur zimmermann to the german ambassador to mexico  instructing the latter to invite mexico to join the war effort on the german side  should the united states declare war on germany
__label__0 the court ruled that during a time of war  the federal government was justified in passing such laws to quiet dissenters
__label__0 the decision was unanimous  and in the court s opinion  justice oliver wendell holmes wrote that such dissent presented a  clear and present danger  to the safety of the united states and the military  and was therefore justified
__label__0 he further explained how the first amendment right of free speech did not protect such dissent  in the same manner that a citizen could not be freely permitted to yell  fire   in a crowded theater  due to the danger it presented
__label__1 prohibition  as the anti  alcohol movement became known  had been a goal of many progressives for decades
__label__0 organizations such as the women s christian temperance union and the anti  saloon league linked alcohol consumption with any number of societal problems  and they had worked tirelessly with municipalities and counties to limit or prohibit alcohol on a local scale
__label__0 but on the other side of the political spectrum  interventionists argued that article x would impede the united states from using her rightfully attained military power to secure and protect america s international interests
__label__0 wilson s greatest fight was with the senate  where most republicans opposed the treaty due to the clauses surrounding the creation of the league of nations
__label__1 some republicans  known as irreconcilables  opposed the treaty on all grounds  whereas others  called reservationists  would support the treaty if sufficient amendments were introduced that could eliminate article x
__label__0 in an effort to turn public support into a weapon against those in opposition  wilson embarked on a cross  country railway speaking tour
__label__0 but in the s  as major filmmakers like d w griffith looked to escape the cost of edison s patents on camera equipment  this began to change
__label__1 when griffith filmed in old california     the first movie ever shot in hollywood  california  the small town north of los angeles was little more than a village
__label__0 as moviemakers flocked to southern california  not least because of its favorable climate and predictable sunshine  hollywood swelled with moviemaking activity
__label__0 ford even bought a plot of land in the amazonian jungle twice the size of delaware to build a factory town he called fordlandia
__label__0 workers there rejected his midwestern puritanism even more than his factory discipline  and the project ended in an epic failure
__label__0 town leaders in dayton  tennessee  for their part  sensed an opportunity to promote their town  which had lost more than one  third of its population  and welcomed the aclu to stage a test case against the butler act
__label__0 the aclu and the town got their wish as the scopes monkey trial  as the newspapers publicized it  quickly turned into a carnival that captured the attention of the country and epitomized the nation s urban  rural divide   link
__label__0 the new negro found political expression in a political ideology that celebrated african americans distinct national identity
__label__1 this negro nationalism  as some referred to it  proposed that african americans had a distinct and separate national heritage that should inspire pride and a sense of community
__label__0 an early proponent of such nationalism was w e b
__label__0 they felt alienated from society  so they tried to escape  some literally  to criticize it
__label__0 many lived an expatriate life in paris for the decade  although others went to rome or berlin
__label__0 herbert hoover became president at a time of ongoing prosperity in the country
__label__0 americans hoped he would continue to lead the country through still more economic growth  and neither he nor the country was ready for the unraveling that followed
__label__1 on black tuesday  october   stock holders traded over sixteen million shares and lost over   billion in wealth in a single day
__label__0 to put this in context  a trading day of three million shares was considered a busy day on the stock market
__label__0 hoover believed strongly in the ethos of american individualism  that hard work brought its own rewards
__label__0 his life story testified to that belief
__label__0 one of the most notable protest movements occurred toward the end of hoover s presidency and centered on the bonus expeditionary force  or bonus army  in the spring of
__label__0 in this protest  approximately fifteen thousand world war i veterans marched on washington to demand early payment of their veteran bonuses  which were not due to be paid until
__label__1 in hard  hit oklahoma  thousands of farmers packed up what they could and walked or drove away from the land they thought would be their future
__label__0 they  along with other displaced farmers from throughout the great plains  became known as okies
__label__0 okies were an emblem of the failure of the american breadbasket to deliver on its promise  and their story was made famous in john steinbeck s novel  the grapes of wrath
__label__0 as a result  the global depression worsened further
__label__0 a similar attempt to spur the world economy  known as the hoover moratorium  likewise met with great opposition and little economic benefit
__label__1 issued in   the moratorium called for a halt to world war i reparations to be paid by germany to france  as well as forgiveness of allied war debts to the us
__label__0 his experience in politics had previously included a seat in the new york state legislature  a vice  presidential nomination  and a stint as governor of new york
__label__0 during the latter  he introduced many state  level reforms that later formed the basis of his new deal as well as worked with several advisors who later formed the brains trust that advised his federal agenda
__label__0 within forty  eight hours of his inauguration  roosevelt proclaimed an official bank holiday and called congress into a special session to address the crisis
__label__0 the resulting emergency banking act of  was signed into law on march     a scant eight hours after congress first saw it
__label__1 the law officially took the country off the gold standard  a restrictive practice that  although conservative and traditionally viewed as safe  severely limited the circulation of paper money
__label__1 the law officially took the country off the gold standard  a restrictive practice that  although conservative and traditionally viewed as safe  severely limited the circulation of paper money
__label__0 the biggest threat to the president  however  came from corrupt but beloved louisiana senator huey  kingfish  long   link
__label__0 his disapproval of roosevelt came in part from his own ambitions for higher office  long stated that the president was not doing enough to help people and proposed his own share our wealth program
__label__0 with the implementation of the second new deal  roosevelt also created the country s present  day social safety net
__label__1 the social security act established programs intended to help the most vulnerable  the elderly  the unemployed  the disabled  and the young
__label__0 it included a pension fund for all retired people  except domestic workers and farmers  which therefore left many women and african americans beyond the scope of its benefits  over the age of sixty  five  to be paid through a payroll tax on both employee and employer
__label__0 within his white house  roosevelt had a number of african american appointees  although most were in minor positions
__label__0 unofficially  roosevelt relied upon advice from the federal council on negro affairs  also known as his  black cabinet   this group included a young harvard economist  dr robert weaver  who subsequently became the nation s first black cabinet secretary in   as president lyndon johnson s secretary of housing and urban development
__label__0 aubrey williams  the director of the nya  hired more black administrators than any other federal agency  and appointed them to oversee projects throughout the country
__label__1 in   mussolini created the fasci italiani di combattimento  italian combat squadron
__label__1 the organization s main tenets of fascism called for a totalitarian form of government and a heightened focus on national unity  militarism  social darwinism  and loyalty to the state
__label__0 with the support of major italian industrialists and the king  who saw fascism as a bulwark against growing socialist and communist movements  mussolini became prime minister in
__label__0 by the end of the war  however  manpower needs resulted in african american recruits serving in the infantry and flying planes
__label__0 the tuskegee institute in alabama had instituted a civilian pilot training program for aspiring african american pilots
__label__0 when the war began  the department of war absorbed the program and adapted it to train combat pilots
__label__0 still  there was some resistance to women going to work in such a male  dominated environment
__label__1 in order to recruit women for factory jobs  the government created a propaganda campaign centered on a now  iconic figure known as rosie the riveter   link
__label__0 rosie  who was a composite based on several real women  was most famously depicted by american illustrator norman rockwell
__label__0 japanese americans also suffered from discrimination
__label__0 the japanese attack on pearl harbor unleashed a cascade of racist assumptions about japanese immigrants and japanese americans in the united states that culminated in the relocation and internment of  people of japanese ancestry   percent of whom had been born in the united states
__label__1 executive order   signed by roosevelt on february     gave the army power to remove people from  military areas  to prevent sabotage or espionage

__label__0 the plan was to develop different strategies  tactics  and even military capabilities to respond more appropriately to small or medium  sized insurgencies  and political or diplomatic crises
__label__0 organized in   sds held its first meeting at the university of michigan  ann arbor
__label__0 its philosophy was expressed in its manifesto  the port huron statement  written by tom hayden and adopted in   affirming the group s dedication to fighting economic inequality and discrimination
__label__1 it called for greater participation in the democratic process by ordinary people  advocated civil disobedience  and rejected the anti  communist position held by most other groups committed to social reform in the united states
__label__0 this act provided increased federal funding to both elementary and secondary schools  allocating more than   billion for the purchase of books and library materials  and the creation of educational programs for disadvantaged children
__label__1 the higher education act  signed into law the same year  provided scholarships and low  interest loans for the poor  increased federal funding for colleges and universities  and created a corps of teachers to serve schools in impoverished areas
__label__0 within the chorus of voices calling for integration and legal equality were many that more stridently demanded empowerment and thus supported black power
__label__0 black power meant a variety of things
__label__0 well before the end of the war  congress had passed one of the most significant and far  reaching pieces of legislation to ease veterans  transition into civilian life  the servicemen s readjustment act  also known as the gi bill   link
__label__1 every honorably discharged veteran who had seen active duty  but not necessarily combat  was eligible to receive a year s worth of unemployment compensation
__label__0 as a result of these conditions  communism was making significant inroads in both italy and france
__label__0 these concerns led truman  along with secretary of state george c marshall  to propose to congress the european recovery program  popularly known as the marshall plan
__label__0 between its implantation in april  and its termination in   this program gave   billion in economic aid to european nations
__label__0 one of the first developers to take advantage of this method was william levitt  who purchased farmland in nassau county  long island  in  and built thousands of prefabricated houses
__label__0 the new community was named levittown
__label__1 in the late s  some white country musicians began to experiment with the rhythms of the blues  a decades  old musical genre of rural southern blacks
__label__0 this experimentation led to the creation of a new musical form known as rockabilly  and by the s  rockabilly had developed into rock and roll
__label__1 rock and roll music celebrated themes such as young love and freedom from the oppression of middle  class society
__label__1 in the late s and early s  many young people came to embrace a new wave of cultural dissent
__label__0 the counterculture offered an alternative to the bland homogeneity of american middle  class life  patriarchal family structures  self  discipline  unquestioning patriotism  and the acquisition of property
__label__0 in fact  there were many alternative cultures
__label__0 although goldwater lost the  election  his vigorous rejection of new deal state and social legislation  along with his support of states  rights  proved popular in the deep south  which had resisted federal efforts at racial integration
__label__0 taking a lesson from goldwater s experience  nixon also employed a southern strategy in
__label__0 denouncing segregation and the denial of the vote to african americans  he nevertheless maintained that southern states be allowed to pursue racial equality at their own pace and criticized forced integration
__label__0 continuing his strategy of pitting one communist nation against another  in may   nixon made another newsworthy trip  traveling to moscow to meet with the soviet leader leonid brezhnev
__label__1 the two discussed a policy of dtente  a relaxation of tensions between their nations  and signed the strategic arms limitation treaty  salt   which limited each side to deploying only two antiballistic missile systems
__label__0 it also limited the number of nuclear missiles maintained by each country
__label__0 but nixon s victory was short  lived  however  for it was soon discovered that he and members of his administration had routinely engaged in unethical and illegal behavior during his first term
__label__1 following the publication of the pentagon papers  for instance  the  plumbers   a group of men used by the white house to spy on the president s opponents and stop leaks to the press  broke into the office of daniel ellsberg s psychiatrist to steal ellsberg s file and learn information that might damage his reputation

__label__0 the goal of the pmrc was to limit the ability of children to listen to music with sexual or violent content
__label__0 in addition to reviving the economy and reducing the size of the federal government  ronald reagan also wished to restore american stature in the world
__label__0 he entered the white house a  cold warrior  and referred to the soviet union in a  speech as an  evil empire
__label__1 dedicated to upholding even authoritarian governments in foreign countries to keep them safe from soviet influence  he was also desperate to put to rest vietnam syndrome  the reluctance to use military force in foreign countries for fear of embarrassing defeat  which had influenced us foreign policy since the mid s
__label__0 wary of not having sufficient domestic support for combat  bush first deployed troops to the area to build up forces in the region and defend saudi arabia via operation desert shield   link
__label__1 on january   bush succeeded in getting resolutions from congress authorizing the use of military force against iraq  and the us then orchestrated an effective air campaign  followed by operation desert storm  a one  hundred  hour land war involving over  us troops and another  from twenty  seven other countries  which expelled iraqi forces from kuwait by the end of february
__label__0 with  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes  he became the first democrat to win reelection to the presidency since franklin roosevelt
__label__0 clinton s victory was partly due to a significant gender gap between the parties  with women tending to favor democratic candidates
__label__0 in   clinton won  percent of women s votes compared to bush s  percent  and in   he received  percent of women s votes while dole won  percent
__label__0 three days later  congress issued a joint resolution authorizing the president to use all means necessary against the individuals  organizations  or nations involved in the attacks
__label__0 on september   in an address to a joint session of congress  bush declared war on terrorism  blamed al  qaeda leader osama bin laden for the attacks  and demanded that the radical islamic fundamentalists who ruled afghanistan  the taliban  turn bin laden over or face attack by the united states
__label__1 this speech encapsulated what became known as the bush doctrine  the belief that the united states has the right to protect itself from terrorist acts by engaging in pre  emptive wars or ousting hostile governments in favor of friendly  preferably democratic  regimes
__label__0 the more militant side won  and the argument for war was gradually laid out for the american people
__label__1 the immediate impetus to the invasion  it argued  was the fear that hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction  wmds   nuclear  chemical  or biological weapons capable of wreaking great havoc
__label__0 hussein had in fact used wmds against iranian forces during his war with iran in the s  and against the kurds in northern iraq in   a time when the united states actively supported the iraqi dictator
__label__0 the second proposed solution was to give students the opportunity to attend schools with better performance records
__label__1 some of these might be charter schools  institutions funded by local tax monies in much the same way as public schools  but able to accept private donations and exempt from some of the rules public schools must follow
__label__0 during the administration of george h w bush  the development of charter schools had gathered momentum  and the american federation of teachers welcomed them as places to employ innovative teaching methods or offer specialized instruction in particular subjects
__label__0 once they had purchased the loans  larger investment banks bundled them into huge packages known as collateralized debt obligations  cdos  and sold them to investors around the world
__label__1 even though cdos consisted of subprime mortgages  credit card debt  and other risky investments  credit ratings agencies had a financial incentive to rate them as very safe
__label__0 in the s  the idea of legal  same  sex marriage seemed particularly unlikely  neither of the two main political parties expressed support for it
__label__0 things began to change  however  following vermont s decision to allow same  sex couples to form state  recognized civil unions in which they could enjoy all the legal rights and privileges of marriage
__label__0 although it was the intention of the state to create a type of legal relationship equivalent to marriage  it did not use the word  marriage  to describe it
__label__0 discontent over the affordable care act helped the republicans capture the majority in the house of representatives in the  midterm elections
__label__1 soil particles between  and  mm are called silt  and even smaller particles  less than  mm in diameter  are called clay
__label__1 some soils have no dominant particle size and contain a mixture of sand  silt  and humus  these soils are called loams
__label__1 the organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material
__label__1 mineral soils form directly from the weathering of bedrock  the solid rock that lies beneath the soil  and therefore  they have a similar composition to the original rock
__label__1 mineral soils form directly from the weathering of bedrock  the solid rock that lies beneath the soil  and therefore  they have a similar composition to the original rock
__label__1 the soil profile has four distinct layers    o horizon    a horizon    b horizon  or subsoil  and   c horizon  or soil base   link
__label__1 the o horizon has freshly decomposing organic matter  humus  at its surface  with decomposed vegetation at its base
__label__1 the o horizon has freshly decomposing organic matter  humus  at its surface  with decomposed vegetation at its base
__label__0 humus enriches the soil with nutrients and enhances soil moisture retention
__label__0 a parasitic plant depends on its host for survival
__label__0 some parasitic plants have no leaves
__label__1 an epiphyte is a plant that grows on other plants  but is not dependent upon the other plant for nutrition   link
__label__1 epiphytes have two types of roots  clinging aerial roots  which absorb nutrients from humus that accumulates in the crevices of trees  and aerial roots  which absorb moisture from the atmosphere
__label__0 the haploid gametophyte produces the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures
__label__0 fusion of the male and females gametes forms the diploid zygote  which develops into the sporophyte
__label__0 after reaching maturity  the diploid sporophyte produces spores by meiosis  which in turn divide by mitosis to produce the haploid gametophyte
__label__0 the androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia
__label__1 the innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium  or the female reproductive component  s
__label__1 the carpel is the individual unit of the gynoecium and has a stigma  style  and ovary
__label__0 female gametophyte  the embryo sac
__label__0 while the details may vary between species  the overall development of the female gametophyte has two distinct phases
__label__1 first  in the process of megasporogenesis  a single cell in the diploid megasporangium  an area of tissue in the ovules  undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores  only one of which survives
__label__1 during the second phase  megagametogenesis  the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight  nucleate  seven  cell female gametophyte  also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac
__label__1 during the second phase  megagametogenesis  the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight  nucleate  seven  cell female gametophyte  also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac
__label__0 this central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm
__label__0 three nuclei position themselves on the end of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the antipodal cells  which later degenerate
__label__0 the nucleus closest to the micropyle becomes the female gamete  or egg cell  and the two adjacent nuclei develop into synergid cells   link
__label__0 male gametophytea male cone has a central axis on which bracts  a type of modified leaf  are attached
__label__1 the bracts are known as microsporophylls   link   and are the sites where microspores will develop
__label__0 the microspores develop inside the microsporangium
__label__0 pollination takes two forms  self  pollination and cross  pollination
__label__1 self  pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower  or another flower on the same plant
__label__1 cross  pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species
__label__0 the pollen tube is guided by the chemicals secreted by the synergids present in the embryo sac  and it enters the ovule sac through the micropyle
__label__1 of the two sperm cells  one sperm fertilizes the egg cell  forming a diploid zygote  the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei  forming a triploid cell that develops into the endosperm
__label__0 together  these two fertilization events in angiosperms are known as double fertilization   link
__label__0 the terminal cell also divides  giving rise to a globular  shaped proembryo   link  a
__label__1 in dicots  eudicots   the developing embryo has a heart shape  due to the presence of the two rudimentary cotyledons   link  b
__label__1 in non  endospermic dicots  such as capsella bursa  the endosperm develops initially  but is then digested  and the food reserves are moved into the two cotyledons
__label__0 the two cotyledons in the dicot seed also have vascular connections to the embryo
__label__0 in endospermic dicots  the food reserves are stored in the endosperm
__label__0 during germination  the two cotyledons therefore act as absorptive organs to take up the enzymatically released food reserves  much like in monocots  monocots  by definition  also have endospermic seeds
__label__1 the embryonic axis consists of three parts  the plumule  the radicle  and the hypocotyl
__label__1 the portion of the embryo between the cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl  hypocotyl means  below the cotyledons
__label__1 the embryonic axis terminates in a radicle  the embryonic root   which is the region from which the root will develop
__label__1 the part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the epicotyl
__label__1 the plumule is composed of the epicotyl  young leaves  and the shoot apical meristem  upon germination in dicot seeds  the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards
__label__0 this shape is called the plumule hook  and it persists as long as germination proceeds in the dark
__label__1 many mature seeds enter a period of inactivity  or extremely low metabolic activity  a process known as dormancy  which may last for months  years or even centuries
__label__0 dormancy helps keep seeds viable during unfavorable conditions
__label__0 fruits may be classified as simple  aggregate  multiple  or accessory  depending on their origin   link
__label__1 if the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary  it is known as a simple fruit  as seen in nuts and beans
__label__1 an aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel  but all are in the same flower  the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit  as seen in the raspberry
__label__0 an example is the pineapple  where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit
__label__1 accessory fruits  sometimes called false fruits  are not derived from the ovary  but from another part of the flower  such as the receptacle  strawberry  or the hypanthium  apples and pears
__label__1 either the ovule or part of the ovary  which is diploid in nature  gives rise to a new seed
__label__0 this method of reproduction is known as apomixis
__label__1 plants such as coleus and money plant are propagated through stem cuttings  where a portion of the stem containing nodes and internodes is placed in moist soil and allowed to root
__label__0 in some species  stems can start producing a root even when placed only in water
__label__1 in another classification based on flowering frequency  monocarpic plants flower only once in their lifetime  examples include bamboo and yucca
__label__0 during the vegetative period of their life cycle  which may be as long as  years in some bamboo species   these plants may reproduce asexually and accumulate a great deal of food material that will be required during their once  in  a  lifetime flowering and setting of seed after fertilization
__label__0 they are asymmetrical  radial  or bilateral in form as illustrated in  link
__label__1 asymmetrical animals are animals with no pattern or symmetry  an example of an asymmetrical animal is a sponge
__label__1 radial symmetry  as illustrated in  link   describes when an animal has an up  and  down orientation  any plane cut along its longitudinal axis through the organism produces equal halves  but not a definite right or left side
__label__0 no energy system is one hundred percent efficient  and an animal s metabolism produces waste energy in the form of heat
__label__1 if an animal can conserve that heat and maintain a relatively constant body temperature  it is classified as a warm  blooded animal and called an endotherm
__label__0 the insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur  fat  or feathers
__label__0 animals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor
__label__1 torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions
__label__0 torpor can be used by animals for long periods  such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months  in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature
__label__0 a standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes
__label__1 a sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions
__label__1 a midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle  making two equal right and left halves
__label__1 a frontal plane  also called a coronal plane  separates the front from the back
__label__1 a transverse plane  or  horizontal plane  divides the animal into upper and lower portions
__label__1 this is sometimes called a cross section  and  if the transverse cut is at an angle  it is called an oblique plane
__label__1 epithelial tissuesepithelial tissues cover the outside of organs and structures in the body and line the lumens of organs in a single layer or multiple layers of cells
__label__0 the types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and the number of layers of cells
__label__1 cuboidal epithelial cells  shown in  link   are cube  shaped with a single  central nucleus
__label__0 they are most commonly found in a single layer representing a simple epithelia in glandular tissues throughout the body where they prepare and secrete glandular material
__label__1 transitional or uroepithelial cells appear only in the urinary system  primarily in the bladder and ureter
__label__0 these cells are arranged in a stratified layer  but they have the capability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in a relaxed  empty bladder  as illustrated in  link
__label__1 loose connective tissue  also called areolar connective tissue  has a sampling of all of the components of a connective tissue
__label__0 as illustrated in  link   loose connective tissue has some fibroblasts  macrophages are present as well
__label__1 cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers
__label__1 the cells  called chondrocytes  make the matrix and fibers of the tissue
__label__1 chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae
__label__1 a blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within the haversian canal  with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae
__label__1 the wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi  they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells
__label__1 spongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength
__label__1 the goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a point or value called a set point
__label__0 while there are normal fluctuations from the set point  the body s systems will usually attempt to go back to this point
__label__0 medication can lower blood pressure and lower the set point in the system to a more healthy level
__label__0 this is called a process of alteration of the set point in a feedback loop
__label__1 herbivores are animals whose primary food source is plant  based
__label__0 examples of herbivores  as shown in  link  include vertebrates like deer  koalas  and some bird species  as well as invertebrates such as crickets and caterpillars
__label__0 because most birds fly  their metabolic rates are high in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low
__label__1 the stomach of birds has two chambers  the proventriculus  where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach  and the gizzard  where the food is stored  soaked  and mechanically ground
__label__0 the undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes regurgitated
__label__1 saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose
__label__1 another enzyme called lipase is produced by the cells in the tongue
__label__0 lipases are a class of enzymes that can break down triglycerides
__label__0 the chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed
__label__1 the smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo a series of wave like movements called peristalsis that push the food toward the stomach  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 the peristalsis wave is unidirectional  it moves food from the mouth to the stomach  and reverse movement is not possible
__label__0 protein digestion is mediated by an enzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber
__label__1 pepsin is secreted by the chief cells in the stomach in an inactive form called pepsinogen
__label__0 pepsin breaks peptide bonds and cleaves proteins into smaller polypeptides  it also helps activate more pepsinogen  starting a positive feedback mechanism that generates more pepsin
__label__1 the small intestine is the organ where the digestion of protein  fats  and carbohydrates is completed
__label__1 the small intestine is a long tube  like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger  like projections called the villi
__label__0 the small intestine is a long tube  like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger  like projections called the villi
__label__1 the apical surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli
__label__1 the rectum is the terminal end of the large intestine  as shown in  link
__label__0 the primary role of the rectum is to store the feces until defecation
__label__0 the pancreas is another important gland that secretes digestive juices
__label__1 the chyme produced from the stomach is highly acidic in nature  the pancreatic juices contain high levels of bicarbonate  an alkali that neutralizes the acidic chyme
__label__0 the omega alpha  linolenic acid and the omega linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane phospholipids
__label__1 vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities for many enzymes to function and  for this reason  are considered to be co  enzymes
__label__0 absence or low levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on health  as outlined in  link  and  link
__label__1 digestion and absorptiondigestion is the mechanical and chemical break down of food into small organic fragments
__label__0 it is important to break down macromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive epithelium
__label__1 further breakdown of peptides to single amino acids is aided by enzymes called peptidases  those that break down peptides
__label__0 specifically  carboxypeptidase  dipeptidase  and aminopeptidase play important roles in reducing the peptides to free amino acids
__label__0 the amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestines
__label__1 the gastric phase begins once the food arrives in the stomach
__label__0 it builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic phase
__label__0 one of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment
__label__0 during the gastric phase  the hormone gastrin is secreted by g cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins
__label__0 gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid  or hydrochloric acid  hcl  which aids in the digestion of the proteins
__label__1 gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid  or hydrochloric acid  hcl  which aids in the digestion of the proteins
__label__1 in order to neutralize the acidic chyme  a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum
__label__0 secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called cholecystokinin  cck
__label__1 not only does cck stimulate the pancreas to produce the requisite pancreatic juices  it also stimulates the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum
__label__0 neurons also contain unique structures  illustrated in  link  for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible
__label__1 dendrites are tree  like structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called synapses
__label__0 although some neurons do not have any dendrites  some types of neurons have multiple dendrites
__label__0 neurons usually have one or two axons  but some neurons  like amacrine cells in the retina  do not contain any axons
__label__1 some axons are covered with myelin  which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon  greatly increasing the speed on conduction
__label__0 this insulation is important as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter  from the base of the spine to the toes
__label__0 astrocytes  in particular  have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity  transmit calcium waves between astrocytes  and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses
__label__1 satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the pns
__label__1 microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms
__label__0 one axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes  and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons
__label__0 this is distinctive from the pns where a single schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire schwann cell surrounds the axon
__label__1 radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations
__label__0 voltage  gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell
__label__1 the difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential
__label__0 to accomplish this  the na channels close and can not be opened
__label__0 this begins the neuron s refractory period  in which it can not produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open
__label__0 at the same time  voltage  gated k channels open  allowing k to leave the cell
__label__0 this depolarization causes voltage  gated ca  channels to open
__label__0 calcium ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes small membrane  bound vesicles  called synaptic vesicles  containing neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the presynaptic membrane
__label__0 synaptic vesicles are shown in  link   which is an image from a scanning electron microscope
__label__0 this depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential  epsp  and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential
__label__1 release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials  ipsps   a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane
__label__0 for example  when the neurotransmitter gaba  gamma  aminobutyric acid  is released from a presynaptic neuron  it binds to and opens cl channels
__label__1 long  term depression  ltd  is essentially the reverse of ltp  it is a long  term weakening of a synaptic connection
__label__0 one mechanism known to cause ltd also involves ampa receptors
__label__0 the dura mater also contains vein  like structures that carry blood from the brain back to the heart
__label__0 the middle layer is the web  like arachnoid mater
__label__1 the last layer is the pia mater  latin for  soft mother    which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap
__label__0 the space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid  csf
__label__1 csf is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in fluid  filled compartments in the cns called ventricles
__label__0 the brain floats in csf  which acts as a cushion and shock absorber and makes the brain neutrally buoyant
__label__1 the frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain  over the eyes
__label__0 this lobe contains the olfactory bulb  which processes smells
__label__1 the occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain
__label__0 it is primarily involved in vision  seeing  recognizing  and identifying the visual world
__label__0 it is primarily involved in vision  seeing  recognizing  and identifying the visual world
__label__1 interconnected brain areas called the basal ganglia  or basal nuclei   shown in  link  b  play important roles in movement control and posture
__label__0 damage to the basal ganglia  as in parkinson s disease  leads to motor impairments like a shuffling gait when walking
__label__1 the limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion  as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation
__label__0 it plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus
__label__0 it plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus
__label__1 the cerebellum  latin for  little brain    shown in  link   sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem
__label__0 the cerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks
__label__1 the pns can be broken down into the autonomic nervous system  which controls bodily functions without conscious control  and the sensory  somatic nervous system  which transmits sensory information from the skin  muscles  and sensory organs to the cns and sends motor commands from the cns to the muscles
__label__1 the acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons
__label__1 postganglionic neurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs
__label__0 as anyone who has ever felt a rush before a big test  speech  or athletic event can attest  the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive
__label__1 spinal nerves transmit sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and the rest of the body
__label__0 each of the  spinal nerves  in humans  contains both sensory and motor axons
__label__1 like alzheimer s disease  parkinson s disease is a neurodegenerative disease
__label__0 it was first characterized by james parkinson in
__label__0 schizophrenia is a serious and often debilitating mental illness affecting one percent of people in the united states
__label__0 symptoms of the disease include the inability to differentiate between reality and imagination  inappropriate and unregulated emotional responses  difficulty thinking  and problems with social situations
__label__1 symptoms of the disease include the inability to differentiate between reality and imagination  inappropriate and unregulated emotional responses  difficulty thinking  and problems with social situations
__label__1 additionally  we possess general senses  also called somatosensation  which respond to stimuli like temperature  pain  pressure  and vibration
__label__1 vestibular sensation  which is an organism s sense of spatial orientation and balance  proprioception  position of bones  joints  and muscles   and the sense of limb position that is used to track kinesthesia  limb movement  are part of somatosensation
__label__1 vestibular sensation  which is an organism s sense of spatial orientation and balance  proprioception  position of bones  joints  and muscles   and the sense of limb position that is used to track kinesthesia  limb movement  are part of somatosensation
__label__0 although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different  all share a common function  to convert a stimulus  such as light  or sound  or the position of the body  into an electrical signal in the nervous system
__label__1 the first step in sensation is reception  which is the activation of sensory receptors by stimuli such as mechanical stimuli  being bent or squished  for example   chemicals  or temperature
__label__0 the receptor can then respond to the stimuli
__label__0 how is sensory input  such as pressure on the skin  changed to a receptor potential
__label__1 in this example  a type of receptor called a mechanoreceptor  as shown in  link   possesses specialized membranes that respond to pressure
__label__0 disturbance of these dendrites by compressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron  changing its electrical potential
__label__0 a fifth type of mechanoreceptor  krause end bulbs  are found only in specialized regions
__label__1 merkel s disks  shown in  link   are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis  both in skin that has hair and on glabrous skin  that is  the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers  the soles of the feet  and the lips of humans and other primates
__label__1 merkel s disks  shown in  link   are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis  both in skin that has hair and on glabrous skin  that is  the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers  the soles of the feet  and the lips of humans and other primates
__label__0 merkel s disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips
__label__0 note that these warmth detectors are situated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors
__label__1 it is not surprising  then  that humans detect cold stimuli before they detect warm stimuli  pacinian corpuscles  seen in  link   are located deep in the dermis of both glabrous and hairy skin and are structurally similar to meissner s corpuscles  they are found in the bone periosteum  joint capsules  pancreas and other viscera  breast  and genitals
__label__0 they are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that sense deep transient  but not prolonged  pressure and high  frequency vibration
__label__1 pain is the name given to nociception  which is the neural processing of injurious stimuli in response to tissue damage
__label__0 pain is caused by true sources of injury  such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal burn or contact with a corrosive chemical
__label__1 in mammals  sound waves are collected by the external  cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna  then travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum  the innermost part of the outer ear  illustrated in  link
__label__1 interior to the tympanum is the middle ear
__label__1 the middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles  which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear
__label__0 the three ossicles are the malleus  also known as the hammer   the incus  the anvil   and stapes  the stirrup
__label__0 the aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup
__label__0 the vibrations of the oval window create pressure waves in the fluid  perilymph  inside the cochlea
__label__1 the cochlea is a whorled structure  like the shell of a snail  and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal  as illustrated in  link
__label__1 inside the cochlea  the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea  curling toward the cochlea s center
__label__0 the site of transduction is in the organ of corti  spiral organ
__label__1 it is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil  with their exposed short  hair  like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them
__label__1 vision is the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and interpret them into images
__label__0 animals are bombarded with sensory information  and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic
__label__0 it passes through other layers that process it so that it can be interpreted by the retina   link  b
__label__1 the cornea  the front transparent layer of the eye  and the crystalline lens  a transparent convex structure behind the cornea  both refract  bend  light to focus the image on the retina
__label__1 the iris  which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye  is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye
__label__0 presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina
__label__1 presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short
__label__1 presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short
__label__0 for both defects  images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry
__label__1 the fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision
__label__0 the fovea has a high density of cones
__label__1 another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain  where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information
__label__0 finally  there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus  scn  of the hypothalamus
__label__1 taste  also called gustation  and smell  also called olfaction  are the most interconnected senses in that both involve molecules of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors
__label__1 taste  also called gustation  and smell  also called olfaction  are the most interconnected senses in that both involve molecules of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors
__label__0 smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or other animals  whether potential mates  predators  or prey  or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival
__label__1 odorants  odor molecules  enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium  the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity  as illustrated in  link
__label__1 the olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about  cm in humans
__label__0 recall that sensory cells are neurons
__label__1 pheromonesa pheromone is a chemical released by an animal that affects the behavior or physiology of animals of the same species
__label__0 pheromonal signals can have profound effects on animals that inhale them  but pheromones apparently are not consciously perceived in the same way as other odors
__label__1 olfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin  unmyelinated axons
__label__1 the olfactory bulb is composed of neural clusters called glomeruli  and each glomerulus receives signals from one type of olfactory receptor  so each glomerulus is specific to one odorant
__label__0 from glomeruli  olfactory signals travel directly to the olfactory cortex and then to the frontal cortex and the thalamus
__label__1 the amino acid  derived hormones are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan  shown in  link
__label__0 if a hormone is amino acid  derived  its chemical name will end in  ine
__label__0 additionally  the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time  resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity
__label__1 in up  regulation  the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels  making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity
__label__1 when the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels  called down  regulation  cellular activity is reduced
__label__0 amino acid derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipid  derived  lipid  soluble  and therefore can not diffuse through the plasma membrane of cells
__label__1 lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer surface of the plasma membrane  via plasma membrane hormone receptors
__label__0 unlike steroid hormones  lipid insoluble hormones do not directly affect the target cell because they can not enter the cell and act directly on dna
__label__0 when a hormone binds to the receptor  the g  protein is activated by binding guanosine triphosphate  or gtp  in place of gdp
__label__0 after binding  gtp is hydrolysed by the g  protein into gdp and becomes inactive  the activated g  protein in turn activates a membrane  bound enzyme called adenylyl cyclase
__label__1 adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of atp to camp
__label__1 hormonal stimuli refers to the release of a hormone in response to another hormone
__label__0 a number of endocrine glands release hormones when stimulated by hormones released by other endocrine glands
__label__0 it synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland
__label__1 the hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control  the pituitary gland  sometimes called the hypophysis or  master gland  is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica  a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull  illustrated in  link
__label__1 the hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control  the pituitary gland  sometimes called the hypophysis or  master gland  is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica  a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull  illustrated in  link
__label__0 it is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk  or infundibulum
__label__1 the anterior pituitary gland  or adenohypophysis  is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus  down along the infundibulum  and to the anterior pituitary
__label__1 this capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system
__label__1 a portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another  therefore  the hypophyseal portal system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the circulatory system  the anterior pituitary produces seven hormones  growth hormone  gh   prolactin  prl   thyroid  stimulating hormone  tsh   melanin  stimulating hormone  msh   adrenocorticotropic hormone  acth   follicle  stimulating hormone  fsh   and luteinizing hormone  lh
__label__1 the thyroid gland is located in the neck  just below the larynx and in front of the trachea  as shown in  link
__label__0 it is a butterfly  shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus
__label__0 it has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular system
__label__0 most people have four parathyroid glands  however  the number can vary from two to six
__label__1 this must be contrasted with the absolute poverty that is frequently found in underdeveloped countries and defined as the inability  or near  inability  to afford basic necessities such as food  byrns
__label__0 we can not even rely on unemployment statistics to provide a clear picture of total unemployment in the united states
__label__1 first  unemployment statistics do not take into account underemployment  a state in which a person accepts a lower paying  lower status job than their education and experience qualifies them to perform
__label__0 second  unemployment statistics only count those
__label__1 we see the emergence of global assembly lines  where products are assembled over the course of several international transactions
__label__1 for instance  apple designs its next  generation mac prototype in the united states  components are made in various peripheral nations  they are then shipped to another peripheral nation such as malaysia for assembly  and tech support is outsourced to india  globalization has also led to the development of global commodity chains  where internationally integrated economic links connect workers and corporations for the purpose of manufacture and marketing  plahe
__label__0 what if the us economy thrived solely on basic bartering instead of its bustling agricultural and technological goods
__label__0 would you still see a busy building like the one shown in  link
__label__1 in sociology  economy refers to the social institution through which a society s resources are exchanged and managed
__label__1 the earliest economies were based on trade  which is often a simple exchange in which people traded one item for another
__label__0 at first  most goods and services were traded as gifts or through bartering between small social groups  mauss
__label__1 exchanging one form of goods or services for another was known as bartering
__label__0 this system only works when one person happens to have something the other person needs at the same time
__label__0 the industrial revolution also changed agricultural practices
__label__1 until that time  many people practiced subsistence farming in which they produced only enough to feed themselves and pay their taxes
__label__0 new technology introduced gasoline  powered farm tools such as tractors  seed drills  threshers  and combine harvesters
__label__0 because of challenges in their economies  several of these communist countries have moved from central planning to letting market forces help determine many production and pricing decisions
__label__1 market socialism describes a subtype of socialism that adopts certain traits of capitalism  like allowing limited private ownership or consulting market demands
__label__0 this could involve situations like profits generated by a company going directly to the employees of the company or being used as public funds  gregory and stuart
__label__0 markets produce goods as they are supposed to  but eventually the market is saturated and the supply of goods exceeds the demands
__label__1 typically the market goes through phases of surplus  or excess  inflation  where the money in your pocket today buys less than it did yesterday  and recession  which occurs when there are two or more consecutive quarters of economic decline
__label__0 the functionalist would say to let market forces fluctuate in a cycle through these stages
__label__0 sociologists use the term social stratification to describe the system of social standing
__label__1 social stratification refers to a society s categorization of its people into rankings of socioeconomic tiers based on factors like wealth  income  race  education  and power
__label__0 this was generally a closed system  with people born into positions of nobility
__label__1 wealth was passed from generation to generation through primogeniture  a law stating that all property would be inherited by the firstborn son
__label__0 if the family had no son  the land went to the next closest male relation
__label__0 individuals can experience upward or downward social mobility for a variety of reasons
__label__1 upward mobility refers to an increase  or upward shift  in social class
__label__0 in the united states  people applaud the rags  to  riches achievements of celebrities like jennifer lopez or michael jordan
__label__1 global stratification compares the wealth  economic stability  status  and power of countries across the world
__label__0 global stratification highlights worldwide patterns of social inequality
__label__0 in the early years of civilization  hunter  gatherer and agrarian societies lived off the earth and rarely interacted with other societies
__label__1 just as the united states  wealth is increasingly concentrated among its richest citizens while the middle class slowly disappears  global inequality is concentrating resources in certain nations and is significantly affecting the opportunities of individuals in poorer and less powerful countries
__label__0 in fact  a recent oxfam    report that suggested the richest eighty  five people in the world are worth more than the poorest  billion combined
__label__0 familiar and still used by many  it classifies countries into first world  second world  and third world nations based on their respective economic development and standards of living
__label__1 when this nomenclature was developed  capitalistic democracies such as the united states and japan were considered part of the first world
__label__1 the poorest  most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of sub  saharan africa  latin america  and asia
__label__1 the second world was the in  between category  nations not as limited in development as the third world  but not as well off as the first world  having moderate economies and standard of living  such as china or cuba
__label__1 later  sociologist manual castells    added the term fourth world to refer to stigmatized minority groups that were denied a political voice all over the globe  indigenous minority populations  prisoners  and the homeless  for example
__label__0 also during the cold war  global inequality was described in terms of economic development
__label__0 we can be sure the workers in a cuban cigar factory  for example  which are owned or leased by global core nation companies  are not enjoying the same privileges and rights as us workers
__label__1 semi  peripheral nations are in  between nations  not powerful enough to dictate policy but nevertheless acting as a major source for raw material and an expanding middle  class marketplace for core nations  while also exploiting peripheral nations
__label__0 mexico is an example  providing abundant cheap agricultural labor to the us  and supplying goods to the united states market at a rate dictated by the us without the constitutional protections offered to united states workers
__label__1 capital flight refers to the movement  flight  of capital from one nation to another  as when general motors automotive company closed us factories in michigan and opened factories in mexico
__label__1 deindustrialization  a related issue  occurs as a consequence of capital flight  as no new companies open to replace jobs lost to foreign nations
__label__0 as expected  global companies move their industrial processes to the places where they can get the most production with the least cost  including the building of infrastructure  training of workers  shipping of goods  and  of course  paying employee wages
__label__0 people often disparage  keeping up with the joneses   the idea that you must keep up with the neighbors  standard of living to not feel deprived
__label__0 but it is true that you might feel  poor  if you are living without a car to drive to and from work  without any money for a safety net should a family member fall ill  and without any  extras  beyond just making ends meet
__label__1 contrary to relative poverty  people who live in absolute poverty lack even the basic necessities  which typically include adequate food  clean water  safe housing  and access to healthcare
__label__1 absolute poverty is defined by the world bank  a  as when someone lives on less than   a day
__label__0 dependency theory
__label__0 dependency theory was created in part as a response to the western  centric mindset of modernization theory
__label__1 it states that global inequality is primarily caused by core nations  or high  income nations  exploiting semi  peripheral and peripheral nations  or middle  income and low  income nations   which creates a cycle of dependence  hendricks
__label__1 ethnicity is a term that describes shared culture  the practices  values  and beliefs of a group
__label__1 ethnicity is a term that describes shared culture  the practices  values  and beliefs of a group
__label__0 this culture might include shared language  religion  and traditions  among other commonalities
__label__0 let us explore the differences between these concepts
__label__1 stereotypes are oversimplified generalizations about groups of people
__label__0 stereotypes can be based on race  ethnicity  age  gender  sexual orientation  almost any characteristic
__label__1 the ku klux klan is an example of a racist organization  its members  belief in white supremacy has encouraged over a century of hate crime and hate speech
__label__1 institutional racism refers to the way in which racism is embedded in the fabric of society
__label__0 for example  the disproportionate number of black men arrested  charged  and convicted of crimes may reflect racial profiling  a form of institutional racism
__label__0 for example  when a newspaper identifies by race individuals accused of a crime  it may enhance stereotypes of a certain minority
__label__1 another example of racist practices is racial steering  in which real estate agents direct prospective homeowners toward or away from certain neighborhoods based on their race
__label__0 racist attitudes and beliefs are often more insidious and harder to pin down than specific racist practices
__label__0 ferguson s racial imbalance may explain in part why  even though in  only about  percent of its population was black  in  blacks were detained in  percent of stops   percent of searches  and  percent of arrests  missouri attorney general s office
__label__0 in addition  de facto segregation in ferguson s schools  a race  based wealth gap  urban sprawl  and a black unemployment rate three times that of the white unemployment rate worsened existing racial tensions in ferguson while also reflecting nationwide racial inequalities  bouie
__label__0 multiple identities
__label__0 golfer tiger woods has chinese  thai  african american  native american  and dutch heritage
__label__0 individuals with multiple ethnic backgrounds are becoming more common
__label__1 genocide  the deliberate annihilation of a targeted  usually subordinate  group  is the most toxic intergroup relationship
__label__0 historically  we can see that genocide has included both the intent to exterminate a group and the function of exterminating of a group  intentional or not
__label__0 pluralism is represented by the ideal of the united states as a  salad bowl   a great mixture of different cultures where each culture retains its own identity and yet adds to the flavor of the whole
__label__1 true pluralism is characterized by mutual respect on the part of all cultures  both dominant and subordinate  creating a multicultural environment of acceptance
__label__0 asian americans certainly have been subject to their share of racial prejudice  despite the seemingly positive stereotype as the model minority
__label__1 the model minority stereotype is applied to a minority group that is seen as reaching significant educational  professional  and socioeconomic levels without challenging the existing establishment
__label__1 other advocacy agencies frequently use the acronyms lbgt and lbgtq  which stands for  lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender   and  queer  or  questioning  when the q is added
__label__0 sociologically  it is clear that gay and lesbian couples are negatively affected in states where they are denied the legal right to marriage
__label__1 in   the defense of marriage act  doma  was passed  explicitly limiting the definition of  marriage  to a union between one man and one woman
__label__0 it also allowed individual states to choose whether or not they recognized same  sex marriages performed in other states
__label__1 gender identity is a person s deeply held internal perception of his or her gender
__label__1 individuals who identify with the role that is the different from their biological sex are called transgender
__label__0 transgender is not the same as homosexual  and many homosexual males view both their sex and gender as male
__label__0 gender stereotypes form the basis of sexism
__label__1 sexism refers to prejudiced beliefs that value one sex over another
__label__0 it varies in its level of severity
__label__1 the social construction of sexuality refers to the way in which socially created definitions about the cultural appropriateness of sex  linked behavior shape the way people see and experience sexuality
__label__0 this is in marked contrast to theories of sex  gender  and sexuality that link male and female behavior to biological determinism  or the belief that men and women behave differently due to differences in their biology
__label__0 madame jeanne calment of france was the world s oldest living person until she died at  years old  there are currently six women in the world whose ages are well documented as  years or older  diebel
__label__1 supercentenarians are people living to  years or more
__label__0 in august   there were seventy  five verified supercentenarians worldwide  seventy  three women and two men
__label__1 social gerontology refers to a specialized field of gerontology that examines the social  and sociological  aspects of aging
__label__0 researchers focus on developing a broad understanding of the experiences of people at specific ages  such as mental and physical wellbeing  plus age  specific concerns such as the process of dying
__label__0 baby boomers
__label__1 of particular interest to gerontologists today is the population of baby boomers  the cohort born between  and  and now reaching their s
__label__0 coming of age in the s and early s  the baby boom generation was the first group of children and teenagers with their own spending power and therefore their own marketing power  macunovich
__label__0 it is helpful to understand aging in the context of these phases
__label__1 a life course is the period from birth to death  including a sequence of predictable life events such as physical maturation
__label__0 each phase comes with different responsibilities and expectations  which of course vary by individual and culture
__label__0 for many teenagers and young adults  losing a grandparent or another older relative can be the first loss of a loved one they experience
__label__1 it may be their first encounter with grief  a psychological  emotional  and social response to the feelings of loss that accompanies death or a similar event
__label__0 the changing concept of hospice is an indicator of our society s changing view of death
__label__1 hospice is a type of healthcare that treats terminally ill people when  cure  oriented treatments  are no longer an option  hospice foundation of america b
__label__0 in early societies  the elderly were respected and revered
__label__1 many preindustrial societies observed gerontocracy  a type of social structure wherein the power is held by a society s oldest members
__label__0 in some countries today  the elderly still have influence and power and their vast knowledge is respected
__label__0 the social withdrawal that cummings and henry recognized     and its notion that elderly people need to find replacement roles for those they ve lost  is addressed anew in activity theory
__label__1 according to this theory  activity levels and social involvement are key to this process  and key to happiness  havinghurst   neugarten   havinghurst  neugarten  and tobin
__label__0 another theory in the conflict perspective is age stratification theory  riley  johnson  and foner
__label__0 though it may seem obvious now  with our awareness of ageism  age stratification theorists were the first to suggest that members of society might be stratified by age  just as they are stratified by race  class  and gender
__label__0 another theory within the symbolic interaction perspective is selective optimization with compensation theory
__label__1 baltes and baltes    based their theory on the idea that successful personal development throughout the life course and subsequent mastery of the challenges associated with everyday life are based on the components of selection  optimization  and compensation
__label__0 sociologists  on the other hand  tend to define family more in terms of the manner in which members relate to one another than on a strict configuration of status roles
__label__1 here  we ll define family as a socially recognized group  usually joined by blood  marriage  cohabitation  or adoption  that forms an emotional connection and serves as an economic unit of society
__label__0 sociologists identify different types of families based on how one enters into them
__label__1 marriage patternswith single parenting and cohabitation  when a couple shares a residence but not a marriage  becoming more acceptable in recent years  people may be less motivated to get married
__label__0 in a recent survey   percent of respondents answered  yes  when asked whether marriage is becoming obsolete  pew research center
__label__0 instances of polygamy are almost exclusively in the form of polygyny
__label__1 polygyny refers to a man being married to more than one woman at the same time
__label__1 the reverse  when a woman is married to more than one man at the same time  is called polyandry
__label__1 both paternal and maternal ancestors are considered part of one s family
__label__0 this pattern of tracing kinship is called bilateral descent
__label__1 note that kinship  or one s traceable ancestry  can be based on blood or marriage or adoption
__label__1 there are three types of unilateral descent  patrilineal  which follows the father s line only  matrilineal  which follows the mother s side only  and ambilineal  which follows either the father s only or the mother s side only  depending on the situation
__label__0 in partrilineal societies  such as those in rural china and india  only males carry on the family surname
__label__0 today  however  these models have been criticized for their linear and conventional assumptions as well as for their failure to capture the diversity of family forms
__label__1 while reviewing some of these once  popular theories  it is important to identify their strengths and weaknesses  the set of predictable steps and patterns families experience over time is referred to as the family life cycle
__label__0 one of the first designs of the family life cycle was developed by paul glick in
__label__0 of these children   percent live with grandparents   percent live with other relatives  and  percent live with nonrelatives
__label__0 this family structure is referred to as the extended family  and may include aunts  uncles  and cousins living in the same home
__label__0 foster parents account for about a quarter of nonrelatives
__label__0 some people associate religion with places of worship  a synagogue or church   others with a practice  confession or meditation   and still others with a concept that guides their daily lives  like dharma or sin
__label__1 all these people can agree that religion is a system of beliefs  values  and practices concerning what a person holds sacred or considers to be spiritually significant
__label__0 does religion bring fear  wonder  relief  explanation of the unknown or control over freedom and choice
__label__0 how do our religious perspectives affect our behavior
__label__0 another illustration of religious beliefs is the creation stories we find in different religions
__label__1 religious rituals are behaviors or practices that are either required or expected of the members of a particular group  such as bar mitzvah or confession of sins  barkan and greenwood
__label__0 the history of religion as a sociological conceptin the wake of nineteenth century european industrialization and secularization  three social theorists attempted to examine the relationship between religion and society  mile durkheim  max weber  and karl marx
__label__0 they are among the founding thinkers of modern sociology
__label__1 some sects do not grow into denominations
__label__0 sociologists call these established sects
__label__0 established sects  such as the amish or jehovah s witnesses fall halfway between sect and denomination on the ecclesia  cult continuum because they have a mixture of sect  like and denomination  like characteristics
__label__0 note that some religions may be practiced  or understood  in various categories
__label__0 for instance  the christian notion of the holy trinity  god  jesus  holy spirit  defies the definition of monotheism  which is a religion based on belief in a single deity  to some scholars
__label__0 similarly  many westerners view the multiple manifestations of hinduism s godhead as polytheistic  which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities   while hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the christian trinity
__label__1 some japanese practice shinto  which follows animism  which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings  like animals  plants  and objects of the natural world  while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings
__label__1 it is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers  such as atheists  who do not believe in a divine being or entity  and agnostics  who hold that ultimate reality  such as god  is unknowable
__label__0 while typically not an organized group  atheists and agnostics represent a significant portion of the population
__label__1 education is a social institution through which a society s children are taught basic academic knowledge  learning skills  and cultural norms
__label__0 every nation in the world is equipped with some form of education system  though those systems vary greatly
__label__1 cultural transmission refers to the way people come to learn the values  beliefs  and social norms of their culture
__label__0 both informal and formal education include cultural transmission
__label__0 another role of schools  according to functionalist theory  is that of sorting  or classifying students based on academic merit or potential
__label__0 the most capable students are identified early in schools through testing and classroom achievements
__label__0 this hidden curriculum reinforces the positions of those with higher cultural capital and serves to bestow status unequally
__label__1 conflict theorists point to tracking  a formalized sorting system that places students on  tracks   advanced versus low achievers  that perpetuate inequalities
__label__0 while educators may believe that students do better in tracked classes because they are with students of similar ability and may have access to more individual attention from teachers  conflict theorists feel that tracking leads to self  fulfilling prophecies in which students live up  or down  to teacher and societal expectations  education week
__label__0 the findings in the coleman report were so powerful that they brought about two major changes to education in the united states
__label__0 the federal head start program  which is still active and successful today  was developed to give low  income students an opportunity to make up the preschool deficit discussed in coleman s findings
__label__1 the program provides academic  centered preschool to students of low socioeconomic status
__label__0 government leaders might have this kind of influence as well  but they also have the advantage of wielding power associated with their position in the government
__label__1 as this example indicates  there is more than one type of authority in a community  authority refers to accepted power  that is  power that people agree to follow
__label__0 people listen to authority figures because they feel that these individuals are worthy of respect
__label__0 followers accept the power of charismatic authority because they are drawn to the leader s personal qualities
__label__0 the appeal of a charismatic leader can be extraordinary  and can inspire followers to make unusual sacrifices or to persevere in the midst of great hardship and persecution
__label__0 the power held by these positions varies from one country to another
__label__1 strictly speaking  a monarchy is a government in which a single person  a monarch  rules until he or she dies or abdicates the throne
__label__0 usually  a monarch claims the rights to the title by way of hereditary succession or as a result of some sort of divine appointment or calling
__label__1 the power in an oligarchy is held by a small  elite group
__label__0 unlike in a monarchy  members of an oligarchy do not necessarily achieve their statuses based on ties to noble ancestry
__label__1 a democracy is a form of government that strives to provide all citizens with an equal voice  or vote  in determining state policy  regardless of their level of socioeconomic status
__label__0 another important fundamental of the democratic state is the establishment and governance of a just and comprehensive constitution that delineates the roles and responsibilities of leaders and citizens alike
__label__0 shortly before the voting rights act was passed  the  us supreme court case reynolds v sims changed the nature of elections
__label__1 this landmark decision reaffirmed the notion of  one person  one vote   a concept holding that all people s votes should be counted equally
__label__0 this allows for exchange of chemical messengers between the different cell types
__label__0 for example  the dct ascending limb of the loop of henle has masses of cells called macula densa  which are in contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called juxtaglomerular cells
__label__1 together  the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells form the juxtaglomerular complex  jgc
__label__0 they are similar to flame cells in that they have a tubule with cilia
__label__0 excretion occurs through a pore called the nephridiopore
__label__0 they are more evolved than the flame cells in that they have a system for tubular reabsorption by a capillary network before excretion
__label__0 excess nitrogen is excreted from the body
__label__0 nitrogenous wastes tend to form toxic ammonia  which raises the ph of body fluids
__label__0 the formation of ammonia itself requires energy in the form of atp and large quantities of water to dilute it out of a biological system
__label__0 goutmammals use uric acid crystals as an antioxidant in their cells
__label__1 however  too much uric acid tends to form kidney stones and may also cause a painful condition called gout  where uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 the immune system comprises both innate and adaptive immune responses
__label__1 innate immunity occurs naturally because of genetic factors or physiology  it is not induced by infection or vaccination but works to reduce the workload for the adaptive immune response
__label__0 both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins  receptor  mediated signaling  and intricate cell  to  cell communication
__label__1 a macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens
__label__0 macrophages recognize pamps via complementary pattern recognition receptors  prrs
__label__1 prrs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment
__label__1 a second class of early  acting cytokines is interferons  which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby uninfected cells
__label__0 one of the functions of an interferon is to inhibit viral replication
__label__0 they also have other important functions  such as tumor surveillance
__label__1 neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes  and they contain organelles  called lysosomes  that digest engulfed pathogens
__label__1 an eosinophil is a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a parasite  it is involved in the allergic response and in protection against helminthes  parasitic worms
__label__1 lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large  darkly staining nuclei  they are small cells with very little cytoplasm  as shown in  link
__label__1 infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer  nk  cells  lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells  abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue
__label__1 infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer  nk  cells  lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells  abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue
__label__1 t cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland  and b cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow
__label__0 nk cells identify intracellular infections  especially from viruses  by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class  mhc  i molecules on the surface of infected cells
__label__1 mhc i molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells  thus they are scarce on red blood cells and platelets which are non  nucleated
__label__0 granzymes are released along with the perforin in the immunological synapse
__label__1 a granzyme is a protease that digests cellular proteins and induces the target cell to undergo programmed cell death  or apoptosis
__label__1 a granzyme is a protease that digests cellular proteins and induces the target cell to undergo programmed cell death  or apoptosis
__label__0 phagocytic cells then digest the cell debris left behind
__label__0 the adaptive  or acquired  immune response takes days or even weeks to become established  much longer than the innate response  however  adaptive immunity is more specific to pathogens and has memory
__label__1 adaptive immunity is an immunity that occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a vaccination
__label__0 this part of the immune system is activated when the innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection
__label__1 the innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens  and then inform the adaptive immune response about the presence of these antigens
__label__1 an antigen  presenting cell  apc  is an immune cell that detects  engulfs  and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection
__label__0 when a pathogen is detected  these apcs will phagocytose the pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen
__label__0 these molecules are important because they regulate how a t cell will interact with and respond to an apc
__label__1 nave cd  cells bind apcs via their antigen  embedded mhc ii molecules and are stimulated to become helper t  th  lymphocytes  cells that go on to stimulate b cells  or cytotoxic t cells  directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat
__label__1 in contrast  cd  cells engage antigen  embedded mhc i molecules on apcs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic t lymphocytes  ctls   which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response
__label__0 when a th cell detects that a b cell is bound to a relevant antigen  it secretes specific cytokines that induce the b cell to proliferate rapidly  which makes thousands of identical  clonal  copies of it  and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the bcrs
__label__1 the activation of b cells corresponding to one specific bcr variant and the dramatic proliferation of that variant is known as clonal selection
__label__0 this phenomenon drastically  but briefly  changes the proportions of bcr variants expressed by the immune system  and shifts the balance toward bcrs specific to the infecting pathogen
__label__0 the immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful  unnecessary responses to harmless substances  and more importantly so that it does not attack  self
__label__1 the acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response to a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune tolerance
__label__0 immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances  such as food proteins  that apcs of the oral cavity  pharynx  and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter
__label__1 a memory cell is an antigen  specific b or t lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary immune response  but that can immediately become effector cells upon re  exposure to the same pathogen
__label__0 during the primary immune response  memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute to host defenses
__label__1 for instance  a person who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to a nonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donor s blood serum
__label__0 this phenomenon is called passive immunity  it also occurs naturally during breastfeeding  which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to infections during the first few months of life
__label__0 because an epitope corresponds to such a small region  the surface area of about four to six amino acids   it is possible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities and orientations over short regions
__label__1 cross reactivity describes when an antibody binds not to the antigen that elicited its synthesis and secretion  but to a different antigen
__label__0 thus  the kidneys control blood pressure and volume directly
__label__1 renin acts on angiotensinogen  which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin i angiotensin converting enzyme  ace  converts angiotensin i to angiotensin ii
__label__1 as previously discussed  antidiuretic hormone or adh  also called vasopressin   as the name suggests  helps the body conserve water when body fluid volume  especially that of blood  is low
__label__0 it is formed by the hypothalamus and is stored and released from the posterior pituitary
__label__1 maladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign substances or self antigens that occur after tissue sensitization are termed hypersensitivities
__label__0 the types of hypersensitivities include immediate  delayed  and autoimmunity
__label__0 most types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response
__label__1 antibodies that inappropriately mark self components as foreign are termed autoantibodies
__label__0 in patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis  muscle cell receptors that induce contraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by antibodies
__label__0 fission  also called binary fission  occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some invertebrate  multi  celled organisms
__label__1 after a period of growth  an organism splits into two separate organisms
__label__1 parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into a complete individual without being fertilized
__label__0 the resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid  depending on the process and the species
__label__0 there are three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization
__label__1 in oviparity  fertilized eggs are laid outside the female s body and develop there  receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg
__label__0 this occurs in most bony fish  many reptiles  some cartilaginous fish  most amphibians  two mammals  and all birds
__label__0 when they are released from the ovary  they travel to the uterine tubes for fertilization
__label__1 some insects have a specialized sac  called a spermatheca  which stores sperm for later use  sometimes up to a year
__label__0 fertilization can be timed with environmental or food conditions that are optimal for offspring survival
__label__0 in the male reproductive system  the scrotum houses the testicles or testes  singular  testis   including providing passage for blood vessels  nerves  and muscles related to testicular function
__label__1 in the male reproductive system  the scrotum houses the testicles or testes  singular  testis   including providing passage for blood vessels  nerves  and muscles related to testicular function
__label__1 the testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones
__label__0 each testis is approximately  by  cm   by  in  in size and divided into wedge  shaped lobules by connective tissue called septa
__label__0 these are the seminal vesicles  the prostate gland  and the bulbourethral gland  all of which are illustrated in  link
__label__1 the seminal vesicles are a pair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder
__label__0 the glands make a solution that is thick  yellowish  and alkaline
__label__1 the bulbourethral gland  or cowper s gland  releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen
__label__0 it neutralizes any acid residue in the urethra left over from urine
__label__0 the labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male
__label__1 the labia minora are thin folds of tissue centrally located within the labia majora
__label__0 these labia protect the openings to the vagina and urethra
__label__1 the vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes
__label__0 it allows menstrual flow to leave the body
__label__0 when the reproductive hormone is required  the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin  releasing hormone  gnrh  to the anterior pituitary
__label__0 this causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone  fsh  and luteinizing hormone  lh  from the anterior pituitary into the blood
__label__0 note that the body must reach puberty in order for the adrenals to release the hormones that must be present for gnrh to be produced
__label__1 testosterone  the hormone responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence  stimulates spermatogenesis
__label__0 these secondary sex characteristics include a deepening of the voice  the growth of facial  axillary  and pubic hair  and the beginnings of the sex drive
__label__0 these include breast development  flaring of the hips  and a shorter period necessary for bone maturation
__label__1 progesterone assists in endometrial re  growth and inhibition of fsh and lh release
__label__0 to ensure that no more than one sperm fertilizes the egg  once the acrosomal reactions take place at one location of the egg membrane  the egg releases proteins in other locations to prevent other sperm from fusing with the egg
__label__1 if this mechanism fails  multiple sperm can fuse with the egg  resulting in polyspermy
__label__0 the resulting embryo is not genetically viable and dies within a few days
__label__0 in mammals  the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development
__label__1 here the cells in the blastula arrange themselves in two layers  the inner cell mass  and an outer layer called the trophoblast
__label__1 the inner cell mass is also known as the embryoblast and this mass of cells will go on to form the embryo
__label__0 the outer layers of the zygote  blastocyst  grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells  and wound healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue
__label__1 another layer of the blastocyst  the chorion  begins releasing a hormone called human beta chorionic gonadotropin    hcg  which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active
__label__0 this ensures adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo
__label__1 infertility is the inability to conceive a child or carry a child to birth
__label__0 about  percent of causes of infertility can be identified  these include diseases  such as sexually transmitted diseases that can cause scarring of the reproductive tubes in either men or women  or developmental problems frequently related to abnormal hormone levels in one of the individuals
__label__0 the mesoderm that lies on either side of the vertebrate neural tube will develop into the various connective tissues of the animal body
__label__0 a spatial pattern of gene expression reorganizes the mesoderm into groups of cells called somites with spaces between them
__label__0 the somites  illustrated in  link  will further develop into the ribs  lungs  and segmental  spine  muscle
__label__0 questions about conspecific interactions often focus on competition among members of the same species for a limited resource
__label__1 ecologists also study interactions among various species  members of different species are called heterospecifics
__label__0 examples of heterospecific interactions include predation  parasitism  herbivory  competition  and pollination
__label__1 biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their distribution
__label__0 abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall vary based mainly on latitude and elevation
__label__0 the nutrients at the bottom of lakes are recycled twice each year  in the spring and fall turnover
__label__1 the spring and fall turnover is a seasonal process that recycles nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater ecosystem to the top of a body of water   link
__label__1 these turnovers are caused by the formation of a thermocline  a layer of water with a temperature that is significantly different from that of the surrounding layers
__label__1 net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food  it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration
__label__0 in terrestrial environments  net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area  which is the total mass of living plants  excluding roots
__label__0 this means that a large percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement
__label__0 the ocean is categorized by several areas or zones   link
__label__1 all of the ocean s open water is referred to as the pelagic realm  or zone
__label__1 the benthic realm  or zone  extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor
__label__1 within the pelagic realm is the photic zone  which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate  approximately  m or  ft
__label__1 at depths greater than  m  light can not penetrate  thus  this is referred to as the aphotic zone
__label__0 the majority of the ocean is aphotic and lacks sufficient light for photosynthesis
__label__0 the water here contains silt and is well  oxygenated  low in pressure  and stable in temperature
__label__1 phytoplankton and floating sargassum  a type of free  floating marine seaweed  provide a habitat for some sea life found in the neritic zone
__label__1 zooplankton  protists  small fishes  and shrimp are found in the neritic zone and are the base of the food chain for most of the world s fisheries  beyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the oceanic zone   link
__label__1 estuaries are biomes that occur where a source of fresh water  such as a river  meets the ocean
__label__0 therefore  both fresh water and salt water are found in the same vicinity  mixing results in a diluted  brackish  saltwater
__label__0 abiotic features of rivers and streams vary along the length of the river or stream
__label__0 streams begin at a point of origin referred to as source water
__label__0 the source water is usually cold  low in nutrients  and clear
__label__0 scientists who study climate have noted a series of marked changes that have gradually become increasingly evident during the last sixty years
__label__1 global climate change is the term used to describe altered global weather patterns  including a worldwide increase in temperature  due largely to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide
__label__0 greenhouse gases are probably the most significant drivers of the climate
__label__0 when heat energy from the sun strikes the earth  gases known as greenhouse gases trap the heat in the atmosphere  as do the glass panes of a greenhouse keep heat from escaping
__label__0 the greenhouse gases that affect earth include carbon dioxide  methane  water vapor  nitrous oxide  and ozone
__label__0 populations consist all of the species living within a specific area  and populations fluctuate based on a number of factors  seasonal and yearly changes in the environment  natural disasters such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions  and competition for resources between and within species
__label__1 the statistical study of population dynamics  demography  uses a series of mathematical tools to investigate how populations respond to changes in their biotic and abiotic environments
__label__0 many of these tools were originally designed to study human populations
__label__0 they are modeled after actuarial tables used by the insurance industry for estimating human life expectancy
__label__1 life tables may include the probability of individuals dying before their next birthday  ie  their mortality rate   the percentage of surviving individuals dying at a particular age interval  and their life expectancy at each interval
__label__0 an example of a life table is shown in  link  from a study of dall mountain sheep  a species native to northwestern north america
__label__0 after the third hour  there should be  bacteria in the flask  an increase of  organisms
__label__1 the important concept of exponential growth is that the population growth rate  the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation  is accelerating  that is  it is increasing at a greater and greater rate
__label__0 after  day and  of these cycles  the population would have increased from  to more than  billion
__label__1 the value  r  can be positive  meaning the population is increasing in size  or negative  meaning the population is decreasing in size  or zero  where the population s size is unchanging  a condition known as zero population growth
__label__0 a further refinement of the formula recognizes that different species have inherent differences in their intrinsic rate of increase  often thought of as the potential for reproduction   even under ideal conditions
__label__0 the age structure of a population is an important factor in population dynamics
__label__1 age structure is the proportion of a population at different age ranges
__label__0 age structure allows better prediction of population growth  plus the ability to associate this growth with the level of economic development in the region
__label__0 link  shows a variety of foul  tasting butterflies with similar coloration
__label__1 in emsleyan  mertensian mimicry  a deadly prey mimics a less dangerous one  such as the venomous coral snake mimicking the non  venomous milk snake
__label__0 this type of mimicry is extremely rare and more difficult to understand than the previous two types
__label__1 a commensal relationship occurs when one species benefits from the close  prolonged interaction  while the other neither benefits nor is harmed
__label__0 birds nesting in trees provide an example of a commensal relationship   link
__label__1 a parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it
__label__1 in this relationship  the parasite benefits  but the organism being fed upon  the host is harmed
__label__0 the host is usually weakened by the parasite as it siphons resources the host would normally use to maintain itself
__label__0 other factors influence species richness as well
__label__1 for example  the study of island biogeography attempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains  including the galpagos islands that inspired the young darwin
__label__1 relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a habitat  ecosystem  or biome
__label__1 community dynamics are the changes in community structure and composition over time
__label__0 sometimes these changes are induced by environmental disturbances such as volcanoes  earthquakes  storms  fires  and climate change
__label__0 communities with a stable structure are said to be at equilibrium
__label__1 eventually  over  years  the forest will reach its equilibrium point where species composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire
__label__0 this equilibrium state is referred to as the climax community  which will remain stable until the next disturbance
__label__0 the idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new
__label__0 animal behavior has been studied for decades  by biologists in the science of ethology  by psychologists in the science of comparative psychology  and by scientists of many disciplines in the study of neurobiology
__label__0 although there is overlap between these disciplines  scientists in these behavioral fields take different approaches
__label__1 another activity or movement of innate behavior is kinesis  or the undirected movement in response to a stimulus
__label__1 orthokinesis is the increased or decreased speed of movement of an organism in response to a stimulus
__label__1 migration is the long  range seasonal movement of animals
__label__0 it is an evolved  adapted response to variation in resource availability  and it is a common phenomenon found in all major groups of animals
__label__1 courtship displays are a series of ritualized visual behaviors  signals  designed to attract and convince a member of the opposite sex to mate
__label__0 these displays are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom
__label__0 thus  it is of fitness benefit for the worker to maintain the queen without having any direct chance of passing on its genes due to its sterility
__label__1 the lowering of individual fitness to enhance the reproductive fitness of a relative and thus one s inclusive fitness evolves through kin selection
__label__0 this phenomenon can explain many superficially altruistic behaviors seen in animals
__label__1 polygynous mating refers to one male mating with multiple females
__label__0 in these situations  the female must be responsible for most of the parental care as the single male is not capable of providing care to that many offspring
__label__0 imprinting
__label__1 imprinting is a type of learning that occurs at a particular age or a life stage that is rapid and independent of the species involved
__label__0 hatchling ducks recognize the first adult they see  their mother  and make a bond with her
__label__1 in operant conditioning  the conditioned behavior is gradually modified by its consequences as the animal responds to the stimulus
__label__0 a major proponent of such conditioning was psychologist bf skinner  the inventor of the skinner box
__label__0 furthermore  some animals must expend energy caring for their offspring
__label__0 thus  all species have an energy budget  they must balance energy intake with their use of energy for metabolism  reproduction  parental care  and energy storage  such as bears building up body fat for winter hibernation
__label__0 parental care and fecundity
__label__1 iteroparity describes species that reproduce repeatedly during their lives
__label__0 some animals are able to mate only once per year  but survive multiple mating seasons
__label__1 k  selected species are species selected by stable  predictable environments
__label__0 populations of k  selected species tend to exist close to their carrying capacity  hence the term k  selected  where intraspecific competition is high
__label__1 the ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances is called resistance
__label__1 the speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium after being disturbed  called its resilience
__label__0 ecosystem resistance and resilience are especially important when considering human impact
__label__1 in many ecosystems  the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms  plants and  or phytoplankton   which are called primary producers
__label__1 the organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores  the primary consumers
__label__1 secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers
__label__1 tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores
__label__1 higher  level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels  and so on  up to the organisms at the top of the food chain  the apex consumers
__label__0 when you are ready to create a simulation  in the upper  right corner of the interactive labs box  click open simulator
__label__0 two general types of food webs are often shown interacting within a single ecosystem
__label__1 a grazing food web  such as the lake ontario food web in  link   has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base  followed by herbivores and various carnivores
__label__1 a detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter  dead organisms   called decomposers or detritivores
__label__1 a detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter  dead organisms   called decomposers or detritivores
__label__1 a holistic ecosystem model attempts to quantify the composition  interaction  and dynamics of entire ecosystems  it is the most representative of the ecosystem in its natural state
__label__0 a food web is an example of a holistic ecosystem model
__label__0 analytical and simulation models  in contrast  are mathematical methods of describing ecosystems that are indeed capable of predicting the effects of potential environmental changes without direct experimentation  although with some limitations as to accuracy
__label__1 an analytical model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics
__label__1 a simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics
__label__0 productivity within trophic levels
__label__1 productivity within an ecosystem can be defined as the percentage of energy entering the ecosystem incorporated into biomass in a particular trophic level
__label__1 biomass is the total mass  in a unit area at the time of measurement  of living or previously living organisms within a trophic level
__label__0 ecosystems have characteristic amounts of biomass at each trophic level
__label__0 another main parameter that is important in characterizing energy flow within an ecosystem is the net production efficiency
__label__1 net production efficiency  npe  allows ecologists to quantify how efficiently organisms of a particular trophic level incorporate the energy they receive into biomass  it is calculated using the following formula
__label__0 the structure of ecosystems can be visualized with ecological pyramids  which were first described by the pioneering studies of charles elton in the s
__label__1 ecological pyramids show the relative amounts of various parameters  such as number of organisms  energy  and biomass  across trophic levels
__label__0 water contains hydrogen and oxygen  which is essential to all living processes
__label__1 the hydrosphere is the area of the earth where water movement and storage occurs  as liquid water on the surface and beneath the surface or frozen  rivers  lakes  oceans  groundwater  polar ice caps  and glaciers   and as water vapor in the atmosphere
__label__0 carbon is found in all organic macromolecules and is an important constituent of fossil fuels
__label__0 another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land  including land beneath the surface of the ocean  by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems
__label__1 carbon sediments from the ocean floor are taken deep within the earth by the process of subduction  the movement of one tectonic plate beneath another
__label__0 carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal vents
__label__0 atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide  so   and as rain falls through the atmosphere  sulfur is dissolved in the form of weak sulfuric acid  hso
__label__1 sulfur can also fall directly from the atmosphere in a process called fallout
__label__0 also  the weathering of sulfur  containing rocks releases sulfur into the soil
__label__0 the biologists studying cichlids in the s discovered hundreds of cichlid species representing a variety of specializations to particular habitat types and specific feeding strategies  eating plankton floating in the water  scraping and then eating algae from rocks  eating insect larvae from the bottom  and eating the eggs of other species of cichlid
__label__0 the cichlids of lake victoria are the product of an adaptive radiation
__label__1 an adaptive radiation is a rapid  less than three million years in the case of the lake victoria cichlids  branching through speciation of a phylogenetic tree into many closely related species  typically  the species  radiate  into different habitats and niches
__label__0 many genes code for proteins  which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms alive and reproducing
__label__1 genetic diversity can be measured as chemical diversity in that different species produce a variety of chemicals in their cells  both the proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism
__label__0 this chemical diversity has potential benefit for humans as a source of pharmaceuticals  so it provides one way to measure diversity that is important to human health and welfare
__label__0 it is not entirely clear how greater energy input could translate into more species
__label__1 the complexity of tropical ecosystems may promote speciation by increasing the heterogeneity  or number of ecological niches  in the tropics relative to higher latitudes
__label__0 the greater heterogeneity provides more opportunities for coevolution  specialization  and perhaps greater selection pressures leading to population differentiation
__label__0 estimates of extinction rates are hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening without observation
__label__0 the extinction of a bird or mammal is likely to be noticed by humans  especially if it has been hunted or used in some other way
__label__0 most fisheries are managed as a common  shared  resource even when the fishing territory lies within a country s territorial waters
__label__1 common resources are subject to an economic pressure known as the tragedy of the commons in which essentially no fisher has a motivation to exercise restraint in harvesting a fishery when it is not owned by that fisher
__label__0 the natural outcome of harvests of resources held in common is their overexploitation
__label__0 it now appears that the global decline in amphibian species recognized in the s is  in some part  caused by the fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis  which causes the disease chytridiomycosis   link
__label__1 projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air  subject to only the acceleration of gravity
__label__1 the object is called a projectile  and its path is called its trajectory
__label__0 both are quite different from the velocity of an airplane relative to its passengers  which should be close to zero
__label__1 relative velocities are one aspect of relativity  which is defined to be the study of how different observers moving relative to each other measure the same phenomenon
__label__0 linkb  is our first example of a free  body diagram  which is a technique used to illustrate all the external forces acting on a body
__label__1 the body is represented by a single isolated point  or free body   and only those forces acting on the body from the outside  external forces  are shown
__label__1 external forces are any outside forces that act on a body
__label__1 a free  body diagram is a drawing of all external forces acting on a body
__label__0 the answer is that a change in motion is equivalent to a change in velocity
__label__0 a change in velocity means  by definition  that there is an acceleration
__label__1 newton s first law says that a net external force causes a change in motion  thus  we see that a net external force causes acceleration
__label__1 when the net external force on an object is its weight  we say that it is in free  fall
__label__0 that is  the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity
__label__0 section summarynewton s third law of motion represents a basic symmetry in nature
__label__1 it states  whenever one body exerts a force on a second body  the first body experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that the first body exerts
__label__1 a tension is a force along the length of a medium  especially a force carried by a flexible medium  such as a rope or cable
__label__0 the word  tension  comes from a latin word meaning  to stretch
__label__0 not coincidentally  the flexible cords that carry muscle forces to other parts of the body are called tendons
__label__0 you feel a smaller drag force when you tilt your hand so only the side goes through the air  you have decreased the area of your hand that faces the direction of motion
__label__0 like friction  the drag force always opposes the motion of an object
__label__0 unlike simple friction  the drag force is proportional to some function of the velocity of the object in that fluid
__label__0 consider a line from the center of the cd to its edge
__label__0 each pit used to record sound along this line moves through the same angle in the same amount of time
__label__1 the rotation angle is the amount of rotation and is analogous to linear distance
__label__1 any net force causing uniform circular motion is called a centripetal force
__label__0 the direction of a centripetal force is toward the center of curvature  the same as the direction of centripetal acceleration
__label__0 to comprehend these vast ranges  we must also have accepted units in which to express them
__label__0 and we shall find that  even in the potentially mundane discussion of meters  kilograms  and seconds  a profound simplicity of nature appears  all physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of only four fundamental physical quantities  length  mass  time  and electric current
__label__0 we define a physical quantity either by specifying how it is measured or by stating how it is calculated from other measurements
__label__0 for example  we define distance and time by specifying methods for measuring them  whereas we define average speed by stating that it is calculated as distance traveled divided by time of travel
__label__1 it is an intriguing fact that some physical quantities are more fundamental than others and that the most fundamental physical quantities can be defined only in terms of the procedure used to measure them
__label__0 the units in which they are measured are thus called fundamental units
__label__0 in this textbook  the fundamental physical quantities are taken to be length  mass  time  and electric current
__label__0 the si unit for length is the meter  abbreviated m   its definition has also changed over time to become more accurate and precise
__label__0 the meter was first defined in  as    of the distance from the equator to the north pole
__label__1 the term order of magnitude refers to the scale of a value expressed in the metric system
__label__0 each power of  size
__label__1 a model is a representation of something that is often too difficult  or impossible  to display directly
__label__0 while a model is justified with experimental proof  it is only accurate under limited situations
__label__0 as scientists inquire and gather information about the world  they follow a process called the scientific method
__label__0 this process typically begins with an observation and question that the scientist will research
__label__0 these theories deal with the very fast and the very small  respectively
__label__0 relativity must be used whenever an object is traveling at greater than about   of the speed of light or experiences a strong gravitational field such as that near the sun
__label__0 quantum mechanics must be used for objects smaller than can be seen with a microscope
__label__1 average velocity is displacement  change in position  divided by the time of travel
__label__0 for example  for this trip to the store  the position  velocity  and speed  vstime graphs are displayed in  link
__label__0 note that these graphs depict a very simplified model of the trip
__label__0 we are assuming that speed is constant during the trip  which is unrealistic given that we ll probably stop at the store
__label__1 when an object slows down  its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its motion
__label__0 this is known as deceleration
__label__0 a subway train in sao paulo  brazil  decelerates as it comes into a station
__label__0 first note that graphs in this text have perpendicular axes  one horizontal and the other vertical
__label__0 when two physical quantities are plotted against one another in such a graph  the horizontal axis is usually considered to be an independent variable and the vertical axis a dependent variable
__label__0 if we call the horizontal axis the xx size x     axis and the vertical axis the y y size   y     axis  as in  link   a straight  line graph has the general form y  m x  b
__label__0 y  m x  b
__label__0 size   y  ital
__label__0 these measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the correct value of  inches
__label__0 in contrast  if you had obtained a measurement of  inches  your measurement would not be very accurate
__label__1 the precision of a measurement system is refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements  which are repeated under the same conditions
__label__0 consider the example of the paper measurements
__label__0 
__label__0 using the method of significant figures  the rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty
__label__0 in order to determine the number of significant digits in a value  start with the first measured value at the left and count the number of digits through the last digit written on the right
__label__0 distance is an example of a scalar quantity
__label__1 a vector is any quantity with both magnitude and direction
__label__0 other examples of vectors include a velocity of  km  h east and a force of  newtons straight down
__label__0 the head  to  tail method is a graphical way to add vectors  described in  link  below and in the steps following
__label__0 the tail of the vector is the starting point of the vector  and the head  or tip  of a vector is the final  pointed end of the arrow  head  to  tail method  the head  to  tail method of graphically adding vectors is illustrated for the two displacements of the person walking in a city considered in  link
__label__0 step
__label__0 to get the magnitude of the resultant  measure its length with a ruler
__label__0 note that in most calculations  we will use the pythagorean theorem to determine this length
__label__0 size         north of east
__label__0 this is an example of multiplying a vector by a positive scalar
__label__0 notice that the magnitude changes  but the direction stays the same
__label__0 if the scalar is negative  then multiplying a vector by it changes the vector s magnitude and gives the new vector the opposite direction
__label__0 analytical methods of vector addition and subtraction employ geometry and simple trigonometry rather than the ruler and protractor of graphical methods
__label__0 part of the graphical technique is retained  because vectors are still represented by arrows for easy visualization
__label__0 rather than contradicting our experience  newton s first law of motion states that there must be a cause  which is a net external force  for there to be any change in velocity  either a change in magnitude or direction
__label__0 we will define net external force in the next section
__label__0 it is obviously more difficult to change the motion of a large boulder than that of a basketball  for example
__label__0 the inertia of an object is measured by its mass
__label__0 roughly speaking  mass is a measure of the amount of  stuff   or matter  in something
__label__1 inertia is the tendency of an object to remain at rest or remain in motion
__label__0 inertia is related to an object s mass
__label__0 what is it that carries forces between objects
__label__0 one way to answer this question is to imagine that a force field surrounds whatever object creates the force
__label__0 a second object  often called a test object  placed in this field will experience a force that is a function of location and other variables
__label__0 one of the simpler characteristics of friction is that it is parallel to the contact surface between systems and always in a direction that opposes motion or attempted motion of the systems relative to each other
__label__1 if two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another  then the friction between them is called kinetic friction
__label__0 for example  friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice
__label__0 the physicist chooses earth because it is very nearly an inertial frame of reference  one in which all forces are real  that is  in which all forces have an identifiable physical origin
__label__0 in such a frame of reference  newton s laws of motion take the form given in dynamics  newton s laws of motion the car is a non  inertial frame of reference because it is accelerated to the side
__label__0 the force to the left sensed by car passengers is a fictitious force having no physical origin
__label__0 a person standing next to the merry  go  round sees the ball moving straight and the merry  go  round rotating underneath it
__label__0 in the merry  go  round s frame of reference  we explain the apparent curve to the right by using a fictitious force  called the coriolis force  that causes the ball to curve to the right
__label__0 the fictitious coriolis force can be used by anyone in that frame of reference to explain why objects follow curved paths and allows us to apply newton s laws in non  inertial frames of reference
__label__0 looking down on the counterclockwise rotation of a merry  go  round  we see that a ball slid straight toward the edge follows a path curved to the right
__label__1 microgravity refers to an environment in which the apparent net acceleration of a body is small compared with that produced by earth at its surface
__label__0 many interesting biology and physics topics have been studied over the past three decades in the presence of microgravity
__label__0 for work  in the scientific sense  to be done  a force must be exerted and there must be displacement in the direction of the force
__label__0 formally  the work done on a system by a constant force is defined to be the product of the component of the force in the direction of motion times the distance through which the force acts
__label__0 for one  way motion in one dimension  this is expressed in equation form as
__label__0 work is done by a force  and some forces  such as weight  have special characteristics
__label__1 a conservative force is one  like the gravitational force  for which work done by or against it depends only on the starting and ending points of a motion and not on the path taken
__label__0 we can define a potential energy  pe   pe  size
__label__0 conservative forces were discussed in conservative forces and potential energy
__label__1 a nonconservative force is one for which work depends on the path taken
__label__0 friction is a good example of a nonconservative force
__label__0 many of these will be covered in later chapters  but let us detail a few here
__label__0 electrical energy is a common form that is converted to many other forms and does work in a wide range of practical situations
__label__0 fuels  such as gasoline and food  carry chemical energy that can be transferred to a system through oxidation
__label__0 we sometimes refer to this as radiant energy  or electromagnetic radiation  which includes visible light  infrared  and ultraviolet radiation
__label__0 nuclear energy comes from processes that convert measurable amounts of mass into energy
__label__0 nuclear energy is transformed into the energy of sunlight  into electrical energy in power plants  and into the energy of the heat transfer and blast in weapons
__label__1 the rate at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do different activities is called the metabolic rate
__label__1 the total energy conversion rate of a person at rest is called the basal metabolic rate  bmr  and is divided among various systems in the body  as shown in  link
__label__0 the largest fraction goes to the liver and spleen  with the brain coming next
__label__1 renewable forms of energy are those sources that can not be used up  such as water  wind  solar  and biomass
__label__0 about   of our energy comes from nonrenewable fossil fuels  oil  natural gas  coal
__label__0 the likelihood of a link between global warming and fossil fuel use  with its production of carbon dioxide through combustion  has made  in the eyes of many scientists  a shift to non  fossil fuels of utmost importance  but it will not be easy
__label__0 in  link   a very large force acting for a short time had a great effect on the momentum of the tennis ball
__label__0 a small force could cause the same change in momentum  but it would have to act for a much longer time
__label__0 for example  if the ball were thrown upward  the gravitational force  which is much smaller than the tennis racquet s force  would eventually reverse the momentum of the ball
__label__0 we start with the elastic collision of two objects moving along the same line  a one  dimensional problem
__label__1 an elastic collision is one that also conserves internal kinetic energy
__label__1 internal kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the objects in the system
__label__1 internal kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the objects in the system
__label__0 we will not consider such rotation until later  and so for now we arrange things so that no rotation is possible
__label__1 to avoid rotation  we consider only the scattering of point masses  that is  structureless particles that can not rotate or spin
__label__0 we start by assuming that
__label__1 a system is in unstable equilibrium if  when displaced  it experiences a net force or torque in the same direction as the displacement from equilibrium
__label__0 a system in unstable equilibrium accelerates away from its equilibrium position if displaced even slightly
__label__0 the wheel s rotational motion is exactly analogous to the fact that the motorcycle s large translational acceleration produces a large final velocity  and the distance traveled will also be large  kinematics is the description of motion
__label__1 the kinematics of rotational motion describes the relationships among rotation angle  angular velocity  angular acceleration  and time
__label__0 let us start by finding an equation relating   size          size        and t t size   t
__label__0 clearly  the motor had to work to get the stone spinning
__label__0 this work went into heat  light  sound  vibration  and considerable rotational kinetic energy
__label__0 what is the direction of the angular momentum of a rotating object like the disk in  link
__label__0 the figure shows the right  hand rule used to find the direction of both angular momentum and angular velocity
__label__0 both l l size   l    and   size       are vectors  each has direction and magnitude
__label__0 you have no doubt heard the word pressure being used in relation to blood  high or low blood pressure  and in relation to the weather  high and low  pressure weather systems
__label__0 these are only two of many examples of pressures in fluids
__label__0 blood pressure measurements  like tire pressures  are thus made relative to atmospheric pressure
__label__0 in brief  it is very common for pressure gauges to ignore atmospheric pressure  that is  to read zero at atmospheric pressure
__label__1 we therefore define gauge pressure to be the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure
__label__0 gauge pressure is positive for pressures above atmospheric pressure  and negative for pressures below it
__label__0 that he stated this principle long before concepts of force were well established
__label__1 stated in words  archimedes  principle is as follows  the buoyant force on an object equals the weight of the fluid it displaces
__label__0 in equation form  archimedes  principle is
__label__0 liquids can  for example  be held in open containers because cohesive forces hold the molecules together
__label__1 attractive forces between molecules of different types are called adhesive forces
__label__0 such forces cause liquid drops to cling to window panes  for example
__label__0 if  however  it is too low  fainting is a problem
__label__0 systolic pressure increases dramatically during exercise to increase blood flow and returns to normal afterward
__label__0 this change produces no ill effects and  in fact  may be beneficial to the tone of the circulatory system
__label__1 the shape of the eye is maintained by fluid pressure  called intraocular pressure  which is normally in the range of  to  mm hg
__label__1 when the circulation of fluid in the eye is blocked  it can lead to a buildup in pressure  a condition called glaucoma
__label__0 the net pressure can become as great as  mm hg  an abnormally large pressure that can permanently damage the optic nerve
__label__1 the relationship between pressure and velocity in fluids is described quantitatively by bernoulli s equation  named after its discoverer  the swiss scientist daniel bernoulli
__label__0 bernoulli s equation states that for an incompressible  frictionless fluid  the following sum is constant
__label__1 laminar flow is characterized by the smooth flow of the fluid in layers that do not mix
__label__1 turbulent flow  or turbulence  is characterized by eddies and swirls that mix layers of fluid together
__label__0 one of the consequences of viscosity is a resistance force called viscous drag
__label__0 membranes are generally selectively permeable  or semipermeable
__label__0 see  link
__label__1 reverse osmosis and reverse dialysis  also called filtration  are processes that occur when back pressure is sufficient to reverse the normal direction of substances through membranes
__label__0 back pressure can be created naturally as on the right side of  link
__label__0 the scientific definition of temperature is less ambiguous than your senses of hot and cold
__label__1 temperature is operationally defined to be what we measure with a thermometer
__label__0 many physical quantities are defined solely in terms of how they are measured
__label__0 that is  heat will flow from the hotter object to the cooler one until they have exactly the same temperature
__label__0 the objects are then in thermal equilibrium  and no further changes will occur
__label__0 the systems interact and change because their temperatures differ  and the changes stop once their temperatures are the same
__label__0 thermal stress is created by thermal expansion or contraction  see elasticity  stress and strain for a discussion of stress and strain
__label__0 thermal stress can be destructive  such as when expanding gasoline ruptures a tank
__label__1 we can examine aspects of the behavior of a substance by plotting a graph of pressure versus volume  called a pv diagram
__label__0 when the substance behaves like an ideal gas  the ideal gas law describes the relationship between its pressure and volume
__label__0 for water  there is no liquid phase at pressures below  atm
__label__1 the phase change from solid to gas is called sublimation
__label__0 it accounts for large losses of snow pack that never make it into a river  the routine automatic defrosting of a freezer  and the freeze  drying process applied to many foods
__label__1 partial pressure is defined as the pressure a gas would create if it occupied the total volume available
__label__1 in a mixture of gases  the total pressure is the sum of partial pressures of the component gases  assuming ideal gas behavior and no chemical reactions between the components
__label__1 relative humidity tells us how much water vapor is in the air compared with the maximum possible
__label__0 at its maximum  denoted as saturation  the relative humidity is    and evaporation is inhibited
__label__0 the amount of water vapor in the air depends on temperature
__label__0 the transfer of energy is caused by the temperature difference  and ceases once the temperatures are equal
__label__1 these observations lead to the following definition of heat  heat is the spontaneous transfer of energy due to a temperature difference
__label__0 as noted in temperature  kinetic theory  and the gas laws  heat is often confused with temperature
__label__1 conduction is heat transfer through stationary matter by physical contact
__label__0 the matter is stationary on a macroscopic scale  we know there is thermal motion of the atoms and molecules at any temperature above absolute zero
__label__0 that is  the hot body emits electromagnetic waves that are absorbed by our skin  no medium is required for electromagnetic waves to propagate
__label__0 different names are used for electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths  radio waves  microwaves  infrared radiation  visible light  ultraviolet radiation  x  rays  and gamma rays
__label__0 most of the heat transfer from this fire to the observers is through infrared radiation
__label__0 the visible light  although dramatic  transfers relatively little thermal energy
__label__0 the first law of thermodynamics applies the conservation of energy principle to systems where heat transfer and doing work are the methods of transferring energy into and out of the system
__label__1 the first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy of a system equals the net heat transfer into the system minus the net work done by the system
__label__0 in equation form  the first law of thermodynamics is
__label__1 pv diagrams and their relationship to work done on or by a gasa process by which a gas does work on a piston at constant pressure is called an isobaric process
__label__0 since the pressure is constant  the force exerted is constant and the work done is given as p  v
__label__0 p  v  size   p  v
__label__0 both isothermal and adiabatic processes such as shown in  link  are reversible in principle
__label__1 a reversible process is one in which both the system and its environment can return to exactly the states they were in by following the reverse path
__label__0 the reverse isothermal and adiabatic paths are ba and ca  respectively
__label__0 this question was answered at a theoretical level in  by a young french engineer  sadi carnot       in his study of the then  emerging heat engine technology crucial to the industrial revolution
__label__0 he devised a theoretical cycle  now called the carnot cycle  which is the most efficient cyclical process possible
__label__0 the second law of thermodynamics can be restated in terms of the carnot cycle  and so what carnot actually discovered was this fundamental law
__label__0 there is yet another way of expressing the second law of thermodynamics
__label__0 this version relates to a concept called entropy
__label__0 by examining it  we shall see that the directions associated with the second law  heat transfer from hot to cold  for example  are related to the tendency in nature for systems to become disordered and for less energy to be available for use as work
__label__0 link  lists of all the ways in which  coins can be tossed  taking into account the order in which heads and tails occur
__label__1 each sequence is called a microstate  a detailed description of every element of a system
__label__0 some oscillations create waves
__label__0 a guitar creates sound waves
__label__0 they are also the simplest oscillatory systems
__label__1 simple harmonic motion  shm  is the name given to oscillatory motion for a system where the net force can be described by hooke s law  and such a system is called a simple harmonic oscillator
__label__1 simple harmonic motion  shm  is the name given to oscillatory motion for a system where the net force can be described by hooke s law  and such a system is called a simple harmonic oscillator
__label__0 if the net force can be described by hooke s law and there is no damping  by friction or other non  conservative forces   then a simple harmonic oscillator will oscillate with equal displacement on either side of the equilibrium position  as shown for an object on a spring in  link
__label__1 with less  than critical damping  the system will return to equilibrium faster but will overshoot and cross over one or more times
__label__0 such a system is underdamped  its displacement is represented by the curve in  link
__label__0 curve b in  link  represents an overdamped system
__label__0 when you drive the ball at its natural frequency  the ball s oscillations increase in amplitude with each oscillation for as long as you drive it
__label__1 the phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called resonance
__label__1 a system being driven at its natural frequency is said to resonate
__label__0 the water wave in the figure also has a length associated with it  called its wavelength
__label__0 luckily  the rules for adding waves are quite simple  when two or more waves arrive at the same point  they superimpose themselves on one another
__label__1 more specifically  the disturbances of waves are superimposed when they come together  a phenomenon called superposition
__label__0 each disturbance corresponds to a force  and forces add
__label__1 if the two waves have the same amplitude and wavelength  then they alternate between constructive and destructive interference
__label__0 the resultant looks like a wave standing in place and  thus  is called a standing wave
__label__0 waves on the glass of milk are one example of standing waves
__label__0 therefore  the fundamental frequency is f  v w     v w   l f  v w     v w   l size   f rsub  size       v rsub  size   w     rsub  size       v rsub  size   w
__label__0 in this case  the overtones or harmonics are multiples of the fundamental frequency
__label__0 as seen in  link   the first harmonic can easily be calculated since    l    l size    rsub  size       l
__label__1 the physical phenomenon of sound is defined to be a disturbance of matter that is transmitted from its source outward
__label__0 sound is a wave
__label__0 real lenses behave somewhat differently from how they are modeled using the thin lens equations  producing aberrations
__label__1 an aberration is a distortion in an image
__label__1 the lowest resonant frequency is called the fundamental  while all higher resonant frequencies are called overtones
__label__1 all resonant frequencies are integral multiples of the fundamental  and they are collectively called harmonics
__label__0 the fundamental is the first harmonic  the first overtone is the second harmonic  and so on
__label__0 the reason is that each instrument produces a distinctive set of frequencies and intensities
__label__0 we call our perception of these combinations of frequencies and intensities tone quality  or more commonly the timbre of the sound
__label__0 it is more difficult to correlate timbre perception to physical quantities than it is for loudness or pitch perception
__label__0 franklin wrote in his letters and books that he could see the effects of electric charge but did not understand what caused the phenomenon
__label__0 today we have the advantage of knowing that normal matter is made of atoms  and that atoms contain positive and negative charges  usually in equal amounts
__label__0 link  shows a simple model of an atom with negative electrons orbiting its positive nucleus
__label__0 the nucleus is positive due to the presence of positively charged protons
__label__1 some of the electrons in metals and similar conductors are not bound to individual atoms or sites in the material
__label__0 these free electrons can move through the material much as air moves through loose sand
__label__0 any substance that has free electrons and allows charge to move relatively freely through it is called a conductor
__label__0 electrostatic repulsion in the leaves of the charged electroscope separates them
__label__0 we use a variety of cues in a visual scene to establish our sense of depth
__label__1 some of these are binocular cues  which means that they rely on the use of both eyes
__label__1 one example of a binocular depth cue is binocular disparity  the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives
__label__0 the inner ear contains the semi  circular canals  which are involved in balance and movement  the vestibular sense   and the cochlea
__label__1 the cochlea is a fluid  filled  snail  shaped structure that contains the sensory receptor cells  hair cells  of the auditory system   link
__label__0 we ll discuss two of them here  temporal theory and place theory
__label__1 the temporal theory of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by the activity level of a sensory neuron
__label__0 this would mean that a given hair cell would fire action potentials related to the frequency of the sound wave
__label__0 localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields
__label__1 like the monocular and binocular cues that provided information about depth  the auditory system uses both monaural  one  eared  and binaural  two  eared  cues to localize sound
__label__1 deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear
__label__1 some people are born deaf  which is known as congenital deafness
__label__1 when the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain  it is called sensorineural hearing loss
__label__0 one disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is mnire s disease
__label__0 this kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids  but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option
__label__1 cochlear implants are electronic devices that consist of a microphone  a speech processor  and an electrode array
__label__0 the device receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to transmit information to the brain
__label__0 you have learned since elementary school that there are four basic groupings of taste  sweet  salty  sour  and bitter
__label__0 research demonstrates  however  that we have at least six taste groupings
__label__0 umami is our fifth taste
__label__1 olfactory receptor cells are located in a mucous membrane at the top of the nose
__label__0 small hair  like extensions from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical receptors located on these extensions   link
__label__0 these receptors include meissner s corpuscles  pacinian corpuscles  merkel s disks  and ruffini corpuscles
__label__1 meissner s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations  and pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations
__label__1 merkel s disks respond to light pressure  while ruffini corpuscles detect stretch  abraira  ginty
__label__0 there are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin  each attuned to specific touch  related stimuli
__label__0 generally speaking  pain can be considered to be neuropathic or inflammatory in nature
__label__1 pain that signals some type of tissue damage is known as inflammatory pain
__label__0 in some situations  pain results from damage to neurons of either the peripheral or central nervous system
__label__1 the vestibular sense contributes to our ability to maintain balance and body posture
__label__0 as  link  shows  the major sensory organs  utricle  saccule  and the three semicircular canals  of this system are located next to the cochlea in the inner ear
__label__0 one gestalt principle is the figure  ground relationship
__label__1 according to this principle  we tend to segment our visual world into figure and ground
__label__0 two additional gestalt principles are the law of continuity  or good continuation  and closure
__label__1 the law of continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous  smooth flowing lines rather than jagged  broken lines   link
__label__0 you probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world  but this is not always the case
__label__1 our perceptions are based on perceptual hypotheses  educated guesses that we make while interpreting sensory information
__label__0 these hypotheses are informed by a number of factors  including our personalities  experiences  and expectations
__label__0 both instincts and reflexes are innate behaviors that organisms are born with
__label__1 reflexes are a motor or neural reaction to a specific stimulus in the environment
__label__0 they tend to be simpler than instincts  involve the activity of specific body parts and systems  eg  the knee  jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light   and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system  eg  the spinal cord and the medulla
__label__0 our minds have a natural tendency to connect events that occur closely together or in sequence
__label__1 associative learning occurs when an organism makes connections between stimuli or events that occur together in the environment
__label__0 you will see that associative learning is central to all three basic learning processes discussed in this chapter  classical conditioning tends to involve unconscious processes  operant conditioning tends to involve conscious processes  and observational learning adds social and cognitive layers to all the basic associative processes  both conscious and unconscious
__label__0 pavlov       a russian scientist  performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning   link
__label__1 as we discussed briefly in the previous section  classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and  consequently  to anticipate events
__label__0 ivan pavlov s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning
__label__0 
__label__0 pavlov would sound a tone  like ringing a bell  and then give the dogs the meat powder   link
__label__1 the tone was the neutral stimulus  ns   which is a stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response
__label__0 prior to conditioning  the dogs did not salivate when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association for the dogs
__label__0 tiger will learn to get excited when she hears the  squeak  of the cabinet
__label__1 pairing a new neutral stimulus   squeak   with the conditioned stimulus   zzhzhz   is called higher  order conditioning  or second  order conditioning
__label__0 this means you are using the conditioned stimulus of the can opener to condition another stimulus  the squeaky cabinet   link
__label__0 soon the dogs stopped responding to the tone
__label__1 extinction is the decrease in the conditioned response when the unconditioned stimulus is no longer presented with the conditioned stimulus
__label__0 when presented with the conditioned stimulus alone  the dog  cat  or other organism would show a weaker and weaker response  and finally no response
__label__1 on the other hand  when an organism demonstrates the conditioned response to stimuli that are similar to the condition stimulus  it is called stimulus generalization  the opposite of stimulus discrimination
__label__0 the more similar a stimulus is to the condition stimulus  the more likely the organism is to give the conditioned response
__label__0 his idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect  which was first proposed by psychologist edward thorndike
__label__1 according to the law of effect  behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated  and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated  thorndike
__label__0 essentially  if an organism does something that brings about a desired result  the organism is more likely to do it again
__label__0 remember that reinforcement  even when it is negative  always increases a behavior
__label__1 in contrast  punishment always decreases a behavior
__label__1 in positive punishment  you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease a behavior
__label__0 shapingin his operant conditioning experiments  skinner often used an approach called shaping
__label__1 instead of rewarding only the target behavior  in shaping  we reward successive approximations of a target behavior
__label__0 why is shaping needed
__label__1 with a variable interval reinforcement schedule  the person or animal gets the reinforcement based on varying amounts of time  which are unpredictable
__label__0 say that manuel is the manager at a fast  food restaurant
__label__0 although strict behaviorists such as skinner and watson refused to believe that cognition  such as thoughts and expectations  plays a role in learning  another behaviorist  edward c tolman  had a different opinion
__label__0 tolman s experiments with rats demonstrated that organisms can learn even if they do not receive immediate reinforcement  tolman  honzik    tolman  ritchie   kalish
__label__0 previous sections of this chapter focused on classical and operant conditioning  which are forms of associative learning
__label__1 in observational learning  we learn by watching others and then imitating  or modeling  what they do or say
__label__1 the individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models
__label__0 bandura and other researchers proposed a brand of behaviorism called social learning theory  which took cognitive processes into account
__label__0 according to bandura  pure behaviorism could not explain why learning can take place in the absence of external reinforcement
__label__0 he felt that internal mental states must also have a role in learning and that observational learning involves much more than imitation
__label__0 what are the implications of this study
__label__0 bandura concluded that we watch and learn  and that this learning can have both prosocial and antisocial effects
__label__0 prosocial  positive  models can be used to encourage socially acceptable behavior
__label__0 the different files stored in the file cabinet are called concepts
__label__1 concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information  images  ideas  or memories  such as life experiences
__label__0 concepts are  in many ways  big ideas that are generated by observing details  and categorizing and combining these details into cognitive structures
__label__1 an artificial concept  on the other hand  is a concept that is defined by a specific set of characteristics
__label__0 various properties of geometric shapes  like squares and triangles  serve as useful examples of artificial concepts
__label__1 thus  lexicon is a language s vocabulary
__label__1 grammar refers to the set of rules that are used to convey meaning through the use of the lexicon  fernndez  cairns
__label__0 for instance  english grammar dictates that most verbs receive an  ed  at the end to indicate past tense
__label__0 semantics and syntax are part of a language s grammar
__label__1 semantics refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words
__label__1 syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences  chomsky    fernndez  cairns
__label__0 b f skinner    proposed that language is learned through reinforcement
__label__0 noam chomsky    criticized this behaviorist approach  asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined
__label__0 the use of language develops in the absence of formal instruction and appears to follow a very similar pattern in children from vastly different cultures and backgrounds
__label__0 different strategies have different action plans associated with them   link
__label__0 for example  a well  known strategy is trial and error
__label__0 the old adage   if at first you do nt succeed  try  try again  describes trial and error
__label__0 the realtor may be challenging your anchoring bias
__label__1 an anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem
__label__0 in this case  you re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point
__label__1 the confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs
__label__1 hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable  even though it really was nt
__label__0 in other words  you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did
__label__1 representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking  in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something  for example  you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation  because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors
__label__1 motivation describes the wants or needs that direct behavior toward a goal
__label__1 in addition to biological motives  motivations can be intrinsic  arising from internal factors  or extrinsic  arising from external factors    link
__label__1 intrinsically motivated behaviors are performed because of the sense of personal satisfaction that they bring  while extrinsically motivated behaviors are performed in order to receive something from others
__label__1 according to the drive theory of motivation  deviations from homeostasis create physiological needs
__label__0 these needs result in psychological drive states that direct behavior to meet the need and  ultimately  bring the system back to homeostasis
__label__1 self  efficacy is an individual s belief in her own capability to complete a task  which may include a previous successful completion of the exact task or a similar task
__label__0 albert bandura    theorized that an individual s sense of self  efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior
__label__0 in the s  raymond cattell proposed a theory of intelligence that divided general intelligence into two components  crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence  cattell
__label__1 crystallized intelligence is characterized as acquired knowledge and the ability to retrieve it
__label__0 when you learn  remember  and recall information  you are using crystallized intelligence
__label__0 practical intelligence  as proposed by sternberg  is sometimes compared to  street smarts
__label__1 being practical means you find solutions that work in your everyday life by applying knowledge based on your experiences
__label__0 this type of intelligence appears to be separate from traditional understanding of iq  individuals who score high in practical intelligence may or may not have comparable scores in creative and analytical intelligence  sternberg
__label__0 multiple intelligences theory was developed by howard gardner  a harvard psychologist and former student of erik erikson
__label__0 gardner s theory  which has been refined for more than  years  is a more recent development among theories of intelligence
__label__1 creativity is the ability to generate  create  or discover new ideas  solutions  and possibilities
__label__0 very creative people often have intense knowledge about something  work on it for years  look at novel solutions  seek out the advice and help of other experts  and take risks
__label__0 for most people  once they have eaten  they feel satiation  or fullness and satisfaction  and their eating behavior stops
__label__0 like the initiation of eating  satiation is also regulated by several physiological mechanisms
__label__0 our energy expenditure is obviously affected by our levels of activity  but our body s metabolic rate also comes into play
__label__1 a person s metabolic rate is the amount of energy that is expended in a given period of time  and there is tremendous individual variability in our metabolic rates
__label__0 people with high rates of metabolism are able to burn off calories more easily than those with lower rates of metabolism
__label__1 according to the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   an adult with a body mass index  bmi  between  and  is considered overweight   link
__label__1 an adult with a bmi of  or higher is considered obese  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc
__label__1 people who are so overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese
__label__1 prader  willi syndrome  pws  is a genetic disorder that results in persistent feelings of intense hunger and reduced rates of metabolism
__label__0 typically  affected children have to be supervised around the clock to ensure that they do not engage in excessive eating
__label__1 anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through starvation andor excessive exercise
__label__0 individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image  referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia  meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though they are not
__label__1 kinsey also developed a continuum known as the kinsey scale that is still commonly used today to categorize an individual s sexual orientation  jenkins
__label__1 sexual orientation is an individual s emotional and erotic attractions to same  sexed individuals  homosexual   opposite  sexed individuals  heterosexual   or both  bisexual
__label__1 based on these observations  masters and johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that are fairly similar in men and women  excitement  plateau  orgasm  and resolution   link
__label__1 the excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle  and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal
__label__1 during plateau  women experience further swelling of the vagina and increased blood flow to the labia minora  and men experience full erection and often exhibit pre  ejaculatory fluid
__label__0 in men  pelvic contractions are accompanied by a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles   ie  ejaculation
__label__1 resolution is the relatively rapid return to an unaroused state accompanied by a decrease in blood pressure and muscular relaxation
__label__0 while many women can quickly repeat the sexual response cycle  men must pass through a longer refractory period as part of resolution
__label__0 when individuals do not feel comfortable identifying with the gender associated with their biological sex  then they experience gender dysphoria
__label__1 gender dysphoria is a diagnostic category in the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders  dsm  that describes individuals who do not identify as the gender that most people would assume they are
__label__0 this dysphoria must persist for at least six months and result in significant distress or dysfunction to meet dsm diagnostic criteria
__label__0 as a result  the test was normed and standardized  which means that the test was administered consistently to a large enough representative sample of the population that the range of scores resulted in a bell curve  bell curves will be discussed later
__label__1 standardization means that the manner of administration  scoring  and interpretation of results is consistent
__label__1 norming involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups  such as age groups
__label__0 without a large sample size  it is less likely that the bell curve will represent the wider population
__label__1 a representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately represents the general population
__label__0 if  for example  you measured the height of the women in your classroom only  you might not actually have a representative sample
__label__0 the schachter  singer two  factor theory of emotion is another variation on theories of emotions that takes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience
__label__1 according to this theory  emotions are composed of two factors  physiological and cognitive
__label__0 the biology of emotions
__label__1 earlier  you learned about the limbic system  which is the area of the brain involved in emotion and memory   link
__label__0 the limbic system includes the hypothalamus  thalamus  amygdala  and the hippocampus
__label__0 it is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value to learning processes and memory
__label__0 the central nucleus plays a role in attention  and it has connections with the hypothalamus and various brainstem areas to regulate the autonomic nervous and endocrine systems  activity  pessoa
__label__0 this would seem to suggest that the pattern of activity in facial muscles involved in generating emotional expressions is universal  and indeed  this idea was suggested in the late th century in charles darwin s book the expression of emotions in man and animals
__label__0 in fact  there is substantial evidence for seven universal emotions that are each associated with distinct facial expressions
__label__0 these include  happiness  surprise  sadness  fright  disgust  contempt  and anger   link    ekman  keltner
__label__1 personality refers to the long  standing traits and patterns that propel individuals to consistently think  feel  and behave in specific ways
__label__0 our personality is what makes us unique individuals
__label__0 according to freud  unconscious drives influenced by sex and aggression  along with childhood sexuality  are the forces that influence our personality
__label__1 freud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality
__label__0 these theorists  referred to as neo  freudians  generally agreed with freud that childhood experiences matter  but they reduced the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality
__label__1 the unconscious i d contains our most primitive drives or urges  and is present from birth
__label__0 it directs impulses for hunger  thirst  and sex
__label__0 according to freud  a person who has a strong ego  which can balance the demands of the i d and the superego  has a healthy personality
__label__1 freud maintained that imbalances in the system can lead to neurosis  a tendency to experience negative emotions   anxiety disorders  or unhealthy behaviors
__label__0 for example  a person who is dominated by their i d might be narcissistic and impulsive
__label__1 in projection  a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in someone else
__label__0 other defense mechanisms include rationalization  displacement  and sublimation
__label__0 after passing through the oral stage  children enter what freud termed the anal stage   years
__label__1 in this stage  children experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements  so it makes sense that the conflict in this stage is over toilet training
__label__0 the final stage is the genital stage  from puberty on
__label__1 in this stage  there is a sexual reawakening as the incestuous urges resurface
__label__1 he subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology  which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority
__label__0 adler      proposed the concept of the inferiority complex
__label__1 an inferiority complex refers to a person s feelings that they lack worth and do nt measure up to the standards of others or of society
__label__1 the collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious  holding mental patterns  or memory traces  which are common to all of us  jung
__label__1 the collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious  holding mental patterns  or memory traces  which are common to all of us  jung
__label__0 these ancestral memories  which jung called archetypes  are represented by universal themes in various cultures  as expressed through literature  art  and dreams  jung
__label__0 memory is an information processing system  therefore  we often compare it to a computer
__label__1 memory is the set of processes used to encode  store  and retrieve information over different periods of time   link
__label__1 encoding involves the input of information into the memory system
__label__1 storage is the retention of the encoded information
__label__1 it probably required a lot of work and attention on your part in order to encode that information
__label__0 this is known as effortful processing   link
__label__0 craik and tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic encoding  especially if we apply what is called the self  reference effect
__label__1 the self  reference effect is the tendency for an individual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself in comparison to material that has less personal relevance  rogers  kuiper  kirker
__label__0 could semantic encoding be beneficial to you as you attempt to memorize the concepts in this chapter
__label__0 in order for a memory to go into storage  ie  long  term memory   it has to pass through three distinct stages  sensory memory  short  term memory  and finally long  term memory
__label__0 these stages were first proposed by richard atkinson and richard shiffrin
__label__1 their model of human memory   link    called atkinson  shiffrin  a  s   is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer processes information
__label__1 short  term memory  stm  is a temporary storage system that processes incoming sensory memory  sometimes it is called working memory
__label__0 short  term memory takes information from sensory memory and sometimes connects that memory to something already in long  term memory
__label__0 understanding the different types is important because a person s age or particular types of brain trauma or disorders can leave certain types of ltm intact while having disastrous consequences for other types
__label__1 explicit memories are those we consciously try to remember and recall
__label__0 for example  if you are studying for your chemistry exam  the material you are learning will be part of your explicit memory
__label__1 declarative memory has to do with the storage of facts and events we personally experienced
__label__0 explicit  declarative  memory has two parts  semantic memory and episodic memory
__label__0 can you remember every event you have experienced over the course of your life  meals  conversations  clothing choices  weather conditions  and so on
__label__0 most likely none of us could even come close to answering these questions  however  american actress marilu henner  best known for the television show taxi  can remember
__label__0 she has an amazing and highly superior autobiographical memory   link
__label__0 there are three ways you can retrieve information out of your long  term memory storage system  recall  recognition  and relearning
__label__1 recall is what we most often think about when we talk about memory retrieval  it means you can access information without cues
__label__0 for example  you would use recall for an essay test
__label__0 karl lashley began exploring this problem  about  years ago  by making lesions in the brains of animals such as rats and monkeys
__label__1 he was searching for evidence of the engram  the group of neurons that serve as the  physical representation of memory   josselyn
__label__0 first  lashley    trained rats to find their way through a maze
__label__0 another group of researchers also experimented with rats to learn how the hippocampus functions in memory processing   link
__label__0 they created lesions in the hippocampi of the rats  and found that the rats demonstrated memory impairment on various tasks  such as object recognition and maze running
__label__1 it is also believed that strong emotions trigger the formation of strong memories  and weaker emotional experiences form weaker memories  this is called arousal theory  christianson
__label__0 for example  strong emotional experiences can trigger the release of neurotransmitters  as well as hormones  which strengthen memory  therefore  our memory for an emotional event is usually better than our memory for a non  emotional event
__label__0 albert bandura agreed with skinner that personality develops through learning
__label__0 he disagreed  however  with skinner s strict behaviorist approach to personality development  because he felt that thinking and reasoning are important components of learning
__label__0 bandura      has studied a number of cognitive and personal factors that affect learning and personality development  and most recently has focused on the concept of self  efficacy
__label__1 self  efficacy is our level of confidence in our own abilities  developed through our social experiences
__label__0 self  efficacy affects how we approach challenges and reach goals
__label__0 walter mischel was a student of julian rotter and taught for years at stanford  where he was a colleague of albert bandura
__label__0 mischel surveyed several decades of empirical psychological literature regarding trait prediction of behavior  and his conclusion shook the foundations of personality psychology
__label__1 retrograde amnesia is loss of memory for events that occurred prior to the trauma
__label__0 people with retrograde amnesia can not remember some or even all of their past
__label__0 in studying cases where dna evidence has exonerated people from crimes  the innocence project discovered that eyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of wrongful convictions  benjamin n cardozo school of law  yeshiva university
__label__0 
__label__1 recall of false autobiographical memories is called false memory syndrome
__label__0 this syndrome has received a lot of publicity  particularly as it relates to memories of events that do not have independent witnesses  often the only witnesses to the abuse are the perpetrator and the victim  eg  sexual abuse
__label__0 i know i read the book in high school  and i remember that one of the main characters is named scout  and her father is an attorney  but i honestly do nt remember anything else
__label__0 nathan wonders if his mother actually read the book  and his mother is surprised she ca nt recall the plot
__label__1 what is going on here is storage decay  unused information tends to fade with the passage of time
__label__0 in   german psychologist hermann ebbinghaus analyzed the process of memorization
__label__0 first  he memorized lists of nonsense syllables
__label__0 memories can also be affected by bias  which is the final distortion error
__label__0 schacter    says that your feelings and view of the world can actually distort your memory of past events
__label__0 these are examples of proactive interference  when old information hinders the recall of newly learned information
__label__1 retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of older information
__label__0 for example  this week you are studying about freud s psychoanalytic theory
__label__0 another humanistic theorist was carl rogers
__label__1 one of rogers s main ideas about personality regards self  concept  our thoughts and feelings about ourselves
__label__0 how would you respond to the question   who am i   your answer can show how you see yourself
__label__0 according to rogers      as persons are accepted and prized  they tend to develop a more caring attitude towards themselves   p
__label__1 conversely  when there is a great discrepancy between our ideal and actual selves  we experience a state rogers called incongruence  which can lead to maladjustment
__label__0 through the work of scientists in the late th century  the main features of the electrostatic force  the existence of two types of charge  the observation that like charges repel  unlike charges attract  and the decrease of force with distance  were eventually refined  and expressed as a mathematical formula
__label__1 the mathematical formula for the electrostatic force is called coulomb s law after the french physicist charles coulomb       who performed experiments and first proposed a formula to calculate it
__label__1 since the electric field has both magnitude and direction  it is a vector
__label__0 like all vectors  the electric field can be represented by an arrow that has length proportional to its magnitude and that points in the correct direction
__label__0 we have used arrows extensively to represent force vectors  for example
__label__1 conductors contain free charges that move easily
__label__0 when excess charge is placed on a conductor or the conductor is put into a static electric field  charges in the conductor quickly respond to reach a steady state called electrostatic equilibrium
__label__0 what causes the electric field
__label__1 at around  km above the surface of earth we have a layer of charged particles  called the ionosphere
__label__0 the ionosphere is responsible for a range of phenomena including the electric field surrounding earth
__label__1 on the submicroscopic scale  it is more convenient to define an energy unit called the electron volt  ev   which is the energy given to a fundamental charge accelerated through a potential difference of  v
__label__0 in equation form
__label__0 most copy machines use an electrostatic process called xerography  a word coined from the greek words xeros for dry and graphos for writing
__label__0 the heart of the process is shown in simplified form in  link
__label__0 a selenium  coated aluminum drum is sprayed with positive charge from points on a device called a corotron
__label__1 a selenium  coated aluminum drum is sprayed with positive charge from points on a device called a corotron
__label__0 laser printers use the xerographic process to make high  quality images on paper  employing a laser to produce an image on the photoconducting drum as shown in  link
__label__0 in its most common application  the laser printer receives output from a computer  and it can achieve high  quality output because of the precision with which laser light can be controlled
__label__1 while we use blue arrows to represent the magnitude and direction of the electric field  we use green lines to represent places where the electric potential is constant
__label__0 these are called equipotential lines in two dimensions  or equipotential surfaces in three dimensions
__label__0 the term equipotential is also used as a noun  referring to an equipotential line or surface
__label__1 a system composed of two identical  parallel conducting plates separated by a distance  as in  link   is called a parallel plate capacitor
__label__0 it is easy to see the relationship between the voltage and the stored charge for a parallel plate capacitor  as shown in  link
__label__0 see  link
__label__0 the si unit for current is the ampere  a   named for the french physicist andr  marie ampre
__label__1 since i  q  t i  q  t size   i  q  t     we see that an ampere is one coulomb per second
__label__0 once the current is established  it is thus also a constant
__label__1 direct current  dc  is the flow of electric charge in only one direction
__label__0 it is the steady state of a constant  voltage circuit
__label__0 there are two known hazards of electricity  thermal and shock
__label__1 a thermal hazard is one where excessive electric power causes undesired thermal effects  such as starting a fire in the wall of a house
__label__0 a shock hazard occurs when electric current passes through a person
__label__0 the interior of the body has a much lower resistance than dry skin because of all the ionic solutions and fluids it contains
__label__0 if skin resistance is bypassed  such as by an intravenous infusion  a catheter  or exposed pacemaker leads  a person is rendered microshock sensitive
__label__0 in this condition  currents about    those listed in  link  produce similar effects
__label__0 as discussed in molecular transport phenomena  diffusion  osmosis  and related processes  free ions will diffuse from a region of high concentration to one of low concentration
__label__1 but the cell membrane is semipermeable  meaning that some ions may cross it while others can not
__label__0 in its resting state  the cell membrane is permeable to k k size
__label__1 most circuits have more than one component  called a resistor that limits the flow of charge in the circuit
__label__1 a measure of this limit on charge flow is called resistance
__label__0 the simplest combinations of resistors are the series and parallel connections illustrated in  link
__label__0 link  shows resistors in parallel  wired to a voltage source
__label__1 resistors are in parallel when each resistor is connected directly to the voltage source by connecting wires having negligible resistance
__label__1 on the small scale  the potential difference creates an electric field that exerts force on charges  causing current
__label__0 we thus use the name electromotive force  abbreviated emf
__label__1 kirchhoff s rules for circuit analysis are applications of conservation laws to circuits
__label__0 the first rule is the application of conservation of charge  while the second rule is the application of conservation of energy
__label__1 voltmeters measure voltage  whereas ammeters measure current
__label__0 some of the meters in automobile dashboards  digital cameras  cell phones  and tuner  amplifiers are voltmeters or ammeters
__label__0 voltmeters draw some extra current  whereas ammeters reduce current flow
__label__1 null measurements balance voltages so that there is no current flowing through the measuring device and  therefore  no alteration of the circuit being measured
__label__1 the wheatstone bridge is a null measurement device for calculating resistance by balancing potential drops in a circuit
__label__0 see  link
__label__0 other materials exhibit weak magnetic effects  which are detectable only with sensitive instruments
__label__0 not only do ferromagnetic materials respond strongly to magnets  the way iron is attracted to magnets   they can also be magnetized themselves  that is  they can be induced to be magnetic or made into permanent magnets
__label__0 an unmagnetized piece of iron is placed between two magnets  heated  and then cooled  or simply tapped when cold
__label__1 the iron becomes a permanent magnet with the poles aligned as shown  its south pole is adjacent to the north pole of the original magnet  and its north pole is adjacent to the south pole of the original magnet
__label__0 this was the first significant evidence that the movement of charges had any connection with magnets
__label__1 electromagnetism is the use of electric current to make magnets
__label__1 these temporarily induced magnets are called electromagnets
__label__0 his ability to think deeply and clearly about action at a distance  particularly for gravitational  electric  and magnetic forces  later enabled him to create his revolutionary theory of relativity
__label__0 since magnetic forces act at a distance  we define a magnetic field to represent magnetic forces
__label__0 the pictorial representation of magnetic field lines is very useful in visualizing the strength and direction of the magnetic field
__label__0 as shown in  link   the direction of magnetic field lines is defined to be the direction in which the north end of a compass needle points
__label__0 the magnetic field is traditionally called the b  field
__label__1 magnetic field lines are defined to have the direction that a small compass points when placed at a location
__label__0 a  if small compasses are used to map the magnetic field around a bar magnet  they will point in the directions shown  away from the north pole of the magnet  toward the south pole of the magnet
__label__0 meters  such as those in analog fuel gauges on a car  are another common application of magnetic torque on a current  carrying loop
__label__0 link  shows that a meter is very similar in construction to a motor
__label__0 the magnetic field of a long straight wire has more implications than you might at first suspect
__label__0 each segment of current produces a magnetic field like that of a long straight wire  and the total field of any shape current is the vector sum of the fields due to each segment
__label__1 the formal statement of the direction and magnitude of the field due to each segment is called the biot  savart law
__label__0 integral calculus is needed to sum the field for an arbitrary shape current
__label__0 rhr can be used to give the direction of the field near the loop  but mapping with compasses and the rules about field lines given in magnetic fields and magnetic field lines are needed for more detail
__label__0 there is a simple formula for the magnetic field strength at the center of a circular loop
__label__0 it is
__label__0 magnetic resonance imaging  mri  is one of the most useful and rapidly growing medical imaging tools
__label__1 it non  invasively produces two  dimensional and three  dimensional images of the body that provide important medical information with none of the hazards of x  rays
__label__0 in   some  years after oersted s discovery  the english scientist michael faraday      and the american scientist joseph henry      independently demonstrated that magnetic fields can produce currents
__label__1 the basic process of generating emfs  electromotive force  and  hence  currents with magnetic fields is known as induction  this process is also called magnetic induction to distinguish it from charging by induction  which utilizes the coulomb force
__label__0 today  currents induced by magnetic fields are essential to our technological society
__label__0 the ubiquitous generator  found in automobiles  on bicycles  in nuclear power plants  and so on  uses magnetism to generate current
__label__0 most of us have seen dramatizations in which medical personnel use a defibrillator to pass an electric current through a patient s heart to get it to beat normally
__label__0 review  link
__label__1 transformers do what their name implies  they transform voltages from one value to another  the term voltage is used rather than emf  because transformers have internal resistance
__label__0 for example  many cell phones  laptops  video games  and power tools and small appliances have a transformer built into their plug  in unit  like that in  link   that changes  v or  v ac into whatever voltage the device uses
__label__0 electricity has two hazards
__label__1 a thermal hazard occurs when there is electrical overheating
__label__0 a shock hazard occurs when electric current passes through a person
__label__0 is there a useful physical quantity related to how  effective  a given device is
__label__0 the answer is yes  and that physical quantity is called inductance
__label__0 where ll size   l    is the self  inductance of the device
__label__1 a device that exhibits significant self  inductance is called an inductor  and given the symbol in  link
__label__0 
__label__0 in fact  charges radiate whenever they are accelerated
__label__1 but while a current in a circuit needs a complete path  an antenna has a varying charge distribution forming a standing wave  driven by the ac
__label__0 the dimensions of the antenna are critical for determining the frequency of the radiated electromagnetic waves
__label__0 extremely low frequency  elf  radio waves of about  khz are used to communicate with submerged submarines
__label__0 the ability of radio waves to penetrate salt water is related to their wavelength  much like ultrasound penetrating tissue   the longer the wavelength  the farther they penetrate
__label__0 fm radio waves are also used for commercial radio transmission  but in the frequency range of  to  mhz
__label__1 fm stands for frequency modulation  another method of carrying information
__label__0 see  link
__label__0 these tv channels are called vhf  for very high frequency
__label__0 other channels called uhf  for ultra high frequency  utilize an even higher frequency range of  to  mhz
__label__1 ultraviolet means  above violet
__label__0 the electromagnetic frequencies of ultraviolet radiation  uv  extend upward from violet  the highest  frequency visible light
__label__0 ultraviolet is also produced by atomic and molecular motions and electronic transitions
__label__0 electromagnetic waves can bring energy into a system by virtue of their electric and magnetic fields
__label__0 these fields can exert forces and move charges in the system and  thus  do work on them
__label__1 since light moves in straight lines  changing directions when it interacts with materials  it is described by geometry and simple trigonometry
__label__0 this part of optics  where the ray aspect of light dominates  is therefore called geometric optics
__label__0 there are two laws that govern how light changes direction when it interacts with matter
__label__0 bundles of fibers can be used to transmit an image without a lens  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 the output of a device called an endoscope is shown in  link   b
__label__1 endoscopes are used to explore the body through various orifices or minor incisions
__label__1 ray tracing is the technique of determining or following  tracing  the paths that light rays take
__label__0 for rays passing through matter  the law of refraction is used to trace the paths
__label__0 the image is on the same side of the lens as the object and is farther away from the lens than the object
__label__1 this image  like all case  images  can not be projected and  hence  is called a virtual image
__label__0 light rays only appear to originate at a virtual image  they do not actually pass through that location in space
__label__0 link  illustrates two common vision defects
__label__1 nearsightedness  or myopia  is the inability to see distant objects clearly while close objects are clear
__label__0 the eye overconverges the nearly parallel rays from a distant object  and the rays cross in front of the retina
__label__1 the eye  brain color  sensing system can  by comparing various objects in its view  perceive the true color of an object under varying lighting conditions  an ability that is called color constancy
__label__0 we can sense that a white tablecloth  for example  is white whether it is illuminated by sunlight  fluorescent light  or candlelight
__label__0 microscopes were first developed in the early s by eyeglass makers in the netherlands and denmark
__label__0 the simplest compound microscope is constructed from two convex lenses as shown schematically in  link
__label__0 the first lens is called the objective lens  and has typical magnification values from   to
__label__0 the dutch scientist christiaan huygens      developed a useful technique for determining in detail how and where waves propagate
__label__1 starting from some known position  huygens s principle states that  every point on a wavefront is a source of wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the same speed as the wave itself
__label__0 the new wavefront is a line tangent to all of the wavelets
__label__1 by coherent  we mean waves are in phase or have a definite phase relationship
__label__1 incoherent means the waves have random phase relationships
__label__0 why did young then pass the light through a double slit
__label__0 the accepted criterion for determining the diffraction limit to resolution based on this angle was developed by lord rayleigh in the th century
__label__1 the rayleigh criterion for the diffraction limit to resolution states that two images are just resolvable when the center of the diffraction pattern of one is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other
__label__0 see  link   b
__label__0 this is not the same type of polarization as that discussed for the separation of charges
__label__0 waves having such a direction are said to be polarized
__label__0 for an em wave  we define the direction of polarization to be the direction parallel to the electric field
__label__1 the oscillations in one rope are in a vertical plane and are said to be vertically polarized
__label__1 those in the other rope are in a horizontal plane and are horizontally polarized
__label__0 if a vertical slit is placed on the first rope  the waves pass through
__label__0 einstein essentially did the theoretical aspect of this method for relativity
__label__1 with two deceptively simple postulates and a careful consideration of how measurements are made  he produced the theory of special relativity
__label__0 einstein s first postulate
__label__0 the latter is the case
__label__0 the correct formula for one  dimensional relativistic velocity addition is
__label__0 relativistic kinetic energy is
__label__0 einstein realized that there were several characteristics of the photoelectric effect that could be explained only if em radiation is itself quantized  the apparently continuous stream of energy in an em wave is actually composed of energy quanta called photons
__label__1 in his explanation of the photoelectric effect  einstein defined a quantized unit or quantum of em energy  which we now call a photon  with an energy proportional to the frequency of em radiation
__label__0 in equation form  the photon energy ise  hf  e  hf  size   e  ital
__label__1 infrared radiation  ir  has even lower photon energies than visible light and can not significantly alter atoms and molecules
__label__0 ir can be absorbed and emitted by atoms and molecules  particularly between closely spaced states
__label__0 there is also no doubt that it behaves as particles  photons with discrete energy
__label__1 we call this twofold nature the particle  wave duality  meaning that em radiation has both particle and wave properties
__label__0 this so  called duality is simply a term for properties of the photon analogous to phenomena we can observe directly  on a macroscopic scale
__label__0 see  link
__label__0 these series are named after early researchers who studied them in particular depth
__label__0 the observed hydrogen  spectrum wavelengths can be calculated using the following formula
__label__0 is the rydberg constant
__label__0 thus  we have used bohr s assumptions to derive the formula first proposed by balmer years earlier as a recipe to fit experimental data
__label__1 in the fluorescence process  an atom is excited to a level several steps above its ground state by the absorption of a relatively high  energy uv photon
__label__0 this is called atomic excitation
__label__0 once it is excited  the atom can de  excite in several ways  one of which is to re  emit a photon of the same energy as excited it  a single step back to the ground state
__label__0 these energy levels are inhibited and are slow in de  exciting because their quantum numbers differ greatly from those of available lower levels
__label__0 although these level lifetimes are short in human terms  they are many orders of magnitude longer than is typical and  thus  are said to be metastable  meaning relatively stable
__label__1 phosphorescence is the de  excitation of a metastable state
__label__0 this photon finds another atom in the metastable state and stimulates it to decay  emitting a second photon of the same wavelength and in phase with the first  and so on
__label__1 stimulated emission is the emission of electromagnetic radiation in the form of photons of a given frequency  triggered by photons of the same frequency
__label__0 for example  an excited atom  with an electron in an energy orbit higher than normal  releases a photon of a specific frequency when the electron drops back to a lower energy orbit
__label__0 the name hologram means  entire picture   from the greek holo  as in holistic   because the image is three  dimensional
__label__1 holography is the process of producing holograms and  although they are recorded on photographic film  the process is quite different from normal photography
__label__0 holography uses light interference or wave optics  whereas normal photography uses geometric optics
__label__0 detailed treatment of space quantization began to explain some complexities of atomic spectra  but certain patterns seemed to be caused by something else
__label__1 as mentioned  spectral lines are actually closely spaced doublets  a characteristic called fine structure  as shown in  link
__label__0 the doublet changes when a magnetic field is applied  implying that whatever causes the doublet interacts with a magnetic field
__label__1 a nucleus that spontaneously destroys part of its mass to emit radiation is said to decay  a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states
__label__1 a substance or object that emits nuclear radiation is said to be radioactive
__label__0 two types of experimental evidence imply that becquerel s rays originate deep in the heart  or nucleus  of an atom
__label__0 first  the radiation is found to be associated with certain elements  such as uranium
__label__0 another very common radiation detector is the geiger tube
__label__0 the clicking and buzzing sound we hear in dramatizations and documentaries  as well as in our own physics labs  is usually an audio output of events detected by a geiger counter
__label__1 solid  state radiation detectors convert ionization produced in a semiconductor  like those found in computer chips  directly into an electrical signal
__label__0 semiconductors can be constructed that do not conduct current in one particular direction
__label__0 
__label__0 all properties of a nucleus are determined by the number of protons and neutrons it has
__label__1 a specific combination of protons and neutrons is called a nuclide and is a unique nucleus
__label__0 the following notation is used to represent a particular nuclide
__label__0 unstable nuclides decay  that is  they are radioactive   eventually producing a stable nuclide after many decays
__label__1 we call the original nuclide the parent and its decay products the daughters
__label__0 some radioactive nuclides decay in a single step to a stable nucleus
__label__1 certain nuclides decay by the emission of a positive electron
__label__0 this is antielectron or positron decay  see  link
__label__1 gamma decay is the simplest form of nuclear decay  it is the emission of energetic photons by nuclei left in an excited state by some earlier process
__label__0 protons and neutrons in an excited nucleus are in higher orbitals  and they fall to lower levels by photon emission  analogous to electrons in excited atoms
__label__0 r  ntr  nt size r   n  over  t      where nn size   n    is the number of decays that occur in time t t size   t
__label__1 the si unit for activity is one decay per second and is given the name becquerel  bq  in honor of the discoverer of radioactivity
__label__0 that is   b q   decay  s
__label__0 b q   decay  s
__label__0 size
__label__0 activity rr size   r    is often expressed in other units  such as decays per minute or decays per year
__label__0 experiments have shown that the more energetic the   size       decay of a particular nuclide is  the shorter is its half  life
__label__0 tunneling explains this in the following manner  for the decay to be more energetic  the nucleons must have more energy in the nucleus and should be able to ascend a little closer to the rim
__label__0 the barrier is therefore not as thick for more energetic decay  and the exponential decrease of the wave function inside the barrier is not as great
__label__0 mtcmtc
__label__0 technetium   m can be attached to many compounds to allow the imaging of the skeleton  heart  lungs  kidneys  etc
__label__0 link  shows one of the simpler methods of imaging the concentration of nuclear activity  employing a device called an anger camera or gamma camera
__label__0 a piece of lead with holes bored through it collimates  size       rays emerging from the patient  allowing detectors to receive   size       rays from specific directions only
__label__0 concentrated damage is more difficult for biological organisms to repair than damage that is spread out  so short  range particles have greater biological effects
__label__0 the relative biological effectiveness  rbe  or quality factor  qf  is given in  link  for several types of ionizing radiation  the effect of the radiation is directly proportional to the rbe
__label__0 a dose unit more closely related to effects in biological tissue is called the roentgen equivalent man or rem and is defined to be the dose in rads multiplied by the relative biological effectiveness
__label__0 rem  rad  rbe rem  rad  rbe
__label__0 certain researchers even claim that low doses are beneficial
__label__1 hormesis is a term used to describe generally favorable biological responses to low exposures of toxins or radiation
__label__0 such low levels may help certain repair mechanisms to develop or enable cells to adapt to the effects of the low exposures
__label__0 the central problem in radiotherapy is to make the dose for cancer cells as high as possible while limiting the dose for normal cells
__label__1 the ratio of abnormal cells killed to normal cells killed is called the therapeutic ratio  and all radiotherapy techniques are designed to enhance this ratio
__label__0 radiation can be concentrated in cancerous tissue by a number of techniques
__label__0 ionization produces a random assortment of broken molecules and ions  some with unstable oxygen or hydrogen  containing molecules known as free radicals
__label__0 these undergo rapid chemical reactions  producing perhaps four or five thousand different compounds called radiolytic products  some of which make cell function impossible by breaking cell membranes  fracturing dna  and so on
__label__0 how safe is the food afterward
__label__0 this goal  which must be reached before commercial plants can be a reality  has not been achieved
__label__1 another milestone  called break  even  occurs when the fusion power produced equals the heating power input
__label__0 break  even has nearly been reached and gives hope that ignition and commercial plants may become a reality in a few decades
__label__0 two techniques have shown considerable promise
__label__1 nuclear fission is a reaction in which a nucleus is split  or fissured
__label__0 controlled fission is a reality  whereas controlled fusion is a hope for the future
__label__0 we can enhance the number of fissions produced by neutrons by having a large amount of fissionable material
__label__1 the minimum amount necessary for self  sustained fission of a given nuclide is called its critical mass
__label__0 some nuclides  such as
__label__0 
__label__1 reactors designed specifically to make plutonium are called breeder reactors
__label__1 the single surviving species of the gingkophytes group is the gingko biloba   link
__label__1 its fan  shaped leaves  unique among seed plants because they feature a dichotomous venation pattern  turn yellow in autumn and fall from the tree
__label__0 for example  the corolla in lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical
__label__1 petals  collectively the corolla  are located inside the whorl of sepals and often display vivid colors to attract pollinators
__label__0 flowers pollinated by wind are usually small  feathery  and visually inconspicuous
__label__0 flower structure is very diverse  and carpels may be singular  multiple  or fused
__label__1 multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil
__label__0 the megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel
__label__1 the male reproductive organs  the stamens  collectively called the androecium   surround the central carpel
__label__1 stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac  like structure called the anther
__label__0 the filament supports the anther  where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains
__label__0 vascular tissue forms a ring in the stem  in monocots  vascular tissue is scattered in the stem
__label__0 eudicots can be herbaceous  like grasses   or produce woody tissues
__label__1 most eudicots produce pollen that is trisulcate or triporate  with three furrows or pores
__label__0 it is possible  for example  to determine the type of pollinator favored by a plant just from the flower s characteristics
__label__1 many bird or insect  pollinated flowers secrete nectar  which is a sugary liquid
__label__0 they also produce both fertile pollen  for reproduction  and sterile pollen rich in nutrients for birds and insects
__label__0 heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations  as opposed to the seeds used for large  scale agricultural production
__label__1 barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences  taken from a well  characterized portion of the genome  are used to identify a species through dna analysis
__label__1 male gametes reach female gametophyte and the egg cell gamete though a pollen tube  an extension of a cell within the pollen grain
__label__0 the sperm of modern gymnosperms lack flagella  but in cycads and the gingko  the sperm still possess flagella that allow them to swim down the pollen tube to the female gamete  however  they are enclosed in a pollen grain
__label__0 most animals reproduce sexually  and the offspring pass through a series of developmental stages that establish a determined and fixed body plan
__label__1 the body plan refers to the morphology of an animal  determined by developmental cues
__label__0 all animals are heterotrophs that derive energy from food
__label__0 the  a  black bear is an omnivore  eating both plants and animals
__label__1 next  the blastula undergoes further cell division and cellular rearrangement during a process called gastrulation
__label__1 this leads to the formation of the next developmental stage  the gastrula  in which the future digestive cavity is formed
__label__0 different cell layers  called germ layers  are formed during gastrulation
__label__1 these genes that determine animal structure are called  homeotic genes   and they contain dna sequences called homeoboxes
__label__1 the animal genes containing homeobox sequences are specifically referred to as hox genes
__label__0 this family of genes is responsible for determining the general body plan  such as the number of body segments of an animal  the number and placement of appendages  and animal head  tail directionality
__label__1 the animals that display radial symmetry develop two germ layers  an inner layer  endoderm  and an outer layer  ectoderm
__label__0 these animals are called diploblasts
__label__0 diploblasts have a non  living layer between the endoderm and ectoderm
__label__0 bilaterally symmetrical  triploblastic eucoelomates can be further divided into two groups based on differences in their early embryonic development
__label__0 protostomes include arthropods  mollusks  and annelids
__label__0 deuterostomes include more complex animals such as chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms
__label__0 recent evidence has challenged this view of the development of the blastopore of protostomes  however  and the theory remains under debate  another distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the method of coelom formation  beginning from the gastrula stage
__label__1 the coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process called schizocoely  meaning that during development  a solid mass of the mesoderm splits apart and forms the hollow opening of the coelom
__label__0 deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process called enterocoely
__label__0 this is due to the oblique angle of the cleavage
__label__0 deuterostomes undergo radial cleavage  where the cleavage axes are either parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis  resulting in the alignment of the cells between the two poles
__label__1 the time before the cambrian period is known as the ediacaran period  from about  million years ago to  million years ago   the final period of the late proterozoic neoproterozoic era   link
__label__1 it is believed that early animal life  termed ediacaran biota  evolved from protists at this time
__label__0 on the other hand  cataclysmic events  such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes that obliterate life  can result in devastating losses of diversity
__label__0 such periods of mass extinction   link   have occurred repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life  erasing some genetic lines while creating room for others to evolve into the empty niches left behind
__label__0 the end of the permian period  and the paleozoic era  was marked by the largest mass extinction event in earth s history  a loss of roughly  percent of the extant species at that time
__label__0 morphology of sponges
__label__1 the morphology of the simplest sponges takes the shape of a cylinder with a large central cavity  the spongocoel  occupying the inside of the cylinder
__label__0 water can enter into the spongocoel from numerous pores in the body wall
__label__1 the second crucial cells in sponges are called amoebocytes  or archaeocytes   named for the fact that they move throughout the mesohyl in an amoeba  like fashion
__label__0 amoebocytes have a variety of functions  delivering nutrients from choanocytes to other cells within the sponge  giving rise to eggs for sexual reproduction  which remain in the mesohyl   delivering phagocytized sperm from choanocytes to eggs  and differentiating into more  specific cell types
__label__1 phylum cnidaria includes animals that show radial or biradial symmetry and are diploblastic  that is  they develop from two embryonic layers
__label__1 phylum cnidaria includes animals that show radial or biradial symmetry and are diploblastic  that is  they develop from two embryonic layers
__label__0 nearly all  about  percent  cnidarians are marine species
__label__0 click here to follow the life cycle of the obelia
__label__1 all cnidarians show the presence of two membrane layers in the body that are derived from the endoderm and ectoderm of the embryo
__label__0 the outer layer  from ectoderm  is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal  whereas the inner layer  from endoderm  is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive cavity
__label__0 between these two membrane layers is a non  living  jelly  like mesoglea connective layer
__label__0 the cnidarians perform extracellular digestion in which the food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity  enzymes are secreted into the cavity  and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients
__label__1 the gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus  which is termed an incomplete digestive system
__label__0 cnidarian cells exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion between cells in the epidermis with water in the environment  and between cells in the gastrodermis with water in the gastrovascular cavity
__label__0 this is called protostomy or  first mouth
__label__1 in protostomy  solid groups of cells split from the endoderm or inner germ layer to form a central mesodermal layer of cells
__label__1 this layer multiplies into a band and then splits internally to form the coelom  this protostomic coelom is hence termed schizocoelom
__label__1 the nemertea are colloquially known as ribbon worms
__label__0 most species of phylum nemertea are marine  predominantly benthic or bottom dwellers  with an estimated  species known
__label__0 however  nemertini have been recorded in freshwater and terrestrial habitats as well
__label__0 the zygote then develops into a planuliform larva
__label__0 in some nemertine species  a pilidium larva may develop inside the young worm  from a series of imaginal discs
__label__1 this larval form  characteristically shaped like a deerstalker cap  devours tissues from the young worm for survival before metamorphosing into the adult  like morphology
__label__1 additionally  a tongue  like organ called a radula  which bears chitinous tooth  like ornamentation  is present in many species  and serves to shred or scrape food

__label__1 the name  arthropoda  means  jointed legs   in the greek   arthros  means  joint  and  podos  means  leg    it aptly describes the enormous number of invertebrates included in this phylum
__label__0 arthropoda dominate the animal kingdom with an estimated  percent of known species included in this phylum and many arthropods yet undocumented
__label__0 the principal characteristics of all the animals in this phylum are functional segmentation of the body and presence of jointed appendages
__label__0 unlike that of the hexapoda  the head and thorax of most crustaceans is fused to form a cephalothorax   link    which is covered by a plate called the carapace  thus producing a body structure of two tagma
__label__0 crustaceans have a chitinous exoskeleton that is shed by molting whenever the animal increases in size
__label__0 larval stages  nauplius and zoea  are seen in the early development of crustaceans
__label__0 a cypris larva is also seen in the early development of barnacles   link

__label__1 in some species  like sea spiders  an additional pair of appendages  called ovigers  is present between the chelicerae and pedipalps
__label__1 phylum echinodermataechinodermata are so named owing to their spiny skin  from the greek  echinos  meaning  spiny  and  dermos  meaning  skin    and this phylum is a collection of about  described living species
__label__0 echinodermata are exclusively marine organisms
__label__0 sea stars   link    sea cucumbers  sea urchins  sand dollars  and brittle stars are all examples of echinoderms
__label__0 phylum chordataanimals in the phylum chordata share four key features that appear at some stage of their development  a notochord  a dorsal hollow nerve cord  pharyngeal slits  and a post  anal tail
__label__0 in some groups  some of these traits are present only during embryonic development
__label__0 the dorsal hollow nerve cord derives from ectoderm that rolls into a hollow tube during development
__label__0 in chordates  it is located dorsal to the notochord
__label__1 the post  anal tail is a posterior elongation of the body  extending beyond the anus
__label__0 the tail contains skeletal elements and muscles  which provide a source of locomotion in aquatic species  such as fishes
__label__1 extant members of cephalochordata are the lancelets  named for their blade  like shape
__label__0 lancelets are only a few centimeters long and are usually found buried in sand at the bottom of warm temperate and tropical seas
__label__0 vertebrates are members of the clade vertebrata
__label__0 vertebrates display the four characteristic features of the chordates  however  members of this group also share derived characteristics that distinguish them from invertebrate chordates
__label__0 the clade myxini includes at least  species of hagfishes
__label__1 hagfishes are eel  like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on dead invertebrates  other fishes  and marine mammals   link
__label__0 the clade petromyzontidae includes approximately    or more species of lampreys
__label__1 lampreys are similar to hagfishes in size and shape  however  lampreys possess some vertebral elements
__label__0 lampreys lack paired appendages and bone  as do the hagfishes
__label__0 sharks have well  developed sense organs that aid them in locating prey  including a keen sense of smell and electroreception  with the latter perhaps the most sensitive of any animal
__label__1 organs called ampullae of lorenzini allow sharks to detect the electromagnetic fields that are produced by all living things  including their prey
__label__0 electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals
__label__0 water is drawn over gills that are located in chambers covered and ventilated by a protective  muscular flap called the operculum
__label__1 many bony fishes also have a swim bladder  a gas  filled organ that helps to control the buoyancy of the fish
__label__1 bony fishes are further divided into two extant clades  actinopterygii  ray  finned fishes  and sarcopterygii  lobe  finned fishes
__label__1 an estimated  species comprise caecilians  a group of amphibians that belong to the order apoda
__label__0 although they are vertebrates  a complete lack of limbs leads to their resemblance to earthworms in appearance
__label__0 the amnion protects the embryo from mechanical shock and supports hydration
__label__0 the allantois stores nitrogenous wastes produced by the embryo and also facilitates respiration
__label__0 in mammals  membranes that are homologous to the extra  embryonic membranes in eggs are present in the placenta
__label__0 the key differences between the synapsids  anapsids  and diapsids are the structures of the skull and the number of temporal fenestrae behind each eye   link
__label__1 temporal fenestrae are post  orbital openings in the skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen
__label__0 anapsids have no temporal fenestrae  synapsids have one  and diapsids have two
__label__1 mammalian integument  or skin  includes secretory glands with various functions
__label__1 sebaceous glands produce a lipid mixture called sebum that is secreted onto the hair and skin for water resistance and lubrication
__label__0 sebaceous glands are located over most of the body
__label__1 apocrine glands  or scent glands  secrete substances that are used for chemical communication  such as in skunks
__label__0 mammary glands produce milk that is used to feed newborns
__label__0 while male monotremes and eutherians possess mammary glands  male marsupials do not
__label__1 most mammals have heterodont teeth  meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth rather than just one type and shape of tooth
__label__1 most mammals are diphyodonts  meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime  deciduous or  baby  teeth  and permanent teeth
__label__1 other vertebrates are polyphyodonts  that is  their teeth are replaced throughout their entire life
__label__0 marsupials are found primarily in australia  though the opossum is found in north america
__label__0 australian marsupials include the kangaroo  koala  bandicoot  tasmanian devil   link    and several other species
__label__1 the feathers on a wing are flexible  so the collective feathers move and separate as air moves through them  reducing the drag on the wing
__label__1 flight feathers are asymmetrical  which affects airflow over them and provides some of the lifting and thrusting force required for flight   link
__label__0 two types of flight feathers are found on the wings  primary feathers and secondary feathers
__label__1 secondary feathers are located closer to the body  attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift
__label__1 contour feathers are the feathers found on the body  and they help reduce drag produced by wind resistance during flight
__label__0 they create a smooth  aerodynamic surface so that air moves smoothly over the bird s body  allowing for efficient flight
__label__0 rather  saurischia diverged into two groups  one included the long  necked herbivorous dinosaurs  such as apatosaurus
__label__1 the second group  bipedal predators called theropods  includes birds
__label__0 this course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds  specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones  as well as the presence of the wishbone  formed by the fusing of the clavicles  one important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is archaeopteryx  which is from the jurassic period   link
__label__0 after the extinction of enantiornithes  modern birds became the dominant bird  with a large radiation occurring during the cenozoic era
__label__1 referred to as neornithes   new birds    modern birds are now classified into two groups  the paleognathae   old jaw   or ratites  a group of flightless birds including ostriches  emus  rheas  and kiwis  and the neognathae   new jaw    which includes all other birds
__label__0 these proto  primates remain largely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes available
__label__1 the oldest known primate  like mammals with a relatively robust fossil record is plesiadapis  although some researchers do not agree that plesiadapis was a proto  primate
__label__0 fossils of this primate have been dated to approximately  million years ago
__label__0 plant tissue systems fall into one of two general types  meristematic tissue  and permanent  or non  meristematic  tissue
__label__1 cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems  which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth
__label__0 meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated  and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant
__label__0 meristematic tissues consist of three types  based on their location in the plant
__label__1 apical meristems contain meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots  which enable a plant to extend in length
__label__1 lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant
__label__0 they differentiate into three main types  dermal  vascular  and ground tissue
__label__1 dermal tissue covers and protects the plant  and vascular tissue transports water  minerals  and sugars to different parts of the plant
__label__1 ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis  provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue  and helps to store water and sugars
__label__0 plant stems  whether above or below ground  are characterized by the presence of nodes and internodes   link
__label__1 nodes are points of attachment for leaves  aerial roots  and flowers
__label__1 the stem region between two nodes is called an internode
__label__1 an axillary bud is usually found in the axil  the area between the base of a leaf and the stem  where it can give rise to a branch or a flower
__label__0 the apex  tip  of the shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud
__label__1 sclerenchyma cells also provide support to the plant  but unlike collenchyma cells  many of them are dead at maturity
__label__0 there are two types of sclerenchyma cells  fibers and sclereids
__label__0 the latter two types conduct water and are dead at maturity
__label__1 tracheids are xylem cells with thick secondary cell walls that are lignified
__label__0 water moves from one tracheid to another through regions on the side walls known as pits  where secondary walls are absent
__label__0 although still alive at maturity  the nucleus and other cell components of the sieve  tube cells have disintegrated
__label__1 companion cells are found alongside the sieve  tube cells  providing them with metabolic support
__label__0 the companion cells contain more ribosomes and mitochondria than the sieve  tube cells  which lack some cellular organelles
__label__0 some plant species have modified stems that are especially suited to a particular habitat and environment   link
__label__1 a rhizome is a modified stem that grows horizontally underground and has nodes and internodes
__label__0 vertical shoots may arise from the buds on the rhizome of some plants  such as ginger and ferns
__label__1 stolons are stems that run almost parallel to the ground  or just below the surface  and can give rise to new plants at the nodes
__label__1 runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals  strawberries are an example
__label__1 tubers are modified stems that may store starch  as seen in the potato  solanum sp
__label__0 
__label__0 some aerial modifications of stems are tendrils and thorns   link
__label__1 tendrils are slender  twining strands that enable a plant  like a vine or pumpkin  to seek support by climbing on other surfaces
__label__1 thorns are modified branches appearing as sharp outgrowths that protect the plant  common examples include roses  osage orange and devil s walking stick
__label__0 dicots have a tap root system  while monocots have a fibrous root system
__label__1 a tap root system has a main root that grows down vertically  and from which many smaller lateral roots arise
__label__0 dandelions are a good example  their tap roots usually break off when trying to pull these weeds  and they can regrow another shoot from the remaining root
__label__0 the epidermis provides protection and helps in absorption
__label__1 root hairs  which are extensions of root epidermal cells  increase the surface area of the root  greatly contributing to the absorption of water and minerals
__label__0 a waxy substance called suberin is present on the walls of the endodermal cells
__label__1 this waxy region  known as the casparian strip  forces water and solutes to cross the plasma membranes of endodermal cells instead of slipping between the cells
__label__0 this ensures that only materials required by the root pass through the endodermis  while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded
__label__1 each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina  which is also the widest part of the leaf
__label__0 some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole
__label__1 leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves
__label__0 within each leaf  the vascular tissue forms veins
__label__1 the arrangement of veins in a leaf is called the venation pattern
__label__0 monocots and dicots differ in their patterns of venation   link
__label__0 leaves may be simple or compound   link
__label__1 in a simple leaf  the blade is either completely undivided  as in the banana leaf  or it has lobes  but the separation does not reach the midrib  as in the maple leaf
__label__1 in a compound leaf  the leaf blade is completely divided  forming leaflets  as in the locust tree
__label__0 common name  umbrella plant
__label__0 pinnately compound leaves take their name from their feather  like appearance  the leaflets are arranged along the midrib  as in rose leaves  rosa sp    or the leaves of hickory  pecan  ash  or walnut trees
__label__1 in practical terms  therefore  water potential is the difference in potential energy between a given water sample and pure water  at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature
__label__0 water potential is denoted by the greek letter   psi  and is expressed in units of pressure  pressure is a form of energy  called megapascals  mpa
__label__0 the potential of pure water  wpure ho  is  by convenience of definition  designated a value of zero  even though pure water contains plenty of potential energy  that energy is ignored
__label__0 leaves are covered by a waxy cuticle on the outer surface that prevents the loss of water
__label__0 regulation of transpiration  therefore  is achieved primarily through the opening and closing of stomata on the leaf surface
__label__1 the aptly  named phototropins are protein  based receptors responsible for mediating the phototropic response
__label__0 like all plant photoreceptors  phototropins consist of a protein portion and a light  absorbing portion  called the chromophore
__label__1 amyloplasts  also known as statoliths  are specialized plastids that contain starch granules and settle downward in response to gravity
__label__0 amyloplasts are found in shoots and in specialized cells of the root cap
__label__0 the effect of cytokinins was first reported when it was found that adding the liquid endosperm of coconuts to developing plant embryos in culture stimulated their growth
__label__1 the stimulating growth factor was found to be cytokinin  a hormone that promotes cytokinesis  cell division
__label__1 the stimulating growth factor was found to be cytokinin  a hormone that promotes cytokinesis  cell division
__label__0 almost  naturally occurring or synthetic cytokinins are known to date
__label__0 ethylene is associated with fruit ripening  flower wilting  and leaf fall
__label__0 ethylene is unusual because it is a volatile gas  ch
__label__0 they act locally at the site of injury  and can also be transported to other tissues
__label__1 strigolactones promote seed germination in some species and inhibit lateral apical development in the absence of auxins
__label__1 strigolactones also play a role in the establishment of mycorrhizae  a mutualistic association of plant roots and fungi
__label__0 glands on the leaf surface secrete enzymes that slowly digest the insect
__label__0 the released nutrients are absorbed by the leaves  which reopen for the next meal
__label__1 thigmomorphogenesis is a slow developmental change in the shape of a plant subjected to continuous mechanical stress
__label__0 when trees bend in the wind  for example  growth is usually stunted and the trunk thickens
__label__0 plants require only light  water and about  elements to support all their biochemical needs  these  elements are called essential nutrients   link
__label__0 for an element to be regarded as essential  three criteria are required    a plant can not complete its life cycle without the element    no other element can perform the function of the element  and   the element is directly involved in plant nutrition
__label__0 plants obtain inorganic elements from the soil  which serves as a natural medium for land plants
__label__1 soil is the outer loose layer that covers the surface of earth
__label__0 the adrenal glands are associated with the kidneys  one gland is located on top of each kidney as illustrated in  link
__label__1 the adrenal glands consist of an outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla
__label__1 the pancreas  illustrated in  link   is an elongated organ that is located between the stomach and the proximal portion of the small intestine
__label__1 it contains both exocrine cells that excrete digestive enzymes and endocrine cells that release hormones
__label__0 the heart possesses endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that are specialized cardiac muscle cells
__label__0 these cells release the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide  anp  in response to increased blood volume
__label__0 high blood volume causes the cells to be stretched  resulting in hormone release
__label__0 epo has been used by athletes to improve performance  as greater oxygen delivery to muscle cells allows for greater endurance
__label__0 because red blood cells increase the viscosity of blood  artificially high levels of epo can cause severe health risks
__label__1 the thymus is found behind the sternum  it is most prominent in infants  becoming smaller in size through adulthood
__label__0 the thymus produces hormones referred to as thymosins  which contribute to the development of the immune response
__label__1 the hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known as antidiuretic hormone  adh   which is transported to and released from the posterior pituitary gland
__label__0 the principal action of adh is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the kidneys
__label__1 in contrast to adh  which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain proper water balance  aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing na reabsorption and k secretion from extracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules
__label__1 because it is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and affects the concentrations of minerals na and k  aldosterone is referred to as a mineralocorticoid  a corticosteroid that affects ion and water balance
__label__0 aldosterone release is stimulated by a decrease in blood sodium levels  blood volume  or blood pressure  or an increase in blood potassium levels
__label__1 during puberty in both males and females  the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin  releasing hormone  gnrh   which stimulates the production and release of follicle  stimulating hormone  fsh  and luteinizing hormone  lh  from the anterior pituitary gland
__label__1 these hormones regulate the gonads  testes in males and ovaries in females  and therefore are called gonadotropins
__label__0 in both males and females  fsh stimulates gamete production and lh stimulates production of hormones by the gonads
__label__1 prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands following childbirth
__label__0 prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin  releasing hormone  prh  and prolactin  inhibiting hormone  pih   which is now known to be dopamine
__label__0 prh stimulates the release of prolactin and pih inhibits it  the posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin  which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth
__label__1 impaired insulin function can lead to a condition called diabetes mellitus  the main symptoms of which are illustrated in  link
__label__0 this can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas  or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin
__label__1 the basal metabolic rate  which is the amount of calories required by the body at rest  is determined by two hormones produced by the thyroid gland  thyroxine  also known as tetraiodothyronine or t  and triiodothyronine  also known as t
__label__0 these hormones affect nearly every cell in the body except for the adult brain  uterus  testes  blood cells  and spleen
__label__0 inadequate iodine intake  which occurs in many developing countries  results in an inability to synthesize t and t hormones
__label__1 the thyroid gland enlarges in a condition called goiter  which is caused by overproduction of tsh without the formation of thyroid hormone
__label__0 thyroglobulin is contained in a fluid called colloid  and tsh stimulation results in higher levels of colloid accumulation in the thyroid
__label__0 blood calcium levels are regulated by parathyroid hormone  pth   which is produced by the parathyroid glands  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 pth is released in response to low blood ca  levels
__label__1 this results in a switch by most tissues from utilizing glucose as an energy source to utilizing fatty acids
__label__0 this process is called a glucose  sparing effect
__label__0 in another direct mechanism  gh stimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver  the glycogen is then released into the blood as glucose
__label__0 a balanced production of growth hormone is critical for proper development
__label__1 underproduction of gh in adults does not appear to cause any abnormalities  but in children it can result in pituitary dwarfism  in which growth is reduced
__label__0 pituitary dwarfism is characterized by symmetric body formation
__label__0 the sympathetic nervous system regulates the stress response via the hypothalamus
__label__1 stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla  which mediates short  term stress responses  via nerve impulses  and the adrenal cortex  which mediates long  term stress responses  via the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone  acth   which is produced by the anterior pituitary
__label__0 short  term stress responsewhen presented with a stressful situation  the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst of energy
__label__0 the hormones epinephrine  also known as adrenaline  and norepinephrine  also known as noradrenaline  are released by the adrenal medulla
__label__0 they change enzyme concentrations in the cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism
__label__0 there are two main corticosteroids  glucocorticoids such as cortisol  and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone
__label__0 these hormones target the breakdown of fat into fatty acids in the adipose tissue
__label__0 this can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck  and excessive glucose in the blood
__label__1 hyposecretion of the corticosteroids can cause addison s disease  which may result in bronzing of the skin  hypoglycemia  and low electrolyte levels in the blood
__label__0 the bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain
__label__0 the skull consists of  bones  which are divided into two categories  cranial bones and facial bones
__label__0 the auditory ossicles consist of three bones each  the malleus  incus  and stapes
__label__1 these are the smallest bones in the body and are unique to mammals
__label__0 fourteen facial bones form the face  provide cavities for the sense organs  eyes  mouth  and nose   protect the entrances to the digestive and respiratory tracts  and serve as attachment points for facial muscles
__label__0 the  facial bones are the nasal bones  the maxillary bones  zygomatic bones  palatine  vomer  lacrimal bones  the inferior nasal conchae  and the mandible
__label__1 intervertebral discs composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra to the sacrum
__label__0 each disc is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the spine and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks from movements such as walking and running
__label__0 it is formed from three bones that fuse in the adult
__label__1 the ribs are  pairs of long  curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and curve toward the front of the body  forming the ribcage
__label__1 costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of the ribs to the sternum  with the exception of rib pairs  and   which are free  floating ribs
__label__1 the clavicles are s  shaped bones that position the arms on the body
__label__0 the clavicles lie horizontally across the front of the thorax  chest  just above the first rib
__label__1 an articulation is any place at which two bones are joined
__label__1 the humerus is the largest and longest bone of the upper limb and the only bone of the arm
__label__0 it articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow
__label__1 the radius is located along the lateral  thumb  side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow
__label__1 the ulna is located on the medial aspect  pinky  finger side  of the forearm
__label__0 it is longer than the radius
__label__0 the pelvic girdle is further strengthened by two large hip bones
__label__1 in adults  the hip bones  or coxal bones  are formed by the fusion of three pairs of bones  the ilium  ischium  and pubis
__label__0 the pelvis joins together in the anterior of the body at a joint called the pubic symphysis and with the bones of the sacrum at the posterior of the body
__label__1 at the distal end  the femur  tibia  and patella form the knee joint
__label__1 the patella  or kneecap  is a triangular bone that lies anterior to the knee joint
__label__1 the patella is embedded in the tendon of the femoral extensors  quadriceps
__label__1 the tarsals are the seven bones of the ankle
__label__1 the ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the fibula to the foot
__label__0 the amount of movement in these types of joints is determined by the length of the connective tissue fibers
__label__1 gomphoses occur between teeth and their sockets  the term refers to the way the tooth fits into the socket like a peg   link
__label__0 the tooth is connected to the socket by a connective tissue referred to as the periodontal ligament
__label__1 synchondroses are found in the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children
__label__0 in symphyses  hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage
__label__1 symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae
__label__0 this includes sutures  gomphoses  and synchondroses
__label__1 amphiarthroses are joints that allow slight movement  including syndesmoses and symphyses
__label__1 diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of the joint  as in synovial joints
__label__1 angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes
__label__0 there are several different types of angular movements  including flexion  extension  hyperextension  abduction  adduction  and circumduction
__label__1 movement of the limbs inward after abduction is an example of adduction
__label__1 circumduction is the movement of a limb in a circular motion  as in moving the arm in a circular motion
__label__1 depression is the opposite of elevation  movement downward of a bone  such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position
__label__1 dorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee
__label__1 plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted  such as when standing on the toes
__label__1 supination is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward
__label__1 pronation is the opposite movement  in which the palm faces backward
__label__1 opposition is the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand  making it possible to grasp and hold objects
__label__1 in hinge joints  the slightly rounded end of one bone fits into the slightly hollow end of the other bone
__label__0 in this way  one bone moves while the other remains stationary  like the hinge of a door
__label__1 saddle joints are so named because the ends of each bone resemble a saddle  with concave and convex portions that fit together
__label__0 saddle joints allow angular movements similar to condyloid joints but with a greater range of motion
__label__0 the striations are caused by the regular arrangement of contractile proteins  actin and myosin
__label__1 actin is a globular contractile protein that interacts with myosin for muscle contraction
__label__0 skeletal muscle also has multiple nuclei present in a single cell
__label__0 these cells are incredibly large  with diameters of up to  m and lengths of up to  cm
__label__1 the plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber is called the sarcolemma
__label__0 the sarcolemma is the site of action potential conduction  which triggers muscle contraction
__label__1 myofibrils are composed of smaller structures called myofilaments
__label__0 there are two main types of filaments  thick filaments and thin filaments  each has different compositions and locations
__label__0 to keep actin from binding to the active site on myosin  regulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites
__label__1 tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules  preventing cross  bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input
__label__0 troponin binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule  it also binds calcium ions
__label__0 ach is broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase  ache  into acetyl and choline
__label__0 ache resides in the synaptic cleft  breaking down ach so that it does not remain bound to ach receptors  which would cause unwanted extended muscle contraction   link
__label__1 long bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends
__label__0 the diaphysis  or central shaft  contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity
__label__1 short bones  or cuboidal bones  are bones that are the same width and length  giving them a cube  like shape
__label__0 for example  the bones of the wrist  carpals  and ankle  tarsals  are short bones   link
__label__1 sesamoid bones are small  flat bones and are shaped similarly to a sesame seed
__label__0 the patellae are sesamoid bones   link
__label__0 compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or haversian systems
__label__1 osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi  which transport blood
__label__1 osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi  which transport blood
__label__0 they are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone
__label__0 whereas compact bone tissue forms the outer layer of all bones  spongy bone or cancellous bone forms the inner layer of all bones
__label__1 spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue
__label__0 osteoblasts become trapped in these secretions and differentiate into less active osteocytes
__label__1 osteoclasts are large bone cells with up to  nuclei
__label__0 they remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal enzymes and acids that dissolve the bony matrix
__label__1 ossification  or osteogenesis  is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts
__label__0 ossification is distinct from the process of calcification  whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones  it can also occur in other tissues
__label__0 secondary ossification centers form in the epiphyses as blood vessels and osteoblasts enter these areas and convert hyaline cartilage into spongy bone
__label__1 until adolescence  hyaline cartilage persists at the epiphyseal plate  growth plate   which is the region between the diaphysis and epiphysis that is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones   link
__label__0 in mammals  pulmonary ventilation occurs via inhalation  breathing
__label__1 during inhalation  air enters the body through the nasal cavity located just inside the nose   link
__label__0 as air passes through the nasal cavity  the air is warmed to body temperature and humidified
__label__0 in the lungs  air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages  or bronchi
__label__0 air enters the lungs through the two primary  main  bronchi  singular  bronchus
__label__0 bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control muscle contraction  parasympathetic  or relaxation  sympathetic  in the bronchi and bronchioles  depending on the nervous system s cues
__label__1 in humans  bronchioles with a diameter smaller than  mm are the respiratory bronchioles
__label__0 they lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape
__label__0 in the acinar region  the alveolar ducts are attached to the end of each bronchiole
__label__1 at the end of each duct are approximately  alveolar sacs  each containing  to  alveoli that are  to  microns in diameter
__label__0 gas exchange occurs only in alveoli
__label__1 partial pressure is a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases
__label__0 the total pressure exerted by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture
__label__0 on average  this volume is around one  half liter  which is a little less than the capacity of a   ounce drink bottle
__label__1 the expiratory reserve volume  erv  is the additional amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation
__label__0 it is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal
__label__0 capacities are measurements of two or more volumes
__label__1 the vital capacity  vc  measures the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled or exhaled during a respiratory cycle
__label__0 it is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume  tidal volume  and inspiratory reserve volume
__label__1 the frc measures the amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation
__label__1 lastly  the total lung capacity  tlc  is a measurement of the total amount of air that the lung can hold
__label__0 it is the sum of the residual volume  expiratory reserve volume  tidal volume  and inspiratory reserve volume
__label__1 in addition  the forced vital capacity  fvc   which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled  is measured
__label__0 the ratio of these values  fev  fvc ratio  is used to diagnose lung diseases including asthma  emphysema  and fibrosis
__label__0 if the fev  fvc ratio is high  the lungs are not compliant  meaning they are stiff and unable to bend properly   and the patient most likely has lung fibrosis
__label__0 the chest wall expands out and away from the lungs
__label__0 the lungs are elastic  therefore  when air fills the lungs  the elastic recoil within the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs
__label__0 these outward and inward forces compete to inflate and deflate the lung with every breath
__label__1 the space between these layers  the intrapleural space  contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax
__label__1 pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become inflamed  it is painful because the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung
__label__0 there are two types of work conducted during respiration  flow  resistive and elastic work
__label__1 flow  resistive refers to the work of the alveoli and tissues in the lung  whereas elastic work refers to the work of the intercostal muscles  chest wall  and diaphragm
__label__0 increasing the respiration rate increases the flow  resistive work of the airways and decreases the elastic work of the muscles
__label__0 pulmonary diseases reduce the rate of gas exchange into and out of the lungs
__label__1 two main causes of decreased gas exchange are compliance  how elastic the lung is  and resistance  how much obstruction exists in the airways
__label__0 a change in either can dramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide
__label__0 obstructive diseases and conditions include emphysema  asthma  and pulmonary edema
__label__1 in emphysema  which mostly arises from smoking tobacco  the walls of the alveoli are destroyed  decreasing the surface area for gas exchange
__label__0 there are two types of v  q mismatch
__label__1 both produce dead space  regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue
__label__0 dead spaces can severely impact breathing  because they reduce the surface area available for gas diffusion
__label__1 hemoglobinhemoglobin  or hb  is a protein molecule found in red blood cells  erythrocytes  made of four subunits  two alpha subunits and two beta subunits   link
__label__0 each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen molecule  allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules
__label__0 molecules with more oxygen bound to the heme groups are brighter red
__label__0 increased temperature  such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle  causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced  diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygen  carrying capacity
__label__1 in sickle cell anemia  the shape of the red blood cell is crescent  shaped  elongated  and stiffened  reducing its ability to deliver oxygen   link
__label__0 in this form  red blood cells can not pass through the capillaries
__label__0 third  the majority of carbon dioxide molecules   percent  are carried as part of the bicarbonate buffer system
__label__1 in this system  carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells
__label__0 in all vertebrate organisms  as well as some invertebrates  this is a closed  loop system  in which the blood is not free in a cavity
__label__1 in a closed circulatory system  blood is contained inside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally from the heart around the systemic circulatory route  then returns to the heart again  as illustrated in  link  a
__label__0 as opposed to a closed system  arthropods  including insects  crustaceans  and most mollusks  have an open circulatory system  as illustrated in  link  b
__label__0 as illustrated in  linka fish have a single circuit for blood flow and a two  chambered heart that has only a single atrium and a single ventricle
__label__1 the atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re  oxygenated  this is called gill circulation
__label__0 the blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium  this is called systemic circulation
__label__1 the result is a limit in the amount of oxygen that can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body  reducing the overall metabolic capacity of fish  in amphibians  reptiles  birds  and mammals  blood flow is directed in two circuits  one through the lungs and back to the heart  which is called pulmonary circulation  and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain  systemic circulation
__label__0 in amphibians  gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation
__label__0 the blood is more than the proteins  though
__label__1 blood is actually a term used to describe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includes plasma  the liquid portion  which contains water  proteins  salts  lipids  and glucose  and the cells  red and white cells  and cell fragments called platelets
__label__1 blood is actually a term used to describe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includes plasma  the liquid portion  which contains water  proteins  salts  lipids  and glucose  and the cells  red and white cells  and cell fragments called platelets
__label__0 blood plasma is actually the dominant component of blood and contains the water  proteins  electrolytes  lipids  and glucose
__label__1 the plasma component of blood without the coagulation factors is called the serum
__label__0 serum is similar to interstitial fluid in which the correct composition of key ions acting as electrolytes is essential for normal functioning of muscles and nerves
__label__1 the valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve
__label__0 after it is filled  the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries  by  passing the semilunar valve  or pulmonic valve  to the lungs for re  oxygenation
__label__0 after blood passes through the pulmonary arteries  the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle
__label__0 the inner wall of the heart has a lining called the endocardium
__label__1 the myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall
__label__1 the outer layer of cells is called the epicardium  of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart  it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures
__label__1 the coronary arteries branch from the aorta and surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown
__label__0 they diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied with oxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium where the blood will be re  oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit
__label__0 the heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood
__label__0 the main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body  it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle
__label__1 the cardiac cycle is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart muscles to contract and relax
__label__0 the human heart beats over  times per day
__label__0 the electrical signals and mechanical actions  illustrated in  link   are intimately intertwined
__label__0 the internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial  sa  node  which is located near the wall of the right atrium
__label__0 electrical charges spontaneously pulse from the sa node causing the two atria to contract in unison
__label__1 the iliac artery takes blood to the lower limbs
__label__0 the major arteries diverge into minor arteries  and then smaller vessels called arterioles  to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body
__label__0 the capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart
__label__1 veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart
__label__0 the major veins drain blood from the same organs and limbs that the major arteries supply
__label__0 the lymph fluid passes through lymph nodes before it returns to the heart via the vena cava
__label__1 lymph nodes are specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells
__label__0 the white blood cells remove infectious agents  such as bacteria and viruses  to clean the lymph before it returns to the bloodstream
__label__1 osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane
__label__1 osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance  osmotic balance  across membranes within the body s fluids  which are composed of water  plus electrolytes and non  electrolytes
__label__1 osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance  osmotic balance  across membranes within the body s fluids  which are composed of water  plus electrolytes and non  electrolytes
__label__1 an electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water
__label__0 a non  electrolyte  in contrast  does nt dissociate into ions during water dissolution
__label__0 both electrolytes and non  electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance
__label__0 thus  one mole of sodium chloride weighs  grams
__label__1 the molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution
__label__1 the molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent
__label__0 when they move to a hypertonic marine environment  these fish start drinking sea water  they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine  as illustrated in  link  b
__label__0 most marine invertebrates  on the other hand  may be isotonic with sea water  osmoconformers
__label__0 their body fluid concentrations conform to changes in seawater concentration
__label__0 externally  the kidneys are surrounded by three layers  illustrated in  link
__label__1 the outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia
__label__1 the second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule  which helps anchor the kidneys in place
__label__0 the third and innermost layer is the renal capsule
__label__0 internally  the kidney has three regions  an outer cortex  a medulla in the middle  and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney
__label__1 the hilum is the concave part of the bean  shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney  it is also the point of exit for the ureters
__label__0 the medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses  called the renal pyramids
__label__0 in between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through which the blood vessels pass
__label__0 the tips of the pyramids  called renal papillae  point toward the renal pelvis
__label__0 the renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney
__label__0 on the inside of the kidney  the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces  which further branch into the minor calyces
__label__1 the ureters are urine  bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder
__label__0 renal blood supply starts with the branching of the aorta into the renal arteries  which are each named based on the region of the kidney they pass through  and ends with the exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena cava
__label__0 the renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys
__label__0 each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns  which supply the renal lobes
__label__0 the arcuate  bow shaped  arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids
__label__0 cortical radiate arteries  as the name suggests  radiate out from the arcuate arteries
__label__1 the cortical radiate arteries branch into numerous afferent arterioles  and then enter the capillaries supplying the nephrons
__label__1 the renal corpuscle  located in the renal cortex  is made up of a network of capillaries known as the glomerulus and the capsule  a cup  shaped chamber that surrounds it  called the glomerular or bowman s capsule
__label__1 the second part is called the loop of henle  or nephritic loop  because it forms a loop  with descending and ascending limbs  that goes through the renal medulla
__label__0 the third part of the renal tubule is called the distal convoluted tubule  dct  and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex
__label__1 the dct  which is the last part of the nephron  connects and empties its contents into collecting ducts that line the medullary pyramids
__label__1 within the glomerulus  the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed
__label__0 once the efferent arteriole exits the glomerulus  it forms the peritubular capillary network  which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal tubule
__label__0 in cortical nephrons  the peritubular capillary network surrounds the pct and dct
__label__0 second  the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules
__label__1 most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the pct by a process called tubular reabsorption
__label__0 in the loop of henle  the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network
__label__0 this occurs due to the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries
__label__0 however  every solute has a transport maximum and the excess is not reabsorbed  in the loop of henle  the permeability of the membrane changes
__label__0 despite the ongoing economic recovery  the job market is actually growing in some areas  but in a very polarized fashion
__label__1 polarization means that a gap has developed in the job market  with most employment opportunities at the lowest and highest levels and few jobs for those with midlevel skills and education
__label__0 at one end  there has been strong demand for low  skilled  low  paying jobs in industries like food service and retail
__label__1 for example  in maquiladoras  mostly found in northern mexico  workers may sew imported precut pieces of fabric into garments  globalization also brings an international division of labor  in which comparatively wealthy workers from core nations compete with the low  wage labor pool of peripheral and semi  peripheral nations
__label__1 this can lead to a sense of xenophobia  which is an illogical fear and even hatred of foreigners and foreign goods
__label__0 corporations trying to maximize their profits in the united states are conscious of this risk and attempt to  americanize  their products  selling shirts printed with us flags that were nevertheless made in mexico
__label__0 mechanical solidarity exists in simpler societies where social cohesion comes from sharing similar work  education  and religion
__label__1 organic solidarity arises out of the mutual interdependence created by the specialization of work
__label__0 the complex us economy  and the economies of other industrialized nations  meet the definition of organic solidarity
__label__0 governments tried to protect their share of the markets by developing a system called mercantilism
__label__1 mercantilism is an economic policy based on accumulating silver and gold by controlling colonial and foreign markets through taxes and other charges
__label__0 the resulting restrictive practices and exacting demands included monopolies  bans on certain goods  high tariffs  and exclusivity requirements
__label__1 socialism is an economic system in which there is government ownership  often referred to as  state run   of goods and their production  with an impetus to share work and wealth equally among the members of a society
__label__0 under socialism  everything that people produce  including services  is considered a social product
__label__1 convergence theory explains that as a country s economy grows  its societal organization changes to become more like that of an industrialized society
__label__0 rather than staying in one job for a lifetime  people begin to move from job to job as conditions improve and opportunities arise
__label__0 those working in the symbolic interaction perspective take a microanalytical view of society
__label__0 they focus on the way reality is socially constructed through day  to  day interaction and how society is composed of people communicating based on a shared understanding of symbols
__label__0 one important symbolic interactionist concept related to work and the economy is career inheritance
__label__1 this concept means simply that children tend to enter the same or similar occupation as their parents  which is a correlation that has been demonstrated in research studies  antony
__label__1 caste systems are closed stratification systems in which people can do little or nothing to change their social standing
__label__1 a caste system is one in which people are born into their social standing and will remain in it their whole lives
__label__0 people are assigned occupations regardless of their talents  interests  or potential
__label__0 status consistency
__label__0 social stratification systems determine social position based on factors like income  education  and occupation
__label__1 sociologists use the term status consistency to describe the consistency  or lack thereof  of an individual s rank across these factors
__label__0 caste systems correlate with high status consistency  whereas the more flexible class system has lower status consistency
__label__1 social mobilitysocial mobility refers to the ability to change positions within a social stratification system
__label__0 when people improve or diminish their economic status in a way that affects social class  they experience social mobility
__label__1 dropping out of school  losing a job  or getting a divorce may result in a loss of income or status and  therefore  downward social mobility  it is not uncommon for different generations of a family to belong to varying social classes
__label__0 this is known as intergenerational mobility
__label__0 for example  an upper  class executive may have parents who belonged to the middle class
__label__1 class traits  also called class markers  are the typical behaviors  customs  and norms that define each class
__label__0 class traits indicate the level of exposure a person has to a wide range of cultures
__label__1 to symbolically communicate social standing  people often engage in conspicuous consumption  which is the purchase and use of certain products to make a social statement about status
__label__0 carrying pricey but eco  friendly water bottles could indicate a person s social standing
__label__0 while stratification in the united states refers to the unequal distribution of resources among individuals  global stratification refers to this unequal distribution among nations
__label__0 there are two dimensions to this stratification  gaps between nations and gaps within nations
__label__1 the poorest  most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of sub  saharan africa  latin america  and asia
__label__1 the second world was the in  between category  nations not as limited in development as the third world  but not as well off as the first world  having moderate economies and standard of living  such as china or cuba
__label__0 later  sociologist manual castells    added the term fourth world to refer to stigmatized minority groups that were denied a political voice all over the globe  indigenous minority populations  prisoners  and the homeless  for example
__label__0 for example  wallerstein contends that the united states is an economic powerhouse that can support or deny support to important economic legislation with far  reaching implications  thus exerting control over every aspect of the global economy and exploiting both semi  peripheral and peripheral nations
__label__0 we can look at free trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement  nafta  as an example of how a core nation is able to leverage its power to gain the most advantageous position in the matter of global trade
__label__0 peripheral nations have very little industrialization  what they do have often represents the outdated castoffs of core nations or the factories and means of production owned by core nations
__label__0 they typically have unstable governments  inadequate social programs  and are economically dependent on core nations for jobs and aid
__label__0 some of these countries include the united states  germany  canada  and the united kingdom  world bank b
__label__0 high  income countries face two major issues  capital flight and deindustrialization
__label__1 capital flight refers to the movement  flight  of capital from one nation to another  as when general motors automotive company closed us factories in michigan and opened factories in mexico
__label__1 deindustrialization  a related issue  occurs as a consequence of capital flight  as no new companies open to replace jobs lost to foreign nations
__label__0 social scientists define global poverty in different ways and take into account the complexities and the issues of relativism described above
__label__1 relative poverty is a state of living where people can afford necessities but are unable to meet their society s average standard of living
__label__0 people often disparage  keeping up with the joneses   the idea that you must keep up with the neighbors  standard of living to not feel deprived
__label__0 what do the driver of an unlicensed hack cab in new york  a piecework seamstress working from her home in mumbai  and a street tortilla vendor in mexico city have in common
__label__1 they are all members of the underground economy  a loosely defined unregulated market unhindered by taxes  government permits  or human protections
__label__0 official statistics before the worldwide recession posit that the underground economy accounted for over  percent of nonagricultural work in latin america  the figure went as high as  percent in parts of asia and africa  chen
__label__1 according to modernization theory  low  income countries are affected by their lack of industrialization and can improve their global economic standing through  armer and katsillis    an adjustment of cultural values and attitudes to work
__label__0 their labels for racial groups have connoted regions  mongolia and the caucus mountains  for instance  or skin tones  black  white  yellow  and red  for example
__label__0 social science organizations including the american association of anthropologists  the american sociological association  and the american psychological association have all taken an official position rejecting the biological explanations of race
__label__0 over time  the typology of race that developed during early racial science has fallen into disuse  and the social construction of race is a more sociological way of understanding racial categories
__label__0 research in this school of thought suggests that race is not biologically identifiable and that previous racial categories were arbitrarily assigned  based on pseudoscience  and used to justify racist practices  omi and winant   graves
__label__1 scapegoat theory  developed initially from dollard s    frustration  aggression theory  suggests that the dominant group will displace its unfocused aggression onto a subordinate group
__label__0 history has shown us many examples of the scapegoating of a subordinate group
__label__1 a prejudice is not based on experience  instead  it is a prejudgment  originating outside actual experience
__label__0 a  documentary called eye of the storm illustrates the way in which prejudice develops  by showing how defining one category of people as superior  children with blue eyes  results in prejudice against people who are not part of the favored category
__label__1 while prejudice is not necessarily specific to race  racism is a stronger type of prejudice used to justify the belief that one racial category is somehow superior or inferior to others  it is also a set of practices used by a racial majority to disadvantage a racial minority
__label__0 the ku klux klan is an example of a racist organization  its members  belief in white supremacy has encouraged over a century of hate crime and hate speech
__label__1 while prejudice refers to biased thinking  discrimination consists of actions against a group of people
__label__0 discrimination can be based on age  religion  health  and other indicators  race  based laws against discrimination strive to address this set of social problems
__label__0 in the days after  it was revealed that only three members of the town s fifty  three  member police force were black  nobles and bosman
__label__0 the national dialogue shifted during the next few weeks  with some commentators pointing to a nationwide sedimentation of racial inequality and identifying redlining in ferguson as a cause of the unbalanced racial composition in the community  in local political establishments  and in the police force  bouie
__label__1 redlining is the practice of routinely refusing mortgages for households and businesses located in predominately minority communities  while sedimentation of racial inequality describes the intergenerational impact of both practical and legalized racism that limits the abilities of black people to accumulate wealth
__label__1 culture of prejudice refers to the theory that prejudice is embedded in our culture
__label__0 we grow up surrounded by images of stereotypes and casual expressions of racism and prejudice
__label__1 segregation refers to the physical separation of two groups  particularly in residence  but also in workplace and social functions
__label__1 it is important to distinguish between de jure segregation  segregation that is enforced by law  and de facto segregation  segregation that occurs without laws but because of other factors
__label__1 amalgamation is the process by which a minority group and a majority group combine to form a new group
__label__0 amalgamation creates the classic  melting pot  analogy  unlike the  salad bowl   in which each culture retains its individuality  the  melting pot  ideal sees the combination of cultures that results in a new culture entirely
__label__0 amalgamation  also known as miscegenation  is achieved through intermarriage between races
__label__1 sex refers to physical or physiological differences between males and females  including both primary sex characteristics  the reproductive system  and secondary characteristics such as height and muscularity
__label__1 gender refers to behaviors  personal traits  and social positions that society attributes to being female or male
__label__0 a person s sex  as determined by his or her biology  does not always correspond with his or her gender
__label__0 therefore  the terms sex and gender are not interchangeable
__label__0 much of this discrimination is based on stereotypes and misinformation
__label__1 some is based on heterosexism  which herek    suggests is both an ideology and a set of institutional practices that privilege heterosexuals and heterosexuality over other sexual orientations
__label__0 much like racism and sexism  heterosexism is a systematic disadvantage embedded in our social institutions  offering power to those who conform to hetereosexual orientation while simultaneously disadvantaging those who do not
__label__0 to a certain extent  men can assume some feminine roles and women can assume some masculine roles without interfering with their gender identity
__label__1 gender identity is a person s deeply held internal perception of his or her gender
__label__1 individuals who identify with the role that is the different from their biological sex are called transgender
__label__0 gender dysphoria  on the other hand  removes some of that stigma by taking the word
__label__1 in the dsm  gender dysphoria is a condition of people whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with
__label__0 for a person to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria  there must be a marked difference between the individual s expressed  experienced gender and the gender others would assign him or her  and it must continue for at least six months
__label__0 in other words  both gender and sexuality are socially constructed
__label__1 the social construction of sexuality refers to the way in which socially created definitions about the cultural appropriateness of sex  linked behavior shape the way people see and experience sexuality
__label__0 this is in marked contrast to theories of sex  gender  and sexuality that link male and female behavior to biological determinism  or the belief that men and women behave differently due to differences in their biology
__label__1 queer theoryqueer theory is an interdisciplinary approach to sexuality studies that identifies western society s rigid splitting of gender into male and female roles and questions the manner in which we have been taught to think about sexual orientation
__label__0 according to jagose     queer  theory  focuses on mismatches between anatomical sex  gender identity  and sexual orientation  not just division into male  female or homosexual  hetereosexual
__label__1 gerontology is a field of science that seeks to understand the process of aging and the challenges encountered as seniors grow older
__label__0 gerontologists investigate age  aging  and the aged
__label__0 each person experiences age  related changes based on many factors
__label__1 biological factors such as molecular and cellular changes are called primary aging  while aging that occurs due to controllable factors such as lack of physical exercise and poor diet is called secondary aging  whitbourne and whitbourne
__label__0 should patients have the right to choose to die with dignity
__label__1 dr jack kevorkian was a staunch advocate for physician  assisted suicide  the voluntary or physician  assisted use of lethal medication provided by a medical doctor to end one s life
__label__0 this right to have a doctor help a patient die with dignity is controversial
__label__0 he did nt intend to treat people differently based on personal or cultural biases  but he did
__label__1 ageism is discrimination  when someone acts on a prejudice  based on age
__label__0 dr robert butler coined the term in   noting that ageism exists in all cultures  brownell
__label__0 there are three classic theories of aging within the conflict perspective
__label__1 modernization theory  cowgill and holmes   suggests that the primary cause of the elderly losing power and influence in society are the parallel forces of industrialization and modernization
__label__0 as societies modernize  the status of elders decreases  and they are increasingly likely to experience social exclusion
__label__1 one microanalytical theory is rose s    subculture of aging theory  which focuses on the shared community created by the elderly when they are excluded  due to age   voluntarily or involuntarily  from participating in other groups
__label__0 this theory suggests that elders will disengage from society and develop new patterns of interaction with peers who share common backgrounds and interests
__label__0 a family of orientation refers to the family into which a person is born
__label__0 a family of procreation describes one that is formed through marriage
__label__0 these distinctions have cultural significance related to issues of lineage  drawing on two sociological paradigms  the sociological understanding of what constitutes a family can be explained by symbolic interactionism as well as functionalism
__label__0 in many countries and cultures around the world  however  having one spouse is not the only form of marriage
__label__1 in a majority of cultures   percent   polygamy  or being married to more than one person at a time  is accepted  murdock    with most polygamous societies existing in northern africa and east asia  altman and ginat
__label__0 instances of polygamy are almost exclusively in the form of polygyny
__label__0 in the united states  polygamy is considered by most to be socially unacceptable and it is illegal
__label__1 the act of entering into marriage while still married to another person is referred to as bigamy and is considered a felony in most states
__label__0 polygamy in the united states is often associated with those of the mormon faith  although in  the mormon church officially renounced polygamy
__label__0 sixty percent of societies  mostly modernized nations  follow a bilateral descent pattern
__label__1 unilateral descent  the tracing of kinship through one parent only  is practiced in the other  percent of the world s societies  with high concentration in pastoral cultures  oneal
__label__0 patrilocal residence is thought to be disadvantageous to women because it makes them outsiders in the home and community  it also keeps them disconnected from their own blood relatives
__label__0 in china  where patrilocal and patrilineal customs are common  the written symbols for maternal grandmother  wip  are separately translated to mean  outsider  and  women   cohen
__label__1 similarly  in matrilocal residence systems  where it is customary for the husband to live with his wife s blood relatives  or her family of orientation   the husband can feel disconnected and can be labeled as an outsider
__label__0 the minangkabau people  a matrilocal society that is indigenous to the highlands of west sumatra in indonesia  believe that home is the place of women and they give men little power in issues relating to the home or family  joseph and najmabadi
__label__0 this is a decrease from  percent in   us census
__label__1 this two  parent family structure is known as a nuclear family  referring to married parents and children as the nucleus  or core  of the group
__label__0 recent years have seen a rise in variations of the nuclear family with the parents not being married
__label__1 religious experience refers to the conviction or sensation that we are connected to  the divine
__label__0 this type of communion might be experienced when people are pray or meditate
__label__1 religious beliefs are specific ideas members of a particular faith hold to be true  such as that jesus christ was the son of god  or that reincarnation exists
__label__0 another illustration of religious beliefs is the creation stories we find in different religions
__label__0 the term ecclesia  originally referring to a political assembly of citizens in ancient athens  greece  now refers to a congregation
__label__1 in sociology  the term is used to refer to a religious group that most all members of a society belong to
__label__1 similarly  many westerners view the multiple manifestations of hinduism s godhead as polytheistic  which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities   while hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the christian trinity
__label__1 some japanese practice shinto  which follows animism  which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings  like animals  plants  and objects of the natural world  while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings
__label__1 it is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers  such as atheists  who do not believe in a divine being or entity  and agnostics  who hold that ultimate reality  such as god  is unknowable
__label__1 a megachurch is a christian church that has a very large congregation averaging more than  people who attend regular weekly services
__label__0 as of   the largest megachurch in the united states was in houston texas  boasting an average weekly attendance of more than   bogan
__label__1 in contrast  informal education describes learning about cultural values  norms  and expected behaviors by participating in a society
__label__0 this type of learning occurs both through the formal education system and at home
__label__0 education also provides one of the major methods used by people for upward social mobility
__label__0 this function is referred to as social placement
__label__0 college and graduate schools are viewed as vehicles for moving students closer to the careers that will give them the financial freedom and security they seek
__label__0 many argue that the tests group students by cultural ability rather than by natural intelligence
__label__1 the cycle of rewarding those who possess cultural capital is found in formal educational curricula as well as in the hidden curriculum  which refers to the type of nonacademic knowledge that students learn through informal learning and cultural transmission
__label__0 this hidden curriculum reinforces the positions of those with higher cultural capital and serves to bestow status unequally
__label__0 the labeling with which symbolic interactionists concern themselves extends to the very degrees that symbolize completion of education
__label__1 credentialism embodies the emphasis on certificates or degrees to show that a person has a certain skill  has attained a certain level of education  or has met certain job qualifications
__label__0 these certificates or degrees serve as a symbol of what a person has achieved  and allows the labeling of that individual
__label__0 opined   the measure of a man is what he does with power   and lord acton perhaps more famously asserted   power tends to corrupt  absolute power corrupts absolutely
__label__0 indeed  the concept of power can have decidedly negative connotations  and the term itself is difficult to define
__label__1 many scholars adopt the definition developed by german sociologist max weber  who said that power is the ability to exercise one s will over others  weber
__label__0 power affects more than personal relationships  it shapes larger dynamics like social groups  professional organizations  and governments
__label__1 most people generally agree that anarchy  or the absence of organized government  does not facilitate a desirable living environment for society  but it is much harder for individuals to agree upon the particulars of how a population should be governed
__label__0 throughout history  various forms of government have evolved to suit the needs of changing populations and mindsets  each with pros and cons
__label__1 in today s global political climate  monarchies far more often take the form of constitutional monarchies  governments of nations that recognize monarchs but require these figures to abide by the laws of a greater constitution
__label__0 many countries that are now constitutional monarchies evolved from governments that were once considered absolute monarchies
__label__0 the late kim jong  il  north korean dictator  and his successor  kim jong  un  exemplify this type of charismatic dictatorship  some dictatorships do not align themselves with any particular belief system or ideology  the goal of this type of regime is usually limited to preserving the authority of the dictator
__label__1 a totalitarian dictatorship is even more oppressive and attempts to control all aspects of its subjects  lives  including occupation  religious beliefs  and number of children permitted in each family
__label__0 citizens may be forced to publicly demonstrate their faith in the regime by participating in marches and demonstrations
__label__0 political science looks at politics as the interaction between citizens and their government
__label__1 sociology studies politics as a means to understand the underlying social norms and values of a group
__label__0 another key exception to the right to freedom of expression is obscenity  acts or statements that are extremely offensive under current societal standards
__label__0 defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts  supreme court justice potter stewart famously said of obscenity  having watched pornography in the supreme court building   i know it when i see it
__label__0 into the early twentieth century  written work was frequently banned as being obscene  including works by noted authors such as james joyce and henry miller  although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone
__label__0 in   the supreme court established the miller test for deciding whether something is obscene    a  whether the average person  applying contemporary community standards  would find that the work  taken as a whole  appeals to the prurient interest   b  whether the work depicts or describes  in a patently offensive way  sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law  and  c  whether the work  taken as a whole  lacks serious literary  artistic  political  or scientific value
__label__0 miller v california   us
__label__0 however  the application of this standard has at times been problematic
__label__0 furthermore  the courts have ruled that  although public school officials are government actors  the first amendment freedom of expression rights of children attending public schools are somewhat limited
__label__0 in particular  in tinker v des moines    and hazelwood v kuhlmeier     the supreme court has upheld restrictions on speech that creates  substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others
__label__0 tinker v des moines independent community school district   us
__label__0 or is  reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns
__label__0 hazelwood school district et al
__label__0 v kuhlmeier et al    us
__label__0 for example  the content of school  sponsored activities like school newspapers and speeches delivered by students can be controlled  either for the purposes of instructing students in proper adult behavior or to deter conflict between students
__label__0 before the civil war  this would have been a nearly meaningless distinction
__label__0 in most states at that time  white males of military age were considered part of the militia  liable to be called for service to put down rebellions or invasions  and the right  to keep and bear arms  was considered a common  law right inherited from english law that predated the federal and state constitutions
__label__0 the constitution was not seen as a limitation on state power  and since the states expected all able  bodied free men to keep arms as a matter of course  what gun control there was mostly revolved around ensuring slaves  and their abolitionist allies  did nt have guns
__label__0 however  in   in a narrow    decision on district of columbia v heller  the supreme court found that at least some gun control laws did violate the second amendment and that this amendment does protect an individual s right to keep and bear arms  at least in some circumstances  in particular   for traditionally lawful purposes  such as self  defense within the home
__label__0 district of columbia et al v heller   us      p
__label__0 because the district of columbia is not a state  this decision immediately applied the right only to the federal government and territorial governments
__label__0 the fourth amendment sits at the boundary between general individual freedoms and the rights of those suspected of crimes
__label__0 we saw earlier that perhaps it reflects james madison s broader concern about establishing an expectation of privacy from government intrusion at home
__label__0 what happens if the police conduct an illegal search or seizure without a warrant and find evidence of a crime
__label__0 in the  supreme court case mapp v ohio  the court decided that evidence obtained without a warrant that did nt fall under one of the exceptions mentioned above could not be used as evidence in a state criminal trial  giving rise to the broad application of what is known as the exclusionary rule  which was first established in  on a federal level in weeks v united states
__label__0 mapp v ohio   us      weeks v united states   us
__label__0 the exclusionary rule does nt just apply to evidence found or to items or people seized without a warrant  or falling under an exception noted above   it also applies to any evidence developed or discovered as a result of the illegal search or seizure
__label__0 the fifth amendment also protects individuals against double jeopardy  a process that subjects a suspect to prosecution twice for the same criminal act
__label__0 no one who has been acquitted  found not guilty  of a crime can be prosecuted again for that crime
__label__0 moreover  in a criminal trial  if someone does not testify in his or her own defense  the prosecution can not use that failure to testify as evidence of guilt or imply that an innocent person would testify
__label__1 this provision became embedded in the public consciousness following the supreme court s  ruling in miranda v arizona  whereby suspects were required to be informed of their most important rights  including the right against self  incrimination  before being interrogated in police custody
__label__0 miranda v arizona   us
__label__0 however  contrary to some media depictions of the miranda warning  law enforcement officials do not necessarily have to inform suspects of their rights before they are questioned in situations where they are free to leave
__label__0 and  while we traditionally think of property owners as relatively well  off people whose rights do nt necessarily need protecting since they can fend for themselves in the political system  frequently these cases pit lower and middle  class homeowners against multinational corporations or multimillionaires with the ear of city and state officials
__label__1 in a notorious  case  kelo v city of new london  the supreme court sided with municipal officials taking homes in a middle  class neighborhood to obtain land for a large pharmaceutical company s corporate campus
__label__0 kelo et al v city of new london et al    us
__label__0 the case led to a public backlash against the use of eminent domain and legal changes in many states  making it harder for cities to take property from one private party and give it to another for economic redevelopment purposes
__label__1 bail is a payment of money that allows a person accused of a crime to be freed pending trial  if you  make bail  in a case and do not show up for your trial  you will forfeit the money you paid
__label__1 since many people can not afford to pay bail directly  they may instead get a bail bond  which allows them to pay a fraction of the money  typically  percent  to a person who sells bonds and who pays the full bail amount
__label__0 in most states  the bond seller makes money because the defendant does not get back the money for the bond  and most people show up for their trials
__label__0 as this chapter has suggested  the provisions of the bill of rights have been interpreted and reinterpreted repeatedly over the past two centuries
__label__0 however  the first eight amendments are largely silent on the status of traditional common law  which was the legal basis for many of the natural rights claimed by the framers in the declaration of independence
__label__0 unlike the other provisions of the bill of rights  this amendment focuses on power rather than rights
__label__0 the courts have generally read the tenth amendment as merely stating  as chief justice harlan stone put it  a  truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered
__label__0 united states v darby lumber   us
__label__0 in other words  rather than limiting the power of the federal government in any meaningful way  it simply restates what is made obvious elsewhere in the constitution  the federal government has both enumerated and implied powers  but where the federal government does not  or chooses not to  exercise power  the states may do so
__label__0 the legal landscape changed dramatically as a result of the  ruling in roe v wade  roe v wade   us
__label__1 in which the supreme court decided the right to privacy encompassed a right for women to terminate a pregnancy  at least under certain scenarios
__label__0 the justices ruled that while the government did have an interest in protecting the  potentiality of human life   nonetheless this had to be balanced against the interests of both women s health and women s right to decide whether to have an abortion
__label__0 in the united states  many advocates of civil liberties are concerned that laws such as the usa patriot act  ie  uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act   passed weeks after the  attacks in   have given the federal government too much power by making it easy for officials to seek and obtain search warrants or  in some cases  to bypass warrant requirements altogether
__label__0 critics have argued that the patriot act has largely been used to prosecute ordinary criminals  in particular drug dealers  rather than terrorists as intended
__label__1 we can contrast civil rights with civil liberties  which are limitations on government power designed to protect our fundamental freedoms
__label__0 for example  the eighth amendment prohibits the application of  cruel and unusual punishments  to those convicted of crimes  a limitation on government power
__label__0 discrimination based on gender or sex is generally examined with intermediate scrutiny
__label__0 the standard of intermediate scrutiny was first applied by the supreme court in craig v boren    and again in clark v jeter
__label__0 craig v boren   us      clark v jeter   us
__label__0 it requires the government to demonstrate that treating men and women differently is  substantially related to an important governmental objective
__label__0 this puts the burden of proof on the government to demonstrate why the unequal treatment is justifiable  not on the individual who alleges unfair discrimination has taken place
__label__0 in practice  this means laws that treat men and women differently are sometimes upheld  although usually they are not
__label__0 the republican majority in congress was enraged by the actions of the reconstituted governments of the southern states
__label__0 in these states  many former confederate politicians and their sympathizers returned to power and attempted to circumvent the thirteenth amendment s freeing of slaves by passing laws known as the black codes
__label__1 these laws were designed to reduce former slaves to the status of serfs or indentured servants  blacks were not just denied the right to vote but also could be arrested and jailed for vagrancy or idleness if they lacked jobs
__label__0 one way to get involved in the fight for civil rights is to stay informed
__label__1 the southern poverty law center  splc  is a not  for  profit advocacy group based in montgomery  alabama
__label__0 lawyers for the splc specialize in civil rights litigation and represent many people whose rights have been violated  from victims of hate crimes to undocumented immigrants
__label__1 at the end of the civil war  the south entered a period called reconstruction      during which state governments were reorganized before the rebellious states were allowed to be readmitted to the union
__label__0 as part of this process  the republican party pushed for a permanent end to slavery
__label__1 the fifteenth amendment stated that people could not be denied the right to vote based on  race  color  or previous condition of servitude
__label__0 this construction allowed states to continue to decide the qualifications of voters as long as those qualifications were ostensibly race  neutral
__label__0 thus  while states could not deny african american men the right to vote on the basis of race  they could deny it to women on the basis of sex or to people who could not prove they were literate
__label__0 similarly  state and local governments passed laws limiting what neighborhoods blacks and whites could live in
__label__0 collectively  these discriminatory laws came to be known as jim crow laws
__label__0 the supreme court upheld the separate but equal doctrine in  in plessy v ferguson  consistent with the fourteenth amendment s equal protection clause  and allowed segregation to continue
__label__0 plessy v ferguson   us
__label__0 the landmark court decision of the judicial phase of the civil rights movement settled the brown v board of education case in
__label__0 brown v board of education of topeka   us
__label__0 in this case  the supreme court unanimously overturned its decision in plessy v ferguson as it pertained to public education  stating that a separate but equal education was a logical impossibility
__label__0 even with the same funding and equivalent facilities  a segregated school could not have the same teachers or environment as the equivalent school for another race
__label__0 a few months later  in little rock  arkansas  governor orval faubus resisted court  ordered integration and mobilized national guard troops to keep black students out of central high school
__label__0 president eisenhower then called up the arkansas national guard for federal duty  essentially taking the troops out of faubus s hands  and sent soldiers of the st airborne division to escort students to and from classes  as shown in  link
__label__0 to avoid integration  faubus closed four high schools in little rock the following school year  jason sokol
__label__0 the slow rate of progress led to frustration within the african american community
__label__0 newer  grassroots organizations such as the southern christian leadership conference  sclc   congress of racial equality  core   and student non  violent coordinating committee  sncc  challenged the naacp s position as the leading civil rights organization and questioned its legal  focused strategy
__label__0 these newer groups tended to prefer more confrontational approaches  including the use of direct action campaigns relying on marches and demonstrations
__label__0 civil rights pioneers adopted these measures in the    montgomery bus boycott
__label__0 after rosa parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white person and was arrested  a group of black women carried out a day  long boycott of montgomery s public transit system
__label__0 this boycott was then extended for over a year and overseen by union organizer e d nixon
__label__0 as the campaign for civil rights continued and gained momentum  president john f kennedy called for congress to pass new civil rights legislation  which began to work its way through congress in
__label__0 the resulting law  pushed heavily and then signed by president lyndon b
__label__0 even though the civil rights act of  had a monumental impact over the long term  it did not end efforts by many southern whites to maintain the white  dominated political power structure in the region
__label__0 progress in registering african american voters remained slow in many states despite increased federal activity supporting it  so civil rights leaders including martin luther king  jr decided to draw the public eye to the area where the greatest resistance to voter registration drives were taking place
__label__0 the sclc and sncc particularly focused their attention on the city of selma  alabama  which had been the site of violent reactions against civil rights activities
__label__0 martin luther king  jr  left  and malcolm x  right  adopted different approaches to securing civil rights for african americans
__label__0 this occasion  a senate debate of the civil rights act of   was the only time the two men ever met
__label__0 today  a lack of high  paying jobs in many urban areas  combined with persistent racism  has trapped many african americans in poor neighborhoods
__label__0 while the civil rights act of  created opportunities for members of the black middle class to advance economically and socially  and to live in the same neighborhoods as the white middle class did  their departure left many black neighborhoods mired in poverty and without the strong community ties that existed during the era of legal segregation
__label__0 many of these neighborhoods also suffered from high rates of crime and violence
__label__0 jacqueline jones
__label__0 in   stanton and mott called for a women s rights convention  the first ever held specifically to address the subject  at seneca falls  new york

__label__1 in   congress passed the indian reorganization act  which ended the division of reservation land into allotments
__label__0 it returned to native american tribes the right to institute self  government on their reservations  write constitutions  and manage their remaining lands and resources

__label__0 unless you conduct an exit poll during an election and interviewers stand at the polling places on election day to ask voters how they voted  there is always the possibility the poll results will be wrong
__label__0 the simplest reason is that if there is time between the poll and election day  a citizen might change his or her mind  lie  or choose not to vote at all
__label__0 in the  presidential primary race  moveon tried to encourage senator elizabeth warren  d  ma  to enter the race for the democratic nomination   link
__label__0 its poll used leading questions for what it termed an  informed ballot   and  to show that warren would do better than hillary clinton  it included ten positive statements about warren before asking whether the respondent would vote for clinton or warren
__label__0 aaron blake   this terrible polls shows elizabeth warren beating hillary clinton   washington post   february
__label__0 the poll results were blasted by some in the media for being fake
__label__0 in the  governor s race in california  tom bradley was far ahead in the polls  yet on election day he lost
__label__0 this result was nicknamed the bradley effect  on the theory that voters who answered the poll were afraid to admit they would not vote for a black man because it would appear politically incorrect and racist
__label__0 in the  presidential election  the level of support for republican nominee donald trump may have been artificially low in the polls due to the fact that some respondents did not want to admit they were voting for trump
__label__0 in the s  daniel elazar researched interviews  voting data  newspapers  and politicians  speeches
__label__0 he determined that states had unique cultures and that different state governments instilled different attitudes and beliefs in their citizens  creating political cultures
__label__0 some states value tradition  and their laws try to maintain longstanding beliefs
__label__0 news agencies are aware of the relationship between citizens and elites  which is why news anchors for major networks are carefully chosen
__label__0 when brian williams of nbc was accused of lying about his experiences in iraq and new orleans  he was suspended pending an investigation
__label__0 williams later admitted to several misstatements and apologized to the public  and he was removed from the nightly news
__label__0 stephen battaglio   brian williams will leave  nbc nightly news  and join msnbc   la times   june
__label__0 another area where social policy must balance rights and liberties is public safety
__label__0 regulation of gun ownership incites strong emotions  because it invokes the second amendment and state culture
__label__0 of those polled nationwide   percent believed government should protect the right of citizens to own guns  while  percent felt there should be stronger controls over gun ownership

__label__0 george w bush s average approval rating from  to  was  percent
__label__0 ronald reagan s from  to  was  percent  despite his winning all but thirteen electoral votes in his reelection bid
__label__0 bill clinton s average approval from  to  was  percent  including the months surrounding the monica lewinsky scandal and his subsequent impeachment
__label__0 in   democratic president bill clinton and the republican congress hit a notable stalemate on the national budget
__label__0 in this case  the republicans had recently gained control of the house of representatives and disagreed with democrats and the president on how to cut spending and reduce the deficit
__label__0 knowing the supreme court
__label__0 a reconsideration of public ignorance of the high court   journal of politics
__label__1 for example  following the bush v gore case     in which the court instructed florida to stop recounting ballots and george w bush won the electoral college   percent of republicans approved of the court  versus only  percent of democrats
__label__0 bush v gore   us
__label__0 twelve years later  when the supreme court s ruling in national federation of independent business v sebelius    let stand the affordable care act s requirement of individual coverage  approval by democrats increased to  percent  while republican support dropped to  percent
__label__0 national federation of independent business v sebelius   us        andrew dugan
__label__0 the media use public opinion polls to decide which candidates are ahead of the others and therefore of interest to voters and worthy of interview
__label__0 from the moment president obama was inaugurated for his second term  speculation began about who would run in the  presidential election
__label__0 within a year  potential candidates were being ranked and compared by a number of newspapers
__label__0 paul hitlin
__label__0 this was apparent in the run  up to the  presidential election
__label__0 bernie sanders  hillary clinton  and martin omalley each campaigned in the hope of becoming the democratic presidential nominee
__label__0 in june    percent of democrats likely to vote in their state primaries said they would vote for clinton  while  percent of those polled said they would vote for sanders
__label__0 this is especially true if the president has a mandate  which is more than half the popular vote
__label__0 barack obama s recent  victory was a mandate with  percent of the popular vote and  percent of the electoral college vote

__label__0 president obama changed his mind and ultimately allowed russian president vladimir putin to negotiate syria s surrender of its chemical weapons
__label__0 beyond voter polls  congressional representatives are also very interested in polls that reveal the wishes of interest groups and businesses
__label__0 if aarp  one of the largest and most active groups of voters in the united states  is unhappy with a bill  members of the relevant congressional committees will take that response into consideration
__label__0 if the pharmaceutical or oil industry is unhappy with a new patent or tax policy  its members  opinions will have some effect on representatives  decisions  since these industries contribute heavily to election campaigns
__label__0 they include general elections for president and statewide offices  eg  governor and us senator   and they are often organized and paid for by the states
__label__0 because political cultures vary from state to state  the process of voter registration similarly varies
__label__0 for example  suppose an year  old retiree with an expired driver s license wants to register to vote
__label__1 grandfather clauses exempted individuals from taking literacy tests or paying poll taxes if they or their fathers or grandfathers had been permitted to vote prior to a certain point in time
__label__0 while the supreme court determined that grandfather clauses were unconstitutional in   states continued to use poll taxes and literacy tests to deter potential voters from registering  guinn v united states   us
__label__0 states also ignored instances of violence and intimidation against african americans wanting to register or vote  medvic  campaigns and elections
__label__0 the ratification of the twenty  fourth amendment in  ended poll taxes  but the passage of the voting rights act  vra  in  had a more profound effect   link
__label__0 the act protected the rights of minority voters by prohibiting state laws that denied voting rights based on race
__label__0 whether the form is online or on paper  the prospective voter will list his or her name  residency address  and in many cases party identification  with independent as an option  and affirm that he or she is competent to vote
__label__0 states may also have a residency requirement  which establishes how long a citizen must live in a state before becoming eligible to register  it is often thirty days
__label__0 beyond these requirements  there may be an oath administered or more questions asked  such as felony convictions
__label__0 during the  election  in which george w bush won florida s electoral votes by a slim majority  attention turned to the state s election procedures and voter registration rolls
__label__0 journalists found that many states  including florida  had large numbers of phantom voters on their rolls  voters had moved or died but remained on the states  voter registration rolls
__label__0 unusable  voter rolls   wall street journal   november
__label__1 the help america vote act of   hava  was passed in order to reform voting across the states and reduce these problems
__label__0 as part of the act  states were required to update voting equipment  make voting more accessible to the disabled  and maintain computerized voter rolls that could be updated regularly
__label__0 one hundred seventh congress of the united states of america at the second session    january   httpwwweacgovassetsworkflowstagingpagepdf
__label__0 despite these efforts  a study commissioned by the pew charitable trust found twenty  four million voter registrations nationwide were no longer valid
__label__0 pam fessler   study   million dead people still registered to vote   national public radio   february    report  inaccurate  costly  an inefficient   the pew charitable trusts  february
__label__0 pew is now working with eight states to update their voter registration rolls and encouraging more states to share their rolls in an effort to find duplicates
__label__0 fessler   study   million dead people still registered to vote
__label__0 a healthy democratic society is expected to be filled with citizens who vote regularly and participate in the electoral process
__label__0 organizations like rock the vote and project vote smart   link   work alongside mtv to increase voter turnout in all age groups across the united states
__label__0 but just how low is voter turnout
__label__0 some campaigns and civic groups target members of the voting  eligible population who are not registered  especially in states that are highly contested during a particular election
__label__0 the association of community organizations for reform now  acorn   which is now defunct  was both lauded and criticized for its efforts to get voters in low socio  economic areas registered during the  election  michael b farrell
__label__0 september
__label__0 in   for the first time since   a presidential candidate intrigued america s youth and persuaded them to flock to the polls in record numbers
__label__0 barack obama not only spoke to young people s concerns but his campaign also connected with them via technology  wielding texts and tweets to bring together a new generation of voters   link
__label__0 the american civil liberties union and other groups argued that it placed an unfair burden on people who were poor  older  or had limited finances  while the state argued that it would prevent fraud
__label__1 in crawford v marion county election board     the supreme court decided that indiana s voter identification requirement was constitutional  although the decision left open the possibility that another case might meet the burden of proof required to overturn the law
__label__1 david stout   supreme court upholds voter identification law in indiana   new york times   april   crawford v marion county election board   us
__label__0 because the presidential candidate with the highest number of popular votes receives all of utah s and california s electoral votes  there is little incentive for some citizens to vote  they will never change the outcome of the state  level election
__label__0 these citizens  as well as those who vote for third parties like the green party or the libertarian party  are sometimes referred to as the chronic minority
__label__0 while third  party candidates sometimes win local or state office or even dramatize an issue for national discussion  such as when ross perot discussed the national debt during his campaign as an independent presidential candidate in   they never win national elections
__label__0 in the  presidential election cycle  candidates for all parties raised a total of over   billion dollars for campaigns
__label__0 presidential campaign finance   httpwwwfecgovdisclosureppnationaldojsessionidebdccdcbaworker  november
__label__0 congressional candidates running in the  senate elections raised   million  while candidates running for the house of representatives raised   billion
__label__0 house and senate campaign finance   httpwwwfecgovdisclosurehshsnationaldojsessionideedceffdcccworker  november
__label__0 this  however  pales in comparison to the amounts raised by political action committees  pacs   which are organizations created to raise and spend money to influence politics and contribute to candidates  campaigns
__label__0 in the  congressional elections  pacs raised over   billion to help candidates and political parties
__label__0 political action committees   httpwwwopensecretsorgpacs  november
__label__0 how does the government monitor the vast amounts of money that are now a part of the election process
__label__0 while some portions of the feca were ruled unconstitutional by the courts in buckley v valeo     such as limits on personal spending on campaigns by candidates not using federal money  the fec began enforcing campaign finance laws in
__label__0 buckley v valeo   us
__label__0 even with the new laws and the fec  money continued to flow into elections
__label__0 the first  mcconnell v federal election commission     resulted in the supreme court s upholding the act s restrictions on how candidates and parties could spend campaign contributions
__label__0 but later court challenges led to the removal of limits on personal spending and ended the ban on ads run by interest groups in the days leading up to an election
__label__0 court case abstracts   httpwwwfecgovlawlitigationccawshtml  november      davis v federal election commission   us
__label__0 in   the supreme court s ruling on citizens united v federal election commission led to the removal of spending limits on corporations
__label__0 justices in the majority argued that the bcra violated a corporation s free speech rights
__label__0 citizens united v fec   us
__label__0 parties prefer this method  because it ensures the nominee is picked by voters who legitimately support the party
__label__0 an open primary allows all voters to vote
__label__0 in this system  a green party member is allowed to pick either a democratic or republican ballot when voting
__label__0 volunteers record the votes and no poll workers need to be trained or compensated
__label__0 the party members at the caucus also help select delegates  who represent their choice at the party s state or national  level nominating convention
__label__1 this list of issues that concern local party members  like limiting abortions in a state or removing restrictions on gun ownership  are called planks  and they will be discussed and voted upon by the delegates and party leadership at the convention
__label__1 just as wood planks make a platform  issues important to the party and party delegates make up the party platform
__label__0 the parties take the cohesive list of issues and concerns and frame the election around the platform
__label__0 once the voters have cast ballots in november and all the election season madness comes to a close  races for governors and local representatives may be over  but the constitutional process of electing a president has only begun
__label__0 the electors of the electoral college travel to their respective state capitols and cast their votes in mid  december  often by signing a certificate recording their vote
__label__0 in most cases  electors cast their ballots for the candidate who won the majority of votes in their state
__label__0 yet they are not the only important elections
__label__0 the even  numbered years between presidential years  like  and   are reserved for congressional elections  sometimes referred to as midterm elections because they are in the middle of the president s term
__label__0 midterm elections are held because all members of the house of representatives and one  third of the senators come up for reelection every two years
__label__0 early in the  election season  several candidates had fundraised well ahead of their opponents
__label__0 hillary clinton  jeb bush  and ted cruz were the top fundraisers by july
__label__0 clinton reported   million  cruz with   million  and bush with   million in contributions
__label__1 president lyndon b johnson used the infamous  daisy girl  ad  which cut from a little girl counting daisy petals to an atomic bomb being dropped  to explain why voters needed to turn out and vote for him
__label__0 if the voters stayed home  johnson implied  his opponent  republican barry goldwater  might start an atomic war
__label__0 also  they have sometimes been negative and nasty
__label__0 the   coffin handbill  that john quincy adams ran  for instance  listed the names and circumstances of the executions his opponent andrew jackson had ordered   link
__label__0 this was in addition to gossip and verbal attacks against jackson s wife  who had accidentally committed bigamy when she married him without a proper divorce
__label__0 straight  ticket voting does have the advantage of reducing ballot fatigue
__label__1 ballot fatigue occurs when someone votes only for the top or important ballot positions  such as president or governor  and stops voting rather than continue to the bottom of a long ballot
__label__0 the most common form of direct democracy is the initiative  or proposition
__label__0 an initiative is normally a law or constitutional amendment proposed and passed by the citizens of a state
__label__0 just a few years later  however  in gonzales v raich     the supreme court ruled that the us government had the authority to criminalize the use of marijuana
__label__0 in   attorney general eric holder said the federal government would not seek to prosecute patients using marijuana medically  citing limited resources and other priorities
__label__0 perhaps emboldened by the national government s stance  colorado voters approved recreational marijuana use in
__label__0 when citizens rely on television ads  initiative titles  or advice from others in determining how to vote  they can become confused and make the wrong decisions
__label__0 in   californians voted on proposition   titled  eliminates rights of same  sex couples to marry   a yes vote meant a voter wanted to define marriage as only between a woman and man
__label__0 even though the information was clear and the law was one of the shortest in memory  many voters were confused
__label__1 the term media defines a number of different communication formats from television media  which share information through broadcast airwaves  to print media  which rely on printed documents
__label__1 the collection of all forms of media that communicate information to the general public is called mass media  including television  print  radio  and internet
__label__0 one of the primary reasons citizens turn to the media is for news
__label__0 as the chief international correspondent for cnn  christiane amanpour is one media decision maker   link
__label__0 over the years  amanpour has covered events around the world from war to genocide
__label__0 yet readers still wanted to be entertained
__label__0 joseph pulitzer and the new york world gave them what they wanted
__label__1 each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light  which is the absorption spectrum
__label__1 the graph in  link  shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll a  chlorophyll b  and a type of carotenoid pigment called   carotene  which absorbs blue and green light
__label__0 both photosystems have the same basic structure  a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place
__label__1 each photosystem is serviced by the light  harvesting complex  which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center  it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of    chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids
__label__0 the reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules with a special property
__label__0 those two chlorophylls can undergo oxidation upon excitation  they can actually give up an electron in a process called a photoact
__label__0 it is at this step in the reaction center  this step in photosynthesis  that light energy is converted into an excited electron
__label__0 because the electrons have lost energy prior to their arrival at psi  they must be re  energized by psi  hence  another photon is absorbed by the psi antenna
__label__1 that energy is relayed to the psi reaction center  called p
__label__0 p is oxidized and sends a high  energy electron to nadp to form nadph
__label__0 that is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by pga
__label__1 recall that a reduction is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule
__label__0 six molecules of both atp and nadph are used
__label__0 an easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the latin origin of the prefixes  inter means
__label__0 chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small  usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands
__label__1 a ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule  in some cases  delivering a signal in the process
__label__0 ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules
__label__1 the junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse
__label__1 a synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells
__label__0 signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast  moving electrical impulses
__label__1 signals from distant cells are called endocrine signals  and they originate from endocrine cells
__label__0 in the body  many endocrine cells are located in endocrine glands  such as the thyroid gland  the hypothalamus  and the pituitary gland
__label__1 internal receptors  also known as intracellular or cytoplasmic receptors  are found in the cytoplasm of the cell and respond to hydrophobic ligand molecules that are able to travel across the plasma membrane
__label__0 once inside the cell  many of these molecules bind to proteins that act as regulators of mrna synthesis  transcription  to mediate gene expression
__label__1 ion channel  linked receptors bind a ligand and open a channel through the membrane that allows specific ions to pass through
__label__0 to form a channel  this type of cell  surface receptor has an extensive membrane  spanning region
__label__1 once a ligand binds to a receptor  the signal is transmitted through the membrane and into the cytoplasm
__label__0 continuation of a signal in this manner is called signal transduction
__label__0 signal transduction only occurs with cell  surface receptors because internal receptors are able to interact directly with dna in the nucleus to initiate protein synthesis
__label__0 after the ligand binds to the cell  surface receptor  the activation of the receptor s intracellular components sets off a chain of events that is called a signaling pathway or a signaling cascade
__label__1 in a signaling pathway  second messengers  enzymes  and activated proteins interact with specific proteins  which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to a change in the cell s environment   link
__label__1 second messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor
__label__0 these molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain cellular proteins
__label__1 present in small concentrations in the plasma membrane  inositol phospholipids are lipids that can also be converted into second messengers
__label__0 because these molecules are membrane components  they are located near membrane  bound receptors and can easily interact with them
__label__0 cells do not normally divide unless they are stimulated by signals from other cells
__label__1 the ligands that promote cell growth are called growth factors
__label__0 most growth factors bind to cell  surface receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases
__label__1 for example  phosphatases are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called dephosphorylation
__label__0 cyclic amp  camp  is degraded into amp by phosphodiesterase  and the release of calcium stores is reversed by the ca  pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell
__label__0 quorum sensing uses autoinducers as signaling molecules
__label__1 autoinducers are signaling molecules secreted by bacteria to communicate with other bacteria of the same kind
__label__0 the secreted autoinducers can be small  hydrophobic molecules such as acyl  homoserine lactone   ahl  or larger peptide  based molecules  each type of molecule has a different mode of action
__label__0 each species of eukaryotes has a characteristic number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells
__label__0 human body cells have  chromosomes  while human gametes  sperm or eggs  have  chromosomes each
__label__1 a typical body cell  or somatic cell  contains two matched sets of chromosomes  a configuration known as diploid
__label__1 matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous   same knowledge   chromosomes  homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location  or locus
__label__1 the dna  histone complex is called chromatin
__label__1 the beadlike  histone dna complex is called a nucleosome  and dna connecting the nucleosomes is called linker dna
__label__0 a dna molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones  and the beads are about  nm in diameter  in contrast with the nm diameter of a dna double helix
__label__1 the cell cycle is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells
__label__0 cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth  dna replication  and division that produces two identical  clone  cells
__label__1 the first stage of interphase is called the g phase  first gap  because  from a microscopic aspect  little change is visible
__label__0 however  during the g stage  the cell is quite active at the biochemical level
__label__1 the two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle  the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis
__label__1 at the center of each animal cell  the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod  like objects  the centrioles  which are at right angles to each other
__label__0 centrioles help organize cell division
__label__1 karyokinesis  also known as mitosis  is divided into a series of phases  prophase  prometaphase  metaphase  anaphase  and telophase  that result in the division of the cell nucleus   link
__label__0 karyokinesis is also called mitosis
__label__1 during prometaphase  the  first change phase   many processes that were begun in prophase continue to advance
__label__0 the remnants of the nuclear envelope fragment
__label__1 during anaphase  the  upward phase   the cohesin proteins degrade  and the sister chromatids separate at the centromere
__label__0 each chromatid  now called a chromosome  is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which its microtubule is attached
__label__1 the actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward  forming a fissure
__label__0 this fissure  or  crack   is called the cleavage furrow
__label__0 the furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts  and eventually the membrane is cleaved in two   link
__label__0 in plant cells  a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells
__label__0 cells in g phase are not actively preparing to divide
__label__1 the cell is in a quiescent  inactive  stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle
__label__0 some cells enter g temporarily until an external signal triggers the onset of g
__label__0 tumor suppressor geneslike proto  oncogenes  many of the negative cell cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become cancerous
__label__1 tumor suppressor genes are segments of dna that code for negative regulator proteins  the type of regulators that  when activated  can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division
__label__0 the collective function of the best  understood tumor suppressor gene proteins  rb  p  and p  is to put up a roadblock to cell cycle progression until certain events are completed
__label__0 the best understood negative regulatory molecules are retinoblastoma protein  rb   p  and p
__label__1 retinoblastoma proteins are a group of tumor  suppressor proteins common in many cells
__label__0 after the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell  cytoplasmic separation begins
__label__0 the formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called ftsz directs the partition between the nucleoids
__label__0 formation of the ftsz ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site
__label__1 most animals and plants are diploid  containing two sets of chromosomes
__label__1 in each somatic cell of the organism  all cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells   the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome  called homologous chromosomes
__label__0 somatic cells are sometimes referred to as  body  cells
__label__0 because the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis  the same stage names are assigned
__label__0 however  because there are two rounds of division  the major process and the stages are designated with a  i  or a  ii
__label__1 thus  meiosis i is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase i  prometaphase i  and so on
__label__1 meiosis ii  in which the second round of meiotic division takes place  includes prophase ii  prometaphase ii  and so on
__label__0 in mitosis  homologous chromosomes line up end  to  end so that when they divide  each daughter cell receives a sister chromatid from both members of the homologous pair
__label__1 the synaptonemal complex  a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes  first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes
__label__1 the tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis
__label__0 located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules
__label__1 these assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover  or genetic recombination  between the non  sister chromatids
__label__0 in some species  cells enter a brief interphase  or interkinesis  before entering meiosis ii
__label__0 interkinesis lacks an s phase  so chromosomes are not duplicated
__label__1 fertilization  the joining of two haploid gametes  restores the diploid condition
__label__1 there are three main categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms  diploid  dominant  in which the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life stage  such as with most animals including humans  haploid  dominant  in which the multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage  such as with all fungi and some algae  and alternation of generations  in which the two stages are apparent to different degrees depending on the group  as with plants and some algae
__label__1 fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote
__label__1 the zygote will undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular plant called a sporophyte
__label__0 specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores
__label__0 offspring appear to be a  blend  of their parents  traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation
__label__1 the blending theory of inheritance asserted that the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring  but we now know that this is not the case
__label__0 mendel was the first researcher to see it
__label__1 plants used in first  generation crosses were called p  or parental generation one  plants   link
__label__0 mendel collected the seeds belonging to the p plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season
__label__0 in his  publication  mendel reported the results of his crosses involving seven different characteristics  each with two contrasting traits
__label__1 a trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic
__label__0 the characteristics included plant height  seed texture  seed color  flower color  pea pod size  pea pod color  and flower position
__label__1 dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization
__label__1 recessive traits become latent  or disappear  in the offspring of a hybridization
__label__0 the recessive trait does  however  reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring
__label__0 for cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic  a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not encode the same version of that characteristic
__label__1 gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called alleles
__label__0 mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms  but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population
__label__0 the p plants that mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying
__label__0 diploid organisms that are homozygous at a given gene  or locus  have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes
__label__0 mendel s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait
__label__0 the dominant seed color is yellow  therefore  the parental genotypes were yy for the plants with yellow seeds and yy for the plants with green seeds  respectively
__label__1 a punnett square  devised by the british geneticist reginald punnett  can be drawn that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies
__label__0 to prepare a punnett square  all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the top  for one parent  and side  for the other parent  of a grid  representing their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes
__label__0 note that different genotypic abbreviations are used for mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns from simple dominance and recessiveness
__label__1 this pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance  denoting the expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an intermediate phenotype
__label__0 the allele for red flowers is incompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers
__label__0 note that when many alleles exist for the same gene  the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type  often abbreviated      this is considered the standard or norm
__label__1 all other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard  meaning that they deviate from the wild type
__label__0 the variant may be recessive or dominant to the wild  type allele
__label__0 because of the location of the eye  color gene  reciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios
__label__1 males are said to be hemizygous  because they have only one allele for any x  linked characteristic
__label__0 hemizygosity makes the descriptions of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant for xy males
__label__1 mendel s law of dominance states that in a heterozygote  one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic
__label__0 rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype  the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively
__label__1 mendel s law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes  and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur
__label__1 the independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross  a cross between two true  breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics
__label__0 consider the characteristics of seed color and seed texture for two pea plants  one that has green  wrinkled seeds  yyrr  and another that has yellow  round seeds  yyrr
__label__0 that same year  walter sutton observed the separation of chromosomes into daughter cells during meiosis   link
__label__1 together  these observations led to the development of the chromosomal theory of inheritance  which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for mendelian inheritance
__label__0 because they correspond to new allele combinations  the genotypes ab and ab are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis
__label__1 parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents
__label__0 morgan and his colleagues  however  found that when such heterozygous individuals were test crossed to a homozygous recessive parent  aabb  aabb   both parental and nonparental cases occurred
__label__0 the isolation and microscopic observation of chromosomes forms the basis of cytogenetics and is the primary method by which clinicians detect chromosomal abnormalities in humans
__label__1 a karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes  and includes their length  banding pattern  and centromere position
__label__1 to obtain a view of an individual s karyotype  cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart  or karyogram  also known as an ideogram   link
__label__1 for instance  jacobsen syndrome  which involves distinctive facial features as well as heart and bleeding defects  is identified by a deletion on chromosome
__label__1 finally  the karyotype can pinpoint translocations  which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another chromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome
__label__0 translocations are implicated in certain cancers  including chronic myelogenous leukemia
__label__1 an individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid  in humans  euploidy corresponds to  pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes
__label__1 an individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid  a term that includes monosomy  loss of one chromosome  or trisomy  gain of an extraneous chromosome
__label__0 monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they lack essential genes
__label__1 a chromosome inversion is the detachment    rotation  and reinsertion of part of a chromosome
__label__1 inversions may occur in nature as a result of mechanical shear  or from the action of transposable elements  special dna sequences capable of facilitating the rearrangement of chromosome segments with the help of enzymes that cut and paste dna sequences
__label__0 a half century later  british bacteriologist frederick griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another  horizontally   rather than by descent
__label__1 in   he reported the first demonstration of bacterial transformation  a process in which external dna is taken up by a cell  thereby changing morphology and physiology
__label__1 he was working with streptococcus pneumoniae  the bacterium that causes pneumonia
__label__0 atp hydrolysis is required for this process
__label__0 as the dna opens up  y  shaped structures called replication forks are formed
__label__0 two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi directionally as replication proceeds
__label__1 another enzyme  rna primase  synthesizes an rna primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the dna
__label__0 because this sequence primes the dna synthesis  it is appropriately called the primer
__label__0 dna polymerase can now extend this rna primer  adding nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand   link
__label__0 okazaki fragments are named after the japanese scientist who first discovered them
__label__1 the strand with the okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand
__label__0 the primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of dna pol i  and the gaps are filled in by deoxyribonucleotides
__label__1 the nicks that remain between the newly synthesized dna  that replaced the rna primer  and the previously synthesized dna are sealed by the enzyme dna ligase that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkage between the oh end of one nucleotide and the   phosphate end of the other fragment
__label__1 in another type of repair mechanism  nucleotide excision repair  enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both the   and   ends of the incorrect base   link
__label__0 the segment of dna is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides by the action of dna pol
__label__1 induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals  uv rays  x  rays  or some other environmental agent
__label__1 spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent  they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body
__label__0 these can be of two types  either transitions or transversions
__label__1 transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind  for example  a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine
__label__1 transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine  or vice versa  for example  cytosine  a pyrimidine  is replaced by adenine  a purine
__label__0 the discovery of the enzyme telomerase   link   helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained
__label__1 the telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built  in rna template
__label__0 it attaches to the end of the chromosome  and complementary bases to the rna template are added on the   end of the dna strand
__label__0 in contrast  there are  possible nucleotide triplets     which is far more than the number of amino acids
__label__0 scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was degenerate
__label__0 in other words  a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet
__label__1 in addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain  three of the  codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery
__label__0 these triplets are called nonsense codons  or stop codons
__label__0 another codon  aug  also has a special function
__label__1 the region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble
__label__1 transcription always proceeds from the same dna strand for each gene  which is called the template strand
__label__0 the mrna product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other dna strand  called the nontemplate strand
__label__0 the only difference is that in mrna  all of the t nucleotides are replaced with u nucleotides
__label__0 nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream
__label__1 conversely  nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with    numbering and are called downstream nucleotides
__label__1 a promoter is a dna sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription
__label__0 in most cases  promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate
__label__0 rho  independent termination is controlled by specific sequences in the dna template strand
__label__0 as the polymerase nears the end of the gene being transcribed  it encounters a region rich in c  g nucleotides
__label__0 these pseudogenes are copied from mrna and incorporated into the chromosome
__label__0 for example  the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved caat box  ggccaatct  at approximately
__label__0 this sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors
__label__0 for polynucleotide synthesis to occur  the transcription machinery needs to move histones out of the way every time it encounters a nucleosome
__label__1 this is accomplished by a special protein complex called fact  which stands for  facilitates chromatin transcription   this complex pulls histones away from the dna template as the polymerase moves along it
__label__0 once the pre  mrna is synthesized  the fact complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes
__label__0 
__label__1 the initiator trna interacts with the start codon aug  or rarely  gug   links to a formylated methionine called fmet  and can also bind if
__label__0 formylated methionine is inserted by
__label__1 peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the a  site trna and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the p  site trna
__label__1 the formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase  an rna  based enzyme that is integrated into the s ribosomal subunit
__label__0 the energy for each peptide bond formation is derived from gtp hydrolysis  which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor
__label__0 while the pre  mrna is still being synthesized  a methylguanosine cap is added to the   end of the growing transcript by a phosphate linkage
__label__1 this moiety  functional group  protects the nascent mrna from degradation
__label__0 if the process errs by even a single nucleotide  the reading frame of the rejoined exons would shift  and the resulting protein would be dysfunctional
__label__1 the process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called splicing   link
__label__0 introns are removed and degraded while the pre  mrna is still in the nucleus
__label__0 the regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process   link
__label__1 regulation may occur when the dna is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors  epigenetic level   when the rna is transcribed  transcriptional level   when the rna is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed  post  transcriptional level   when the rna is translated into protein  translational level   or after the protein has been made  post  translational level
__label__0 coli need amino acids to survive
__label__0 tryptophan is one such amino acid that e coli can ingest from the environment
__label__0 a dna sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the promoter region and the first trp coding gene
__label__1 this operator contains the dna code to which the repressor protein can bind
__label__0 when tryptophan is present in the cell  two tryptophan molecules bind to the trp repressor  which changes shape to bind to the trp operator
__label__0 coli
__label__1 when glucose levels decline in the cell  accumulating camp binds to the positive regulator catabolite activator protein  cap   a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control the processing of alternative sugars
__label__0 when camp binds to cap  the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources   link
__label__0 if a gene is to be transcribed  the histone proteins and dna are modified surrounding the chromosomal region encoding that gene
__label__0 this opens the chromosomal region to allow access for rna polymerase and other proteins  called transcription factors  to bind to the promoter region  located just upstream of the gene  and initiate transcription
__label__0 if a gene is to remain turned off  or silenced  the histone proteins and dna have different modifications that signal a closed chromosomal configuration
__label__1 in some eukaryotic genes  there are regions that help increase or enhance transcription
__label__0 these regions  called enhancers  are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance
__label__0 they can be located upstream of a gene  within the coding region of the gene  downstream of a gene  or may be thousands of nucleotides away
__label__0 if the rna is stable  it will be detected for longer periods of time in the cytoplasm  binding of proteins to the rna can influence its stability
__label__1 proteins  called rna  binding proteins  or rbps  can bind to the regions of the rna just upstream or downstream of the protein  coding region
__label__1 these regions in the rna that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated regions  or utrs
__label__0 in addition to rbps that bind to and control  increase or decrease  rna stability  other elements called micrornas can bind to the rna molecule
__label__1 these micrornas  or mirnas  are short rna molecules that are only    nucleotides in length
__label__0 the mirnas are made in the nucleus as longer pre  mirnas
__label__0 like transcription  translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate the process
__label__1 in translation  the complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex
__label__1 the first protein to bind to the rna to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor  eif
__label__0 the eif protein is active when it binds to the high  energy molecule guanosine triphosphate  gtp
__label__1 gtp provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate  gdp
__label__0 the eif protein bound to gtp binds to the small s ribosomal subunit
__label__1 ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is complete
__label__1 these proteins are moved to the proteasome  an organelle that functions to remove proteins  to be degraded   link
__label__0 one way to control gene expression  therefore  is to alter the longevity of the protein
__label__1 biotechnology is the use of biological agents for technological advancement
__label__0 biotechnology was used for breeding livestock and crops long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood
__label__0 because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic ph in an aqueous environment  they can be mobilized by an electric field
__label__1 gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of size  using this charge
__label__0 the nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments
__label__0 gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size
__label__1 the fragments in the gel are then transferred onto a nylon membrane in a procedure called blotting   link
__label__0 the nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences
__label__1 plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations  such as escherichia coli  and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism  such as antibiotic resistance  the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics
__label__0 plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large  scale production of important reagents  such as insulin and human growth hormone
__label__1 plasmids with foreign dna inserted into them are called recombinant dna molecules because they are created artificially and do not occur in nature
__label__0 they are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis
__label__1 reproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism
__label__1 most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means  which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals  parents   making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent
__label__1 the organism that receives the recombinant dna is called a genetically modified organism  gmo
__label__1 if the foreign dna that is introduced comes from a different species  the host organism is called transgenic
__label__0 bacteria  plants  and animals have been genetically modified since the early s for academic  medical  agricultural  and industrial purposes
__label__1 gene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease
__label__0 in its simplest form  it involves the introduction of a good gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene
__label__1 genomics is the study of entire genomes  including the complete set of genes  their nucleotide sequence and organization  and their interactions within a species and with other species
__label__1 genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome
__label__0 the maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets
__label__0 physical maps present the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes  similar to a detailed road map
__label__1 a physical map is a representation of the physical distance  in nucleotides  between genes or genetic markers
__label__0 both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome
__label__0 some genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms  rflp   variable number of tandem repeats  vntrs   microsatellite polymorphisms  and the single nucleotide polymorphisms  snps
__label__1 rflps  sometimes pronounced  rif  lips   are detected when the dna of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease that recognizes specific sequences in the dna to generate a series of dna fragments  which are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis
__label__0 this technique overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping and is not affected by increased or decreased recombination frequency
__label__1 sequence mapping resulted from dna sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs
__label__1 the creation of genomic libraries and complementary dna  cdna  libraries  collections of cloned sequences or all dna from a genome  has sped up the process of physical mapping
__label__0 although there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years  doctors are still confounded by some diseases  and they are using whole  genome sequencing to get to the bottom of the problem
__label__1 whole  genome sequencing is a process that determines the dna sequence of an entire genome
__label__0 profits  in turn  are also determined by the price of the outputs the firm sells and by the price of the inputs  like labor or raw materials  the firm needs to buy
__label__1 aggregate supply  as  refers to the total quantity of output  ie
__label__1 real gdp  firms will produce and sell
__label__0 when an economy is operating at its potential gdp  machines and factories are running at capacity  and the unemployment rate is relatively low  at the natural rate of unemployment
__label__0 for this reason  potential gdp is sometimes also called full  employment gdp
__label__0 the foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the united states while remaining fixed in other countries  then goods in the united states will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of the world
__label__0 us exports will be relatively more expensive  and the quantity of exports sold will fall
__label__0 us imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper  so the quantity of imports will rise
__label__0 for this reason  what we have been calling the as curve  will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply  sras  curve
__label__0 the vertical line at potential gdp may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply  lras  curve
__label__0 for example  the us economy experienced recessions in               and    that were each preceded or accompanied by a rise in the key input of oil prices
__label__0 in the s  this pattern of a shift to the left in sras leading to a stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamed stagflation
__label__0 conversely  a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the sras curve to the right  providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs
__label__0 from  to   for example  the average price of crude oil fell by almost half  from   a barrel to   a barrel
__label__0 if changes of a few percentage points of gdp seem small to you  remember that since gdp was about   trillion in   a seemingly small change of   of gdp is equal to close to   billion  tax policy can affect consumption and investment spending  too
__label__0 tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase consumption demand  while tax increases will tend to diminish it
__label__0 tax policy can also pump up investment demand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment
__label__0 two types of unemployment were described in the unemployment chapter
__label__1 cyclical unemployment bounces up and down according to the short  run movements of gdp
__label__0 over the long run  in the united states  the unemployment rate typically hovers around    give or take one percentage point or so   when the economy is healthy
__label__1 focus first on the keynesian zone  that portion of the sras curve on the far left which is relatively flat
__label__0 if the ad curve crosses this portion of the sras curve at an equilibrium point like ek  then certain statements about the economic situation will follow
__label__0 the idea is simple  firms produce output only if they expect it to sell
__label__1 thus  while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation s potential gdp  the amount of goods and services actually being sold  known as real gdp  depends on how much demand exists across the economy
__label__0 this point is illustrated in  link
__label__0 the keynesian ad  as modelthe keynesian view of the ad  as model uses an sras curve  which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output
__label__0 as a consequence  the economy experiences inflation
__label__1 the key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap  increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match potential output  recall from the aggregate supply  aggregate demand model that aggregate demand is total spending  economy  wide  on domestic goods and services
__label__0 aggregate demand  ad  is actually what economists call total planned expenditure
__label__1 spending on new capital goods is called investment expenditure
__label__0 investment falls into four categories  producer s durable equipment and software  new nonresidential structures  such as factories  offices  and retail locations   changes in inventories  and residential structures  such as single  family homes  townhouses  and apartment buildings
__label__1 keynesian economics focuses on explaining why recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy prescription for minimizing their effects
__label__0 the keynesian view of recession is based on two key building blocks
__label__0 first  aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment
__label__1 second  frequent price changes may leave customers confused or angry  especially if they find out that a product now costs more than expected
__label__0 these costs of changing prices are called menu costs  like the costs of printing up a new set of menus with different prices in a restaurant
__label__0 prices do respond to forces of supply and demand  but from a macroeconomic perspective  the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time
__label__0 thus  when investment spending collapsed during the great depression  it caused a much larger decrease in real gdp
__label__0 the size of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in recent discussions of the effectiveness of the obama administration s fiscal stimulus package  officially titled the american recovery and reinvestment act of
__label__0 many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment and inflation
__label__0 this pattern became known as stagflation
__label__1 recall from the aggregate demand  aggregate supply model that stagflation is an unhealthy combination of high unemployment and high inflation
__label__0 he proposed that the government could bury money underground  and let mining companies get started to dig the money up again
__label__0 these suggestions were slightly tongue  in  cheek  but their purpose was to emphasize that a great depression is no time to quibble over the specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate demand by enough to lift the economy to potential gdp
__label__0 the neoclassical perspective on macroeconomics holds that  in the long run  the economy will fluctuate around its potential gdp and its natural rate of unemployment
__label__0 this chapter begins with two building blocks of neoclassical economics     the size of the economy is determined by potential gdp  and    wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential gdp level of output
__label__0 actual or real gdp is benchmarked against the potential gdp to determine how well the economy is performing
__label__0 growth in gdp can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology
__label__0 neoclassical economists who focus on potential gdp as the primary determinant of real gdp argue that the long  run aggregate supply curve is located at potential gdp  that is  the long  run aggregate supply curve is a vertical line drawn at the level of potential gdp  as shown in  link
__label__0 a vertical lras curve means that the level of aggregate supply  or potential gdp  will determine the real gdp of the economy  regardless of the level of aggregate demand
__label__0 over time  increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital  increases in human capital  and technological advancements shift potential gdp and the vertical lras curve gradually to the right
__label__0 after all  many people and firms are not especially well informed  either about what is happening in the economy or about how the economy works
__label__1 an alternate assumption is that people and firms act with adaptive expectations  they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change  but are not perfect synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory
__label__0 if most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations  then the adjustment from the short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time  the empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear  cut
__label__0 the keynesian perspective introduced the phillips curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate supply curve
__label__0 the short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping phillips curve  thus  there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run
__label__0 neoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment  after all  if economic output is determined by a vertical aggregate supply curve  then aggregate demand has no long  run effect on unemployment
__label__0 instead  neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right  keeping the price level much the same and inflationary pressures low
__label__0 however  the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why unemployment moves up and down over short time horizons of a few years
__label__0 nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful when the economy is mired in an especially deep and long  lasting recession  like the great depression of the s
__label__0 keynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment  neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower unemployment
__label__0 at this point  you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from welcome to economics
__label__0 economic growth  low unemployment  and low inflation
__label__0 we have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals
__label__0 you should also understand keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand  aggregate supply  ad  as  model
__label__1 with the goals and frameworks for macroeconomic analysis in mind  the final step is to discuss the two main categories of macroeconomic policy  monetary policy  which focuses on money  banking and interest rates  and fiscal policy  which focuses on government spending  taxes  and borrowing
__label__0 we will get to its definition soon
__label__0 first  money serves as a medium of exchange  which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller
__label__0 instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes  the accountant now exchanges accounting services for money
__label__0 finally  another function of money is that money must serve as a standard of deferred payment
__label__1 this means that if money is usable today to make purchases  it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in the future
__label__0 of course  gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in the creation of jewelry
__label__0 as commodity money  gold has historically served its purpose as a medium of exchange  a store of value  and as a unit of account
__label__1 commodity  backed currencies are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or other commodity held at a bank
__label__0 during much of its history  the money supply in the united states was backed by gold and silver
__label__0 
__label__0 less liquid
__label__1 the federal reserve bank  which is the central bank of the united states  is a bank regulator and is responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity
__label__0 there are two definitions of money  m and m money supply
__label__0 a broader definition of money  m includes everything in m but also adds other types of deposits
__label__1 for example  m includes savings deposits in banks  which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly  but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank
__label__0 many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds  where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way  such as short  term government bonds
__label__0 where does  plastic money  like debit cards  credit cards  and smart money fit into this picture
__label__1 a debit card  like a check  is an instruction to the user s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller
__label__0 it is important to note that in our definition of money  it ischeckable deposits that are money  not the paper check or the debit card
__label__0 one key message underlying this discussion of m and m is that money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins  instead  money is closely linked to bank accounts
__label__0 indeed  the macroeconomic policies concerning money are largely conducted through the banking system
__label__0 the next section explains how banks function and how a nation s banking system has the power to create money
__label__1 banks as financial intermediariesan  intermediary  is one who stands between two other parties
__label__1 banks are a financial intermediary  that is  an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank
__label__0 financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds  but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions  which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans
__label__1 a bank s balance sheeta balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities
__label__1 an asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something
__label__0 in this case  a home is the asset  but the mortgage is the liability
__label__1 the net worth is the asset value minus how much is owed  the liability
__label__1 the net worth is the asset value minus how much is owed  the liability
__label__0 a bank s balance sheet operates in much the same way
__label__0 many banks issue home loans  and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so  but then sell the loans to other banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments
__label__1 the market where loans are made to borrowers is called the primary loan market  while the market in which these loans are bought and sold by financial institutions is the secondary loan market
__label__1 one key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan  when they buy it in the secondary loan market  is the perceived riskiness of the loan  that is  given the characteristics of the borrower  such as income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly  what proportion of loans of this type will be repaid
__label__0 the greater the risk that a loan will not be repaid  the less that any financial institution will pay to acquire the loan
__label__0 securitization offers certain advantages
__label__0 if a bank makes most of its loans in a local area  then the bank may be financially vulnerable if the local economy declines  so that many people are unable to make their payments
__label__0 clearly  the bank can not survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers
__label__0 how can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an asset  liability time mismatch
__label__1 one strategy is for a bank to diversify its loans  which means lending to a variety of customers
__label__0 for example  suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market  say  making a high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area
__label__1 the organization responsible for conducting monetary policy and ensuring that a nation s financial system operates smoothly is called the central bank
__label__0 most nations have central banks or currency boards
__label__0 a safe and stable national financial system is a critical concern of the federal reserve
__label__0 the goal is not only to protect individuals  savings  but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself
__label__0 banks are allowed to make loans to businesses  individuals  and other banks
__label__0 they are allowed to purchase us treasury securities but  to protect depositors  they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky
__label__1 bank capital is the difference between a bank s assets and its liabilities
__label__0 in other words  it is a bank s net worth
__label__0 the practical question is that measuring the value of a bank s assets is not always straightforward
__label__1 as discussed in money and banking  a bank s assets are its loans  and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that these loans will not be repaid
__label__0 these issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries  or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan
__label__0 the political question arises because the decision by a bank supervisor to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is often controversial  and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure from the owners of the bank and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off
__label__0 about  countries around the world  including all of the major economies  have deposit insurance programs
__label__1 in the united states  the federal deposit insurance corporation  fdic  is responsible for deposit insurance
__label__0 banks pay an insurance premium to the fdic
__label__0 the most commonly used tool of monetary policy in the us is open market operations
__label__1 open market operations take place when the central bank sells or buys us treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates
__label__1 a second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement  which  as we noted earlier  is the percentage of each bank s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank
__label__0 if banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves  they have less money available to lend out
__label__1 a monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy
__label__1 conversely  a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy
__label__0 of course  financial markets display a wide range of interest rates  representing borrowers with different risk premiums and loans that are to be repaid over different periods of time
__label__0 in general  when the federal funds rate drops substantially  other interest rates drop  too  and when the federal funds rate rises  other interest rates rise
__label__0 in  link   b   the original equilibrium  e  occurs at an output of   which is above potential gdp
__label__1 a contractionary monetary policy will raise interest rates  discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending  and cause the original demand curve  ad  to shift left to ad  so that the new equilibrium  e  occurs at the potential gdp level of these examples suggest that monetary policy should be countercyclical  that is  it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings
__label__0 monetary policy should be loosened when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tightened when inflation threatens
__label__0 with the recession still ongoing  the fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing  qe
__label__1 this is the purchase of long  term government and private mortgage  backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand
__label__0 banks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves  but no rule prohibits them from holding additional excess reserves above the legally mandated limit
__label__0 for example  during a recession banks may be hesitant to lend  because they fear that when the economy is contracting  a high proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their loans
__label__1 unpredictable movements of velocityvelocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates through the economy
__label__0 the velocity of money in a year is defined as
__label__1 remember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation
__label__0 if the nominal interest rate is   and the rate of inflation is    then the borrower is effectively paying a   real interest rate
__label__0 if the nominal interest rate is   and there is deflation of    then the real interest rate is actually
__label__0 so far at least  it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific up  and  down fluctuations in m
__label__0 given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic banking  m is now favored as a measure of money rather than the narrower m
__label__0 in the neoclassical model  the level of potential gdp  and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential gdp  is determined by real economic factors
__label__0 if the original level of aggregate demand is ad  then an expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to ad only creates an inflationary increase in the price level  but it does not alter gdp or unemployment
__label__0 from this perspective  all that monetary policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation  and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing economy
__label__0 instead  the law governing the federal reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account
__label__0 economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion
__label__0 for those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy  the fear is that politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy  even if the economy is already producing at potential gdp
__label__0 in some countries  the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures  with the result of higher inflation  but no long  term reduction in unemployment
__label__1 at a broader level  some economists worry about a leverage cycle  where  leverage  is a term used by financial economists to mean  borrowing
__label__0 when economic times are good  banks and the financial sector are eager to lend  and people and firms are eager to borrow
__label__1 remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier  a process of loans being made  money being deposited  and more loans being made
__label__0 this chapter discusses the international dimension of money  which involves conversions from one currency to another at an exchange rate
__label__1 an exchange rate is nothing more than a price  that is  the price of one currency in terms of another currency  and so they can be analyzed with the tools of supply and demand
__label__0 the first module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign exchange markets  their size  their main participants  and the vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates
__label__0 you have encountered the basic concept of exchange rates in earlier chapters
__label__0 in the international trade and capital flows  for example  we discussed how exchange rates are used to compare gdp statistics from countries where gdp is measured in different currencies
__label__0 these earlier examples  however  took the actual exchange rate as given  as if it were a fact of nature
__label__1 the other kind of international financial investment  portfolio investment  involves a purely financial investment that does not entail any management responsibility
__label__0 an example would be a us financial investor who purchased bonds issued by the government of the united kingdom  or deposited money in a british bank
__label__0 these banks  and a few other firms   known as dealers  then trade the foreign exchange
__label__0 this is called the interbank market
__label__0 the horizontal axis shows the quantity of mexican pesos traded in the foreign exchange market
__label__0 the demand curve  d  for mexican pesos intersects with the supply curve  s  of mexican pesos at the equilibrium point  e   which is an exchange rate of  cents in us currency for each mexican peso and a total volume of  billion pesos
__label__0 note that the two exchange rates are inverses   pesos per dollar is the same as  cents per peso  or   per peso
__label__0 if the price of cars was much higher than   in this example  then at least some canadian buyers would convert their canadian dollars to us dollars and go to the united states to purchase their cars
__label__1 this is known as arbitrage  the process of buying and selling goods or currencies across international borders at a profit
__label__0 it may occur slowly  but over time  it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of internationally traded goods is similar in all countries
__label__0 a central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons     movements in the exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy     frequent substantial fluctuations in the exchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a nation s banking system  this may contribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital  which can set the economy up for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another country
__label__0 let s discuss these scenarios in turn
__label__0 exchange rates  aggregate demand  and aggregate supply
__label__0 in     countries across eastern asia  like thailand  korea  malaysia  and indonesia  experienced a sharp depreciation of their currencies  in some cases   or more
__label__0 these countries had been experiencing substantial inflows of foreign investment capital  with bank lending increasing by   to   per year through the mid s
__label__0 when their exchange rates depreciated  the banking systems in these countries were bankrupt
__label__1 a policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates is referred to as a floating exchange rate
__label__0 the us dollar is a floating exchange rate  as are the currencies of about   of the countries in the world economy
__label__1 when a government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the exchange rate of its currency is different from what the market would have produced  it is said to have established a  peg  for its currency
__label__1 a soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market  but in some cases  especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction  the central bank will intervene in the market
__label__1 with a hard peg exchange rate policy  the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate
__label__0 the central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals  use the reals to purchase foreign currencies  and avoid selling any of its own currency
__label__0 in this way  it can fill the gap between quantity demanded and quantity supplied of its currency
__label__0 for example  when a country pegs its exchange rate  it will sometimes face economic situations where it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession  but it can not do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg
__label__0 with a soft peg exchange rate policy  the central bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession  but in other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate
__label__0 with a hard peg policy  domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment  but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg
__label__0 thus  even though the goal of a soft peg policy is to reduce short  term fluctuations of the exchange rate  the existence of the policy  when anticipated in the foreign exchange market  may sometimes increase short  term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act
__label__0 the following clear it up feature discusses the effects of international capital flows  capital that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or direct investment
__label__0 but proposals to limit international financial flows have severe practical difficulties
__label__0 taxes are imposed by national governments  not international ones
__label__0 in this chapter  we revisit fiscal policy  which was first covered in welcome to economics
__label__0 fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy  the other is monetary policy
__label__0 while monetary policy is made by policymakers at the federal reserve  fiscal policy is made by congress and the president  the discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand
__label__1 when the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year  it runs a budget deficit
__label__1 conversely  when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year  it runs a budget surplus
__label__1 if government spending and taxes are equal  it is said to have a balanced budget
__label__0 when most people think of taxes levied by the federal government  the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on april   or the first business day after
__label__0 the personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue  but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue
__label__0 the second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax  captured in social insurance and retirement receipts   which provides funds for social security and medicare
__label__0 payroll taxes have increased steadily over time
__label__1 the medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax  that is  a flat percentage of all wages earned
__label__1 the social security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit  but above that level it becomes a regressive tax  meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax
__label__0 the federal government has a few other  smaller sources of revenue
__label__1 it imposes an excise tax  that is  a tax on a particular good  on gasoline  tobacco  and alcohol
__label__0 as a share of gdp  the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time  from about   of gdp in the s to roughly   by   according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office
__label__0 another useful way to view the budget deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual deficits
__label__1 the national debt refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time  in contrast  the budget deficit refers to how much has been borrowed in one particular year
__label__0 link  shows the ratio of debt  gdp since
__label__0 the millions of unemployed in    could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of their salaries
__label__1 federal fiscal policies include discretionary fiscal policy  when the government passes a new law that explicitly changes tax or spending levels
__label__0 the stimulus package of  is an example
__label__0 in the early s  many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle  and the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation  were a thing of the past
__label__0 on the cover of its december     issue  time magazine  then the premier news magazine in the united states  ran a picture of john maynard keynes  and the story inside identified keynesian theories as  the prime influence on the world s economies
__label__0 the article reported that policymakers have  used keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent  business  cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices
__label__0 this happy consensus  however  did not last
__label__0 the us economy suffered one recession from december  to november   a deeper recession from november  to march   and then double  dip recessions from january to june  and from july  to november
__label__0 it often takes some months before the economic statistics signal clearly that a downturn has started  and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a recession and not just a one or two  month blip
__label__1 the time it takes to determine that a recession has occurred is often called the recognition lag
__label__0 after this lag  policymakers become aware of the problem and propose fiscal policy bills
__label__0 most economists view the proposals for a perpetually balanced budget with bemusement
__label__0 after all  in the short term  economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to fluctuate up and down with the economy and the automatic stabilizers
__label__0 the national saving and investment identity  first introduced in the international trade and capital flows chapter  provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in financial capital markets
__label__0 the identity begins with a statement that must always hold true  the quantity of financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded
__label__0 the us economy has two main sources for financial capital  private savings from inside the us economy and public savings
__label__1 total savings  private savings  s   public savings  t  g
__label__0 total savings  private savings  s   public savings  t  g
__label__0 these include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad
__label__0 if private saving and the trade balance remain the same  then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital
__label__1 when government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital  the result is known as crowding out
__label__0 to understand the potential impact of crowding out  consider the situation of the us economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late
__label__0 in   for example  the budget deficit was roughly   of gdp
__label__0 imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits  causing a rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment
__label__0 if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential gdp  threatening an inflationary increase in price levels  the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy
__label__0 in this situation  the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy  and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment
__label__0 on the other hand  if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential gdp  an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy
__label__0 not all spending on educational human capital needs to happen through the government  many college students in the united states pay a substantial share of the cost of their education
__label__0 if low  income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade  school children  government spending seems likely to play a substantial role
__label__0 exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits
__label__0 link  shows a situation using the exchange rate for the us dollar  measured in euros
__label__0 at the original equilibrium  e   where the demand for us dollars  d  intersects with the supply of us dollars  s  on the foreign exchange market  the exchange rate is  euros per us dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is   billion per day  which was roughly the quantity of dollar  euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid s
__label__0 you will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations
__label__0 as explained in the macroeconomic perspective  we must consider using purchasing power parity or  international dollars  to convert average incomes into comparable units
__label__0 purchasing power parity  as formally defined in exchange rates and international capital flows  takes into account the fact that prices of the same good are different across countries
__label__0 the macroeconomic perspective explained how to measure gdp  the challenges of using gdp to compare standards of living  and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution
__label__0 where does economic growth come from
__label__0 according to most economists who believe in the growth consensus  economic growth  as discussed in economic growth  is built on a foundation of productivity improvements
__label__0 in turn  productivity increases are the result of greater human and physical capital and technology  all interacting in a market  driven economy
__label__0 lack of saving means a lack of capital accumulation and a lack of loanable funds for investment in physical and human capital
__label__0 recent research by two mit economists  abhijit bannerjee and esther duflo  has confirmed that the households in these economies are trapped in low incomes because they can not muster enough investment to push themselves out of poverty
__label__0 for example  the average citizen of burundi  the lowest  income country  subsists on   per year  adjusted to  dollars
__label__0 according to data collected by the central intelligence agency in its cia factbook  as of     of burundi s population is agrarian  with coffee and tea as the main income producing crop
__label__0 the monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward  run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans  drive down interest rates  and increase aggregate demand
__label__0 in a recession  there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off  and so even a central bank  with fighting inflation as its top priority  can usually justify some reduction in interest rates
__label__0 with regard to fiscal policy  the automatic stabilizers discussed in government budgets and fiscal policy should be allowed to work  even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession
__label__0 there is less agreement over whether  in addition to automatic stabilizers  governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases
__label__0 policymakers of the high  income economies appear to have learned some lessons about fighting inflation
__label__0 first  whatever happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run  monetary policy can be used to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term
__label__0 there is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services  fear of job loss  environmental dangers  unfair labor practices  and many other concerns
__label__1 these arguments are discussed at some length in the international trade and capital flows  of all of the arguments for limitations on trade  perhaps the most controversial one among economists is the infant industry argument  that is  subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become established
__label__0 globalization and protectionism explains this concept in more detail
__label__0 instead of offering net financial investment abroad  the us economy is soaking up savings from all over the world
__label__0 these substantial us trade deficits may not be sustainable according to sebastian edwards writing for the national bureau of economic research
__label__0 while trade deficits on their own are not bad  the question is whether they will be reduced gradually or hastily
__label__0 the first wave of globalization started in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of world war i
__label__0 over that time  global exports as a share of global gdp rose from less than   of gdp in  to   of gdp in
__label__1 a country has an absolute advantage in producing a good over another country if it uses fewer resources to produce that good
__label__0 absolute advantage can be the result of a country s natural endowment
__label__0 to simplify  let s say that saudi arabia and the united states each have  worker hours  see  link
__label__0 we illustrate what each country is capable of producing on its own using a production possibility frontier  ppf  graph  shown in  link
__label__0 recall from choice in a world of scarcity that the production possibilities frontier shows the maximum amount that each country can produce given its limited resources  in this case workers  and its level of technology
__label__0 absolute advantage simply compares the productivity of a worker between countries
__label__0 it answers the question   how many inputs do i need to produce shoes in mexico
__label__0 comparative advantage asks this same question slightly differently
__label__1 moreover  the theory of comparative advantage suggests that each economy should specialize to a degree in certain products  and then exchange those products
__label__1 a high proportion of trade  however  is intra  industry trade  that is  trade of goods within the same industry from one country to another
__label__0 for example  the united states produces and exports autos and imports autos
__label__0 in fact  recent years have seen a trend in international trade called splitting up the value chain
__label__0 the value chain describes how a good is produced in stages
__label__0 as indicated in the beginning of the chapter  the production of the iphone involves the design and engineering of the phone in the united states  parts supplied from korea  the assembly of the parts in china  and the advertising and marketing done in the united states
__label__1 tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons
__label__0 some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries  for humanitarian reasons  and protecting against dumping
__label__1 when a government legislates policies to reduce or block international trade it is engaging in protectionism
__label__0 protectionist policies often seek to shield domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign competition
__label__1 nontariff barriers are all the other ways that a nation can draw up rules  regulations  inspections  and paperwork to make it more costly or difficult to import products
__label__0 a rule requiring certain safety standards can limit imports just as effectively as high tariffs or low import quotas  for instance
__label__0 the extra  tons of sugar production  shown by the horizontal gap between the demand curve and the supply curve in brazil  is exported to the united states
__label__1 to build a useful macroeconomic model  we need a model that shows what determines total supply or total demand for the economy  and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level
__label__0 this model is called the aggregate demand  aggregate supply model
__label__0 this module will explain aggregate supply  aggregate demand  and the equilibrium between them
__label__0 if firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising  but their costs of production are not rising  then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand production  the slope of an as curve changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right
__label__1 at the far left of the aggregate supply curve  the level of output in the economy is far below potential gdp  which is defined as the quantity that an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor  physical capital  and technology  in the context of its existing market and legal institutions
__label__0 at these relatively low levels of output  levels of unemployment are high  and many factories are running only part  time  or have closed their doors
__label__1 this demand is determined by a number of factors  but one of them is the price level  recall though  that the price level is an index number such as the gdp deflator that measures the average price of the things we buy
__label__1 the aggregate demand  ad  curve shows the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level
__label__0 link  presents an aggregate demand  ad  curve
__label__0 just like the aggregate supply curve  the horizontal axis shows real gdp and the vertical axis shows the price level
__label__0 in the long run  however  producers are limited to producing at potential gdp
__label__0 for this reason  what we have been calling the as curve  will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply  sras  curve
__label__0 the vertical line at potential gdp may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply  lras  curve
__label__1 productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor
__label__0 one measure of this is output per worker or gdp per capita
__label__0 over time  productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output
__label__0 the university of michigan publishes a survey of consumer confidence and constructs an index of consumer confidence each month
__label__0 the survey results are then reported at httpwwwscaisrumichedu  which break down the change in consumer confidence among different income levels
__label__0 the ad  as model can be used to illustrate both say s law that supply creates its own demand and keynes  law that demand creates its own supply
__label__0 consider the three zones of the sras curve as identified in  link   the keynesian zone  the neoclassical zone  and the intermediate zone  keynes  neoclassical  and intermediate zones in the aggregate supply curvenear the equilibrium ek  in the keynesian zone at the far left of the sras curve  small shifts in ad  either to the right or the left  will affect the output level yk  but will not much affect the price level
__label__0 finally  consider the intermediate zone of the sras curve in  link
__label__0 if the ad curve crosses this portion of the sras curve at an equilibrium point like ei  then we might expect unemployment and inflation to move in opposing directions
__label__0 the economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment  as shown at y in the  link
__label__0 keynes believed that the economy would tend to stay in a recessionary gap  with its attendant unemployment  for a significant period of time
__label__1 in the same way  though not shown in the figure   if ad increases  the economy could experience an inflationary gap  where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output
__label__0 as a consequence  the economy experiences inflation
__label__1 disposable income  for most people  the single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is how much income they have in their take  home pay  also known as disposable income  which is income after taxes
__label__0 instead  prices and wages are  sticky   making it difficult to restore the economy to full employment and potential gdp
__label__0 keynes emphasized one particular reason why wages were sticky  the coordination argument
__label__1 this argument points out that  even if most people would be willing  at least hypothetically  to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experienced such a decline  a market  oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of coordinated wage reductions
__label__0 a key concept in keynesian economics is the expenditure multiplier
__label__1 the expenditure multiplier is the idea that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of gdp  but that spending is powerful
__label__0 the keynesian theory implied that during a recession inflationary pressures are low  but when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential gdp  the economy is at greater risk for inflation
__label__1 phillips analyzed  years of british data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and inflation  which became known as a phillips curve
__label__0 link  shows a theoretical phillips curve  and the following work it out feature shows how the pattern appears for the united states
__label__1 keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy  such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment  or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right
__label__0 for example  if aggregate demand was originally at adr in  link   so that the economy was in recession  the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the right from adr to adf  where the economy would be at potential gdp and full employment
__label__0 this focus on long  run growth rather than the short  run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long  run macroeconomic analysis and keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run
__label__0 let s consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn  and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand  aggregate supply model
__label__0 the importance of potential gdp in the long run
__label__0 one subset of neoclassical economists holds that the adjustment of wages and prices in the macroeconomy might be quite rapid indeed
__label__1 the theory of rational expectations holds that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future that they can  using all information available to them
__label__0 in an economy where most people have rational expectations  economic adjustments may happen very quickly
__label__0 as inflation fluctuates  so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods
__label__1 the nominal interest rate is comprised of the real rate  plus an expected inflation factor
__label__0 expected inflation also tells economists about how the public views the direction of the economy
__label__1 fighting unemployment or inflationas explained in unemployment  unemployment can be divided into two categories  cyclical unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment  which is the sum of frictional and structural unemployment
__label__1 cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the business cycle and is created when the economy is producing below potential gdp  giving potential employers less incentive to hire
__label__1 each approach  keynesian and neoclassical  has its strengths and weaknesses  the short  term keynesian model  built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage and price rigidity  does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls
__label__0 by focusing on the short  run adjustments of aggregate demand  keynesian economics risks overlooking the long  term causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment that exists even when the economy is producing at potential gdp
__label__0 the discussion of money and banking is a central component in the study of macroeconomics
__label__0 at this point  you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from welcome to economics
__label__0 economic growth  low unemployment  and low inflation
__label__0 we have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals  you should also understand keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand  aggregate supply  ad  as  model
__label__1 barter  literally trading one good or service for another  is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy
__label__1 in an economy without money  an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants  a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide
__label__0 for example  if an accountant wants a pair of shoes  this accountant must find someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of accounting services
__label__0 this function of money does not require that money is a perfect store of value
__label__0 in an economy with inflation  money loses some buying power each year  but it remains money  third  money serves as a unit of account  which means that it is the ruler by which other values are measured
__label__0 for example  an accountant may charge   to file your tax return
__label__0 gold  silver  cowrie shells  cigarettes  and even cocoa beans have been used as money
__label__0 although these items are used as commodity money  they also have a value from use as something other than money
__label__0 gold  for example  has been used throughout the ages as money although today it is not used as money but rather is valued for its other attributes
__label__0 rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money  economists offer broader definitions of money based on liquidity
__label__1 liquidity refers to how quickly a financial asset can be used to buy a good or service
__label__0 for example  cash is very liquid
__label__1 m money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash  checkable  demand  deposits  and traveler s checks m money supply is less liquid in nature and includes m plus savings and time deposits  certificates of deposits  and money market funds
__label__1 m money supply includes coins and currency in circulation  the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the us treasury  at the federal reserve bank  or in bank vaults
__label__0 closely related to currency are checkable deposits  also known as demand deposits
__label__1 these are the amounts held in checking accounts
__label__1 many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds  where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way  such as short  term government bonds
__label__1 another ingredient of m are the relatively small  that is  less than about    certificates of deposit  cds  or time deposits  which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time  ranging from a few months to a few years  in exchange for a higher interest rate
__label__0 in short  all these types of m are money that you can withdraw and spend  but which require a greater effort to do so than the items in m  link  should help in visualizing the relationship between m and m
__label__0 until you pay the credit card bill  you have effectively borrowed money from the credit card company
__label__0 with a smart card  you can store a certain value of money on the card and then use the card to make purchases
__label__0 some  smart cards  used for specific purposes  like long  distance phone calls or making purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria  are not really all that smart  because they can only be used for certain purchases or in certain places  in short  credit cards  debit cards  and smart cards are different ways to move money when a purchase is made
__label__0 also  those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date
__label__1 those who want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than trying to find someone to lend them cash transaction costs are the costs associated with finding a lender or a borrower for this money
__label__0 thus  banks lower transactions costs and act as financial intermediaries  they bring savers and borrowers together
__label__1 a credit union is a nonprofit financial institution that its members own and run
__label__0 members of each credit union decide who is eligible to be a member
__label__0 if you own a home  this is also considered an asset
__label__1 a liability is a debt or something you owe
__label__0 many people borrow money to buy homes
__label__0 link  illustrates a hypothetical and simplified balance sheet for the safe and secure bank
__label__0 because of the two  column format of the balance sheet  with the t  shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the horizontal line under  assets  and  liabilities   it is sometimes called a t  account
__label__0 these bonds are an asset for banks in the same way that loans are an asset  the bank will receive a stream of payments in the future
__label__0 in our example  the safe and secure bank holds bonds worth a total value of   million
__label__1 the final entry under assets is reserves  which is money that the bank keeps on hand  and that is not loaned out or invested in bonds  and thus does not lead to interest payments
__label__0 the federal reserve requires that banks keep a certain percentage of depositors  money on  reserve   which means either in their vaults or kept at the federal reserve bank
__label__0 the risk of an unexpectedly high level of loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank s liabilities  namely the deposits of its customers  can be withdrawn quickly  but many of the bank s assets like loans and bonds will only be repaid over years or even decades
__label__0 this asset  liability time mismatch  a bank s liabilities can be withdrawn in the short term while its assets are repaid in the long term  can cause severe problems for a bank
__label__0 for example  imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial amount of money at a certain interest rate  but then sees interest rates rise substantially
__label__1 in making decisions about the money supply  a central bank decides whether to raise or lower interest rates and  in this way  to influence macroeconomic policy  whose goal is low unemployment and low inflation
__label__0 the central bank is also responsible for regulating all or part of the nation s banking system to protect bank depositors and insure the health of the bank s balance sheet
__label__0 the answer is the chair of the federal reserve board of governors
__label__0 in early   janet l yellen  shown in  link  became the first woman to hold this post
__label__0 yellen has been described in the media as  perhaps the most qualified fed chair in history
__label__0 with a phd in economics from yale university  yellen has taught macroeconomics at harvard  the london school of economics  and most recently at the university of california at berkeley
__label__0 regulation falls into a number of categories  including reserve requirements  capital requirements  and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make
__label__0 in money and banking  we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum percentage of their deposits on hand as reserves
__label__0 on hand  is a bit of a misnomer because  while a portion of bank reserves are held as cash in the bank  the majority are held in the bank s account at the federal reserve  and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals by depositors
__label__1 the national credit union administration  ncua  supervises credit unions  which are nonprofit banks owned and run by their members
__label__0 there are over  credit unions in the us economy  though the typical credit union is small compared to most banks
__label__0 the federal reserve also has some responsibility for supervising financial institutions
__label__0 to protect against bank runs  congress has put two strategies into place  deposit insurance and the lender of last resort
__label__1 deposit insurance is an insurance system that makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their money  even if the bank goes bankrupt
__label__0 the most important function of the federal reserve is to conduct the nation s monetary policy
__label__0 article i  section  of the us constitution gives congress the power  to coin money  and  to regulate the value thereof
__label__0 as part of the  legislation that created the federal reserve  congress delegated these powers to the fed
__label__0 where did the federal reserve get the   million that it used to purchase the bonds
__label__0 a central bank has the power to create money
__label__0 as a result of the panic  the federal reserve was founded to be the  lender of last resort
__label__1 in the event of a bank run  sound banks   banks that were not bankrupt  could borrow as much cash as they needed from the fed s discount  window  to quell the bank run
__label__1 in the event of a bank run  sound banks   banks that were not bankrupt  could borrow as much cash as they needed from the fed s discount  window  to quell the bank run
__label__1 the interest rate banks pay for such loans is called the discount rate
__label__0 they are so named because loans are made against the bank s outstanding loans  at a discount  of their face value
__label__1 recall that the specific interest rate the fed targets is the federal funds rate
__label__0 the federal reserve has  since   established its target federal funds rate in advance of any open market operations
__label__0 link   a  illustrates this situation
__label__0 this example uses a short  run upward  sloping keynesian aggregate supply curve  sras
__label__0 the original equilibrium during a recession of e occurs at an output level of
__label__0 in late   as the us economy struggled with recession  the federal reserve had already reduced the interest rate to near  zero
__label__0 with the recession still ongoing  the fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing  qe
__label__1 this is the purchase of long  term government and private mortgage  backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand
__label__0 similarly  sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession  because they recognize that firms  sales and employees  jobs are more insecure in a recession  and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments
__label__0 the result is that during an especially deep recession  an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real gdp
__label__1 deflation occurs when the rate of inflation is negative  that is  instead of money having less purchasing power over time  as occurs with inflation  money is worth more
__label__0 deflation can make it very difficult for monetary policy to address a recession
__label__0 if velocity is constant over time  then a certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left  hand side of the basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the same percentage rise in nominal gdp  although this change could happen through an increase in inflation  or an increase in real gdp  or some combination of the two
__label__0 if velocity is changing over time but in a constant and predictable way  then changes in the money supply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal gdp
__label__0 by   central banks in  countries  including austria  brazil  canada  israel  korea  mexico  new zealand  spain  sweden  thailand  and the united kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate
__label__0 a notable exception is the federal reserve in the united states  which does not practice inflation  targeting
__label__0 instead  the law governing the federal reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account  economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion
__label__0 for example  from  to  during what was known as the  dot  com  boom  the us stock market  which is measured by the dow jones industrial index  which includes  very large companies from across the us economy   nearly tripled in value
__label__0 the nasdaq index  which includes many smaller technology companies  increased in value by a multiple of five from  to
__label__0 these rates of increase were clearly not sustainable
__label__1 the discussion in this chapter has focused on domestic monetary policy  that is  the view of monetary policy within an economy
__label__0 exchange rates and international capital flows explores the international dimension of monetary policy  and how monetary policy becomes involved with exchange rates and international flows of financial capital
__label__0 the problem of the zero percent interest rate lower bound
__label__0 with these exceptions duly noted  most of the international economy takes place in a situation of multiple national currencies in which both people and firms need to convert from one currency to another when selling  buying  hiring  borrowing  traveling  or investing across national borders
__label__1 the market in which people or firms use one currency to purchase another currency is called the foreign exchange market
__label__0 financial investments that cross international boundaries  and require exchanging currency  are often divided into two categories
__label__1 foreign direct investment  fdi  refers to purchasing a firm  at least ten percent  in another country or starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country
__label__0 for example  in  the belgian beer  brewing company inbev bought the us beer  maker anheuser  busch for   billion
__label__0 to make this purchase of a us firm  inbev would have to supply euros  the currency of belgium  to the foreign exchange market and demand us dollars
__label__1 most people and firms who are exchanging a substantial quantity of currency go to a bank  and most banks provide foreign exchange as a service to customers
__label__0 these banks  and a few other firms   known as dealers  then trade the foreign exchange
__label__0 this is called the interbank market
__label__1 this means that when comparing the exchange rates between two countries  in this case  the united states and canada   the depreciation  or weakening  of one country  the us dollar for this example  indicates the appreciation  or strengthening  of the other currency  which in this example is the canadian dollar
__label__0 source  federal reserve economic data  fred   a  httpsresearchstlouisfedorgfredseriesexcaus   b  httpsresearchstlouisfedorgfredseriesccusspcaqn  the bottom graph shows the exchange rate from us dollars to canadian dollars since
__label__0 this example shows how a stronger euro discourages exports by the french firm  because it makes the costs of production in the domestic currency higher relative to the sales revenues earned in another country
__label__0 from the point of view of the us economy  the example also shows how a weaker us dollar encourages exports
__label__0 exchange rates would bounce around less  too
__label__0 the economist milton friedman     for example  wrote a defense of floating exchange rates in  in his book capitalism and freedom  being in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor of unstable exchange rates
__label__0 when we support a free price system  for goods and services  at home  this does not imply that we favor a system in which prices fluctuate wildly up and down
__label__0 the brazilian central bank could weaken its exchange rate in two ways
__label__0 one approach is to use an expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates
__label__0 in foreign exchange markets  the lower interest rates will reduce demand and increase supply of the real and lead to depreciation
__label__0 when a country decides to alter the market exchange rate  it faces a number of tradeoffs
__label__0 if it uses monetary policy to alter the exchange rate  it then can not at the same time use monetary policy to address issues of inflation or recession
__label__0 if it uses direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates  then it must face the issue of how it will handle its reserves of foreign currency
__label__0 if a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets  it will be buying the currency of other countries  like us dollars or euros  to hold as reserves
__label__0 holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost  and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit
__label__1 taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as tobin taxes  named after james tobin  the  nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a  lecture
__label__0 for example  a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions  or attempt to tax short  term portfolio investment while exempting long  term foreign direct investment
__label__0 countries can also use regulation to forbid certain kinds of foreign investment in the first place or to make it difficult for international financial investors to withdraw their funds from a country
__label__0 the choice depends both on how well a nation s central bank can implement a specific exchange rate policy and on how well a nation s firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate policies
__label__0 a national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth  low inflation  low unemployment  and a sustainable balance of trade will probably do just fine most of the time with any exchange rate policy  conversely  no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that consistently fails at achieving these goals
__label__0 on the other hand  a merged currency applied across wide geographic and cultural areas carries with it its own set of problems  such as the ability for countries to conduct their own independent monetary policies
__label__0 government spending covers a range of services provided by the federal  state  and local governments
__label__1 when the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year  it runs a budget deficit
__label__1 conversely  when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year  it runs a budget surplus
__label__0 taxes also vary with marital status  family size  and other factors
__label__1 the marginal tax rates  the tax that must be paid on all yearly income  for a single taxpayer range from   to    depending on income  as the following clear it up feature explains
__label__0 the third  largest source of federal tax revenue  as shown in  link  is the corporate income tax
__label__0 the common name for corporate income is  profits   over time  corporate income tax receipts have declined as a share of gdp  from about   in the s to an average of   to   of gdp in the first decade of the s
__label__0 having discussed the revenue  taxes  and expense  spending  side of the budget  we now turn to the annual budget deficit or surplus  which is the difference between the tax revenue collected and spending over a fiscal year  which starts october  and ends september  of the next year
__label__0 even if the direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand is not totally offset by lower aggregate demand from higher interest rates  fiscal policy can end up being less powerful than was originally expected
__label__1 this is referred to as crowding out  where government borrowing and spending results in higher interest rates  which reduces business investment and household consumption
__label__0 finally  once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs
__label__1 the time to get the projects started is often called the implementation lag
__label__0 at this point  you may wonder about the federal reserve
__label__0 after all  can the federal reserve not use expansionary monetary policy to reduce interest rates  or in this case  to prevent interest rates from rising
__label__0 other government programs seek to increase human capital either before or after the k education system
__label__0 programs for early childhood education  like the federal head start program  are directed at families where the parents may have limited educational and financial resources
__label__0 government also offers substantial support for universities and colleges
__label__0 if the funding for a larger budget deficit comes from international financial investors  then a budget deficit may be accompanied by a trade deficit
__label__0 in some countries  this pattern of a twin deficits has set the stage for international financial investors first to send their funds to a country and cause an appreciation of its exchange rate and then to pull their funds out and cause a depreciation of the exchange rate and a financial crisis as well
__label__0 it depends on whether funding comes from international financial investors
__label__0 the differences in economic statistics and other measures of well  being  substantial though they are  do not fully capture the reasons for the enormous differences between countries
__label__0 aside from the neoclassical determinants of growth  four additional determinants are significant in a wide range of statistical studies and are worth mentioning  geography  demography  industrial structure  and institutions
__label__0 geographic and demographic differences
__label__0 this combination of technology  human capital  and physical capital  combined with the incentives of a market  oriented economic context  proved an extremely powerful stimulant to growth
__label__0 challenges faced by these middle  income countries are a legacy of government economic controls that for political reasons can be dismantled only slowly over time
__label__0 unemployment rates in the nations of europe have typically been higher than in the united states
__label__0 in   before the start of the great recession  the us unemployment rate was    compared with   in france    in germany  and   in sweden
__label__0 the pattern of generally higher unemployment rates in europe  which dates back to the s  is typically attributed to the fact that european economies have a higher natural rate of unemployment because they have a greater number of rules and restrictions that discourage firms from hiring and unemployed workers from taking jobs
__label__0 addressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward in theory but difficult in practice
__label__0 the economies of europe thrive with high levels of trade
__label__1 in the north american free trade agreement  nafta   the united states  canada  and mexico pledged themselves to reduce trade barriers
__label__0 many countries have clearly learned that reducing barriers to trade is at least potentially beneficial to the economy
__label__0 in order for a trade deficit to take place  foreign countries must provide loans or investments  which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually  that the deficit will become a surplus
__label__1 a trade surplus  you may remember  exists when a nation s exports exceed its imports
__label__0 so  in order for a trade deficit to switch to a trade surplus  a nation s exports must rise and its imports must fall
__label__1 recall from the chapter choice in a world of scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods
__label__0 the question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this   what do we give up to produce this good
__label__0 it should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from choice in a world of scarcity
__label__0 for example  if zambia focuses its resources on producing copper  its labor  land and financial resources can not be used to produce other goods such as corn
__label__0 given their current production levels  if the united states can trade an amount of corn fewer than  bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than  barrels  it will gain from trade
__label__0 with trade  the united states can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade
__label__0 recall that the chapter
__label__0 if mexico wants to produce more refrigerators without trade  it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce shoe production
__label__0 if mexico  instead  produces more shoes and then trades for refrigerators made in the united states  where the opportunity cost of producing refrigerators is lower  mexico can in effect take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of refrigerators in the united states
__label__0 conversely  when the united states specializes in its comparative advantage of refrigerator production and trades for shoes produced in mexico  international trade allows the united states to take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in mexico
__label__0 traditionally  tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic  social  and cultural interests
__label__0 the world trade organization  wto  is committed to lowering barriers to trade
__label__0 the world s nations meet through the wto to negotiate how they can reduce barriers to trade  such as tariffs
__label__0 they make imports more expensive for consumers  discouraging imports
__label__1 for example  in recent years large  flat  screen televisions imported from china have faced a   tariff rate  another way to control trade is through import quotas  which are numerical limitations on the quantity of products that can be imported
__label__0 for instance  during the early s  the reagan administration imposed a quota on the import of japanese automobiles
__label__0 each country has a domestic supply and demand for sugar  as detailed in  link  and illustrated in  link
__label__0 in brazil  without trade  the equilibrium price of sugar is  cents per pound and the equilibrium output is  tons
__label__0 while we applaud the technology spillovers of nasa s space projects  we should also acknowledge that those benefits are not shared equally
__label__0 economists like tyler cowen  a professor at george mason university  are seeing more and more evidence of a widening gap between those who have access to rapidly improving technology  and those who do not
__label__0 according to cowen author of the recent book  average is over  powering america beyond the age of the great stagnation  this inequality in access to technology and information is going to deepen the inequality in skills  and ultimately  in wages and global standards of living
__label__1 poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income  called the poverty line  that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living
__label__1 income inequality compares the share of the total income  or wealth  in society that is received by different groups  for example  comparing the share of income received by the top   to the share of income received by the bottom
__label__0 after all  according to the federal register  the median household income for a family of four was   in new jersey and   in mississippi in   and prices of some basic goods like housing are quite different between states
__label__1 the poverty line is based on cash income  which means it does not take into account government programs that provide assistance to the poor in a non  cash form  like medicaid  health care for low  income individuals and families  and food aid
__label__0 also  low  income families can qualify for federal housing assistance
__label__0 at the other extreme of the budget constraint line  an individual would work zero hours  earn zero income  but enjoy  hours of leisure
__label__0 at point a on the budget constraint line  by working  hours a week   weeks a year  the utility  maximizing choice is to work a total of  hours per year and earn  now suppose that a government antipoverty program guarantees every family with a single mother and two children   in income
__label__0 this is represented on the graph by a horizontal line at
__label__1 from the great depression of the s until   the united states  most visible antipoverty program was aid to families with dependent children  afdc   which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the poverty line
__label__0 this program was often just called  welfare
__label__0 in   congress passed and president bill clinton signed into law the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act  more commonly called the  welfare reform act   the new law replaced afdc with temporary assistance for needy families  tanf
__label__0 link  illustrates that the earned income tax credits  child tax credits  and the tanf program all cost the federal government money  either in direct outlays or in loss of tax revenues
__label__0 ctc stands for the government tax cuts for the child tax credit
__label__0 real federal spending on ctc  eitc  and tanf    eitc increased from more than   billion in  to over an estimated   billion by   far exceeding estimated  outlays in the ctc  child tax credits  and tanf of over   billion and   billion  respectively

__label__1 the safety net includes a number of other programs  government  subsidized school lunches and breakfasts for children from low  income families  the special supplemental food program for women  infants and children  wic   which provides food assistance for pregnant women and newborns  the low income home energy assistance program  which provides help with home heating bills  housing assistance  which helps pay the rent  and supplemental security income  which provides cash support for the disabled and the elderly poor
__label__1 income is a flow of money received  often measured on a monthly or an annual basis  wealth is the sum of the value of all assets  including money in bank accounts  financial investments  a pension fund  and the value of a home
__label__0 in calculating wealth all debts must be subtracted  such as debt owed on a home mortgage and on credit cards
__label__0 data from household income tax returns in  shows that the top   of households had an average income of   per year in pre  tax income and paid an average federal tax rate of
__label__1 the effective income tax  which is total taxes paid divided by total income  all sources of income such as wages  profits  interest  rental income  and government transfers such as veterans  benefits   was much lower
__label__0 the effective tax paid by the top   of householders was    while the bottom two quintiles actually paid negative effective income taxes  because of provisions like the earned income tax credit
__label__0 this labor market situation resembles what a monopoly firm does in selling a product  but in this case a union is a monopoly selling labor to firms
__label__0 at the higher union wage wu  the firms in this industry will hire less labor than they would have hired in equilibrium
__label__0 because over time unions were stronger in manufacturing than in service industries  the growth in jobs was not happening where the unions were
__label__1 it is interesting to note that several of the biggest unions in the country are made up of government workers  including the american federation of state  county and municipal employees  afscme   the service employees international union  and the national education association
__label__0 the membership of each of these unions is listed in  link
__label__0 a first public policy step against discrimination in the labor market is to make it illegal
__label__1 for example  the equal pay act of  said that men and women who do equal work at a company must be paid the same
__label__1 the civil rights act of  prohibits employment discrimination based on race  color  religion  sex  or national origin
__label__0 one disruptive effect  as just noted  is that immigration weighted toward low  skill workers tends to reduce wages for domestic low  skill workers
__label__0 a study by michael s clune found that for each   rise in the number of employed immigrants with no more than a high school diploma in the labor market  high school students reduced their annual number of hours worked by
__label__0 the effects on wages of low  skill workers are not large  perhaps in the range of decline of about
__label__1 many economic transactions are made in a situation of imperfect information  where either the buyer  the seller  or both  are less than   certain about the qualities of what is being bought and sold
__label__1 also  the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information  in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction
__label__1 a market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as a thin market
__label__1 by contrast  a market with many buyers and sellers is called a thick market
__label__1 sellers may offer a warranty  which is a promise to fix or replace the good  at least for a certain period of time
__label__1 the seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract  where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period
__label__1 another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan  that is  another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so
__label__1 yet another approach is to require collateral  often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid
__label__0 federal and state governments run a number of insurance programs
__label__0 some of the programs look much like private insurance  in the sense that the members of a group makes steady payments into a fund  and those in the group who suffer an adverse experience receive payments
__label__0 other programs protect against risk  but without an explicit fund being set up
__label__1 deposit insurance  banks are required by law to pay a small fraction of their deposits to the federal deposit insurance corporation  which goes into a fund that is used to pay depositors the value of their bank deposits up to    the amount was raised from   to   in   if the bank should go bankrupt
__label__0 some drivers are safer than others
__label__1 a risk group can be defined as a group that shares roughly the same risks of an adverse event occurring
__label__0 for example  auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than
__label__1 health insurance policies often have a copayment  in which the policyholder must pay a small amount  for example  a person might have to pay   for each doctor visit  and the insurance company would cover the rest
__label__1 another method of cost  sharing is coinsurance  which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost
__label__0 however  in the last decade or so  the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations  hmos
__label__1 a health maintenance organization  hmo  provides healthcare that receives a fixed amount per person enrolled in the plan  regardless of how many services are provided
__label__0 in this case  a patient with insurance has an incentive to demand more care  but the healthcare provider  which is receiving only a fixed payment  has an incentive to reduce the moral hazard problem by limiting the quantity of care provided  as long as it will not lead to worse health problems and higher costs later
__label__0 the profit trend has since continued to increase each year  though at a less steady or consistent rate
__label__0 source  federal reserve economic data  fred  httpsresearchstlouisfedorgfredseriescpatax   reports showed corporate profits after tax were around   billion
__label__1 venture capital firms make financial investments in new companies that are still relatively small in size  but that have potential to grow substantially
__label__0 these firms gather money from a variety of individual or institutional investors  including banks  institutions like college endowments  insurance companies that hold financial reserves  and corporate pension funds
__label__1 a corporation is a business that  incorporates   that is owned by shareholders that have limited liability for the debt of the company but share in its profits  and losses
__label__0 corporations may be private or public  and may or may not have stock that is publicly traded
__label__1 stock represents ownership of a firm  that is  a person who owns   of a company s stock  by definition  owns the entire company
__label__1 the stock of a company is divided into shares
__label__0 corporate giants like ibm  att  ford  general electric  microsoft  merck  and exxon all have millions of shares of stock
__label__0 alternatively  a financial investor might buy a share of stock in wal  mart for   and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for    for a gain of
__label__1 the increase in the value of the stock  or of any asset  between when it is bought and when it is sold is called a capital gain
__label__0 a larger law firm may be owned jointly by its partners
__label__0 most private companies are relatively small  but there are some large private corporations  with tens of billions of dollars in annual sales  that do not have publicly issued stock  such as farm products dealer cargill  the mars candy company  and the bechtel engineering and construction firm
__label__1 when a firm decides to sell stock  which in turn can be bought and sold by financial investors  it is called a public company
__label__0 shareholders own a public company
__label__1 the expected rate of return refers to how much a project or an investment is expected to return to the investor  either in future interest payments  capital gains  or increased profitability
__label__0 it is usually the average return over a period of time  usually in years or even decades
__label__0 another way to deposit savings at a bank is to use a certificate of deposit  cd
__label__1 with a cd  as it is commonly called  you agree to deposit a certain amount of money  often measured in thousands of dollars  in the account for a stated period of time  typically ranging from a few months to several years
__label__0 a bond is basically an  i owe you  note that is given to an investor in exchange for capital  money
__label__0 the bond has a face value
__label__1 this is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor at maturity
__label__1 the bond has a maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment
__label__1 combining the bond s face value  interest rate  and maturity date  and market interest rates  allows a buyer to compute a bond s present value  which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond
__label__0 this may or may not be the same as the face value
__label__0 the trend in the stock market is generally up over time  but with some large dips along the way

__label__0 broad measures of the stock market  like the ones listed here  tend to move together
__label__0 at the other end of the spectrum  a mutual fund might be quite broad  at the extreme  some mutual funds own a tiny share of every firm in the stock market  and thus the value of the mutual fund will fluctuate with the average of the overall stock market
__label__1 a mutual fund that seeks only to mimic the overall performance of the market is called an index fund
__label__1 simple interest is an interest rate calculation only on the principal amount
__label__1 a rational voter will recognize that one vote is extremely unlikely to make a difference
__label__1 this theory of rational ignorance holds that people will not vote if the costs of becoming informed and voting are too high  or they feel their vote will not be decisive in the election
__label__0 in a  work  an economic theory of democracy  the economist anthony downs stated the problem this way   it seems probable that for a great many citizens in a democracy  rational behavior excludes any investment whatever in political information per se
__label__0 no matter how significant a difference between parties is revealed to the rational citizen by his free information  or how uncertain he is about which party to support  he realizes that his vote has almost no chance of influencing the outcome  he will not even utilize all the free information available  since assimilating it takes time
__label__0 in his classic  novel walden two  the psychologist b f skinner puts the issue even more succinctly via one of his characters  who states   the chance that one man s vote will decide the issue in a national election  is less than the chance that he will be killed on his way to the polls

__label__1 special interest groups are groups that are small in number relative to the nation  but quite well organized and focused on a specific issue
__label__0 a special interest group can pressure legislators to enact public policies that do not benefit society as a whole
__label__1 in the early s  about  million people in the united states were eligible for medicare  a government program that provides health insurance for those  and older

__label__0 in the battle over passage of the  affordable care act  aca   which became known as  obamacare   there was heavy lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies
__label__0 however  a lobby group  health care for america now  hcan   was financed by labor unions and community groups and was organized to offset corporate lobbying
__label__0 hcan  spending   million dollars  was successful in helping to get the legislation passed which added new regulations on insurance companies and a mandate that all individuals will obtain health insurance by
__label__1 a nonprofit watchdog organization  called citizens against government waste  produces an annual report  the pig book that attempts to quantify the amount of pork  barrel spending  focusing on items that were requested by only one member of congress  that were passed into law without any public hearings  or that serve only a local purpose
__label__1 whether any specific item qualifies as pork can be controversial  of course  but at least by this measure  pork  barrel spending totaled   billion in pork  barrel spending can be encouraged by logrolling  an action in which all members of a group of legislators agree to vote for a package of otherwise unrelated laws that they individually favor
__label__0 for example  if one member of the us congress suggests building a new bridge or hospital in his or her own congressional district  the other members might oppose it
__label__0 this case goes against the theory of the  median  voter in a democracy
__label__1 the median voter theory argues that politicians will try to match policies to what pleases the median voter preferences
__label__0 if we think of political positions along a spectrum from left to right  the median voter is in the middle of the spectrum
__label__0 these three insights seldom lead to simple or obvious political conclusions
__label__0 as the famous british economist joan robinson wrote some decades ago    economic theory  in itself  preaches no doctrines and can not establish any universally valid laws
__label__0 it is a method of ordering ideas and formulating questions
__label__0 the study of economics is neither politically conservative  nor moderate  nor liberal
__label__0 how large is the us economy
__label__1 the size of a nation s overall economy is typically measured by its gross domestic product  gdp   which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year
__label__0 the measurement of gdp involves counting up the production of millions of different goods and services  smart phones  cars  music downloads  computers  steel  bananas  college educations  and all other new goods and services produced in the current year  and summing them into a total dollar value
__label__0 if starbucks builds a new store  or amazon buys robots  these expenditures are counted under business investment
__label__0 investment demand is far smaller than consumption demand  typically accounting for only about   of gdp  but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created
__label__0 however  it fluctuates more noticeably than consumption
__label__0 since the early s  imports have typically exceeded exports  and so the united states has experienced a trade deficit in most years
__label__0 indeed  the trade deficit grew quite large in the late s and in the mids
__label__0 they are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of a year
__label__1 statisticians who calculate gdp must avoid the mistake of double counting  in which output is counted more than once as it travels through the stages of production
__label__0 for example  imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the value of tires produced by a tire manufacturer  and then counted the value of a new truck sold by an automaker that contains those tires
__label__0 one of the closest cousins of gdp is the gross national product  gnp
__label__0 gdp includes only what is produced within a country s borders
__label__1 gdp deflator is a price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy
__label__0 we explore price indices in detail and how they are computed in inflation  but this definition will do in the context of this chapter
__label__0 the generally upward long  term path of gdp has been regularly interrupted by short  term declines
__label__1 a significant decline in real gdp is called a recession
__label__1 an especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression
__label__0 link  lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the us economy since
__label__1 the highest point of the economy  before the recession begins  is called the peak  conversely  the lowest point of a recession  before a recovery begins  is called the trough
__label__0 thus  a recession lasts from peak to trough  and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak
__label__1 to compare the gdp of countries with different currencies  it is necessary to convert to a  common denominator  using an exchange rate  which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency
__label__0 exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country a s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country b s currency  for example  japanese yen per british pound   or as the inverse  for example  british pounds per japanese yen
__label__1 let s begin with a brief overview of the spectacular patterns of economic growth around the world in the last two centuries  commonly referred to as the period of modern economic growth
__label__0 later in the chapter we will discuss lower rates of economic growth and some key ingredients for economic progress
__label__0 economic growth in the last two centuries has made a striking change in the human condition
__label__0 richard easterlin  an economist at the university of southern california  wrote in
__label__1 a microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm  or perhaps an industry
__label__1 in macroeconomics  the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function
__label__1 the category of physical capital includes the plant and equipment used by firms and also things like roads  also called infrastructure
__label__0 again  greater physical capital implies more output
__label__0 to obtain a per capita production function  divide each input in  link   a  by the population
__label__1 this creates a second aggregate production function where the output is gdp per capita  that is  gdp divided by population
__label__0 the inputs are the average level of human capital per person  the average level of physical capital per person  and the level of technology per person  see  link   b
__label__0 the european union has strong programs to invest in scientific research
__label__0 the researchers abraham garca and pierre mohnen demonstrate that firms which received support from the austrian government actually increased their research intensity and had more sales
__label__0 governments can support scientific research and technical training that helps to create and spread new technologies
__label__0 high  income countries must continually invent new technologies  whereas low  income countries can often find ways of applying technology that has already been invented and is well understood
__label__0 the economist alexander gerschenkron      gave this phenomenon a memorable name   the advantages of backwardness
__label__0 of course  he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower standard of living
__label__0 he was pointing out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up
__label__0 it also includes those who do want a job but have quit looking  often due to being discouraged by their inability to find suitable employment
__label__0 economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as out of the labor force or not in the labor force
__label__0 another important statistic is the labor force participation rate
__label__1 this is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job
__label__0 one reason is that the statistical agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the us bureau of the census
__label__0 but a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many low  income countries  most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly
__label__0 instead  workers in these countries are engaged in short  term work  subsistence activities  and barter
__label__0 from the standpoint of the supply  and  demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets  unemployment represents something of a puzzle
__label__1 in a supply  and  demand model of a labor market  as illustrated in  link   the labor market should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity
__label__0 at the equilibrium wage  we   the equilibrium quantity  qe  of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers
__label__1 at the equilibrium wage  we   the equilibrium quantity  qe  of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers
__label__0 economists looking for reasons why wages might be sticky downwards have focused on factors that may characterize most labor relationships in the economy  not just a few
__label__0 a number of different theories have been proposed  but they share a common tone
__label__1 the adverse selection of wage cuts argument points out that if an employer reacts to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all workers  then the best workers  those with the best employment alternatives at other firms  are the most likely to leave
__label__0 the least attractive workers  with fewer employment alternatives  are more likely to stay
__label__0 why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies  through good economic years and bad
__label__1 economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy  it is called the natural rate of unemployment
__label__0 another factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of structural unemployment
__label__1 the structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor market  either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have  or because they never learned any skills
__label__0 moreover  the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services  but wages and income levels  too
__label__0 the second  to  last row of  link  shows that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased nearly six  fold from  to
__label__0 step
__label__0 find the percentage change in the cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time periods
__label__0 the general equation for percentage changes between two years  whether in the context of inflation or in any other calculation  is
__label__0 the most commonly cited measure of inflation in the united states is the consumer price index  cpi
__label__1 the cpi is calculated by government statisticians at the us bureau of labor statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four
__label__0 if the new good is not included in the cpi for some years  until its price is already lower  the cpi may miss counting this price decline altogether
__label__1 taking these arguments together  the quality  new goods bias means that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer s true cost of living  because it does not take into account how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the invention of new goods improves the standard of living
__label__0 the following clear it up feature is a must  read on how the cpi is comprised and calculated
__label__0 it can be broken down into price indices for different industries  commodities  and stages of processing  like finished goods  intermediate goods  crude materials for further processing  and so on
__label__0 there is an international price index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported
__label__1 an employment cost index measures wage inflation in the labor market
__label__0 the first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms  they are right after world war i and world war ii
__label__1 however  there are also two periods of severe negative inflation  called deflation  in the early decades of the twentieth century  one following the deep recession of  and the other during the great depression of the s
__label__0 since inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced  deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services increases
__label__0 economists usually oppose high inflation  but they oppose it in a milder way than many non  economists
__label__0 robert shiller  one of  s nobel prize winners in economics  carried out several surveys during the s about attitudes toward inflation
__label__0 one of his questions asked   do you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national priority  as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools
__label__0 answers were on a scale of   where  meant  fully agree  and  meant  completely disagree   for the us population as a whole    answered  fully agree  that preventing high inflation was a highly important national priority and just   said  completely disagree   however  among professional economists  only   answered  fully agree   while the same percentage of   answered  completely disagree
__label__0 the land of funny money
__label__0 if all prices  wages  and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation  as in the land of funny money  then no one s purchasing power  profits  or real loan payments would change
__label__0 however  if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation  or if they adjust for inflation only after a time lag  then inflation can cause three types of problems  unintended redistributions of purchasing power  blurred price signals  and difficulties in long  term planning
__label__0 one sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase over time  retirees who receive a private company pension
__label__1 most pensions have traditionally been set as a fixed nominal dollar amount per year at retirement
__label__0 for this reason  pensions are called  defined benefits  plans
__label__1 high and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices are weaker
__label__0 markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly  and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of surpluses and shortages
__label__1 when a price  wage  or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation  it is said to be indexed
__label__1 an indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation
__label__0 loans often have built  in inflation adjustments  too  so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points  then the interest rate charged on the loan rises by two percentage points as well
__label__1 an adjustable  rate mortgage  arm  is a kind of loan used to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation
__label__0 often  a borrower will be able receive a lower interest rate if borrowing with an arm  compared to a fixed  rate loan
__label__1 the balance of trade  or trade balance  is any gap between a nation s dollar value of its exports  or what its producers sell abroad  and a nation s dollar worth of imports  or the foreign  made products and services that households and businesses purchase
__label__0 recall from the macroeconomic perspective that if exports exceed imports  the economy is said to have a trade surplus
__label__0 at some point  foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy and move their money to other countries
__label__0 the economy then drops into deep recession  with real gdp often falling up to   or more in a single year
__label__0 this happened to mexico in  when their gdp fell
__label__0 do not confuse the balance of trade  which tracks imports and exports   with the current account balance  which includes not just exports and imports  but also income from investment and transfers
__label__0 although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods  the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades
__label__1 for example  us exports of services were equal to about one  half of us exports of goods in   compared to one  fifth in the third component of the current account balance  labeled  income payments   refers to money received by us financial investors on their foreign investments  money flowing into the united states  and payments to foreign investors who had invested their funds here  money flowing out of the united states
__label__0 the reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade  along with goods and services  is that  from an economic perspective  income is just as much an economic transaction as shipments of cars or wheat or oil  it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market
__label__0 as economists see it  trade surpluses can be either good or bad  depending on circumstances  and trade deficits can be good or bad  too
__label__0 the challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of financial capital
__label__0 in this module we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways  a parable of trade between robinson crusoe and friday  and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments
__label__0 investment income stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country
__label__0 similarly  we see on the bottom third line  an investment from rest of the world into the home country and investment income  bottom fourth line  flowing from the home country to the rest of the world
__label__0 the investment income  bottom lines two and four  are found in the current account  while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country  lines one and three  are found in the financial account
__label__0 the fundamental notion that total quantity of financial capital demanded equals total quantity of financial capital supplied must always remain true
__label__0 domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital
__label__0 when japan s economy was growing vigorously in the s and s  its large trade surpluses were often described  especially by non  economists  as either a cause or a result of its robust economic health
__label__0 but from a standpoint of economic growth  japan s economy has been teetering in and out of recession since   with real gdp growth averaging only about   per year  and an unemployment rate that has been creeping higher
__label__0 clearly  a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health
__label__0 how is the rate of economic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate
__label__0 is there a reason why unemployment and inflation seem to move in opposite directions  lower unemployment and higher inflation from  to   higher unemployment and lower inflation in the early s  lower unemployment and higher inflation in the mids  and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in
__label__0 why did the current account deficit rise so high  but then decline in
__label__0 those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous french economist of the early nineteenth century named jean  baptiste say
__label__1 say s law is   supply creates its own demand   as a matter of historical accuracy  it seems clear that say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs  but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view  the intuition behind say s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold  it generates income that is earned for someone  a worker  a manager  an owner  or those who are workers  managers  and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production
__label__0 the forces of supply and demand in individual markets will cause prices to rise and fall
__label__0 nevertheless  a recession is not a situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes
__label__1 a recession is a situation in which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size  business failures outnumber the remaining success stories  and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers
__label__0 say s law that supply creates its own demand does seem a good approximation for the long run
__label__0 their excretory system consists of two tubules connected to a highly branched duct system
__label__1 the cells in the tubules are called flame cells  or protonephridia  because they have a cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when viewed under the microscope  as illustrated in  link  a
__label__0 the cilia propel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body through excretory pores that open on the body surface  cilia also draw water from the interstitial fluid  allowing for filtration
__label__0 animals that live in aquatic environments tend to release ammonia into the water
__label__1 animals that excrete ammonia are said to be ammonotelic
__label__0 terrestrial organisms have evolved other mechanisms to excrete nitrogenous wastes
__label__0 the first two reactions occur in the mitochondria and the last three reactions occur in the cytosol
__label__1 urea concentration in the blood  called blood urea nitrogen or bun  is used as an indicator of kidney function
__label__1 the environment consists of numerous pathogens  which are agents  usually microorganisms  that cause diseases in their hosts
__label__1 a host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen
__label__0 the innate immune system must respond accordingly  by identifying the extracellular pathogen andor by identifying host cells that have already been infected
__label__0 when a pathogen enters the body  cells in the blood and lymph detect the specific pathogen  associated molecular patterns  pamps  on the pathogen s surface
__label__1 pamps are carbohydrate  polypeptide  and nucleic acid  signatures  that are expressed by viruses  bacteria  and parasites but which differ from molecules on host cells
__label__1 the first cytokines to be produced are pro  inflammatory  that is  they encourage inflammation  the localized redness  swelling  heat  and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries to a site of infection
__label__1 the first cytokines to be produced are pro  inflammatory  that is  they encourage inflammation  the localized redness  swelling  heat  and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries to a site of infection
__label__0 the population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting pathogen
__label__0 neutrophils and eosinophils are particularly important leukocytes that engulf large pathogens  such as bacteria and fungi
__label__1 a mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules  such as histamine  in response to large pathogens
__label__1 a basophil is a leukocyte that  like a neutrophil  releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in  link
__label__1 lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large  darkly staining nuclei  they are small cells with very little cytoplasm  as shown in  link
__label__1 infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer  nk  cells  lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells  abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue
__label__1 infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer  nk  cells  lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells  abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue
__label__0 t cells and b cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes
__label__0 mhc ii molecules are found mainly on cells containing antigens   non  self proteins   and on lymphocytes
__label__1 mhc ii molecules interact with helper t  cells to trigger the appropriate immune response  which may include the inflammatory response
__label__0 lymphocytes  such as nk cells  are characterized by their large nuclei that actively absorb wright stain and therefore appear dark colored under a microscope
__label__0 
__label__1 an array of approximately  types of soluble proteins  called a complement system  functions to destroy extracellular pathogens
__label__0 cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously  these proteins are abundant in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms
__label__0 in fact  without information from the innate immune system  the adaptive response could not be mobilized
__label__0 there are two types of adaptive responses  the cell  mediated immune response  which is carried out by t cells  and the humoral immune response  which is controlled by activated b cells and antibodies
__label__0 activated t cells and b cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the invading pathogen
__label__0 antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the apc  where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells
__label__1 dendritic cells are immune cells that process antigen material  they are present in the skin  langerhans cells  and the lining of the nose  lungs  stomach  and intestines
__label__0 sometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response  thus functioning as an antigen  presenting cell
__label__0 nave cd  cells bind apcs via their antigen  embedded mhc ii molecules and are stimulated to become helper t  th  lymphocytes  cells that go on to stimulate b cells  or cytotoxic t cells  directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat
__label__0 in contrast  cd  cells engage antigen  embedded mhc i molecules on apcs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic t lymphocytes  ctls   which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response
__label__0 the two populations of t cells have different mechanisms of immune protection  but both bind mhc molecules via their antigen receptors called t cell receptors  tcrs
__label__1 plasma cells and ctls are collectively called effector cells  they represent differentiated versions of their nave counterparts  and they are involved in bringing about the immune defense of killing pathogens and infected host cells
__label__0 immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances  such as food proteins  that apcs of the oral cavity  pharynx  and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter
__label__1 immune tolerance is brought about by specialized apcs in the liver  lymph nodes  small intestine  and lung that present harmless antigens to an exceptionally diverse population of regulatory t  treg  cells  specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory immune factors
__label__0 the combined result of treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead
__label__1 the majority of cells in the blood are erythrocytes  red blood cells
__label__1 lymph is a watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs with protective white blood cells and does not contain erythrocytes
__label__0 cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems  which are separated by interstitial space  by a process called extravasation  passing through to surrounding tissue
__label__0 not all antibodies bind with the same strength  specificity  and stability
__label__1 in fact  antibodies exhibit different affinities  attraction  depending on the molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 an antibody with a higher affinity for a particular antigen would bind more strongly and stably  and thus would be expected to present a more challenging defense against the pathogen corresponding to the specific antigen
__label__0 once the afferent arterioles are constricted  blood flow into the nephrons stops
__label__0 these hormones go one step further and trigger the renin  angiotensin  aldosterone system
__label__1 renin acts on angiotensinogen  which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin i angiotensin converting enzyme  ace  converts angiotensin i to angiotensin ii
__label__0 angiotensin ii raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels
__label__1 the atrial natriuretic peptide  anp  lowers blood pressure by acting as a vasodilator
__label__0 it is released by cells in the atrium of the heart in response to high blood pressure and in patients with sleep apnea
__label__1 the immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody  mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy
__label__0 in the united states   percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma  whereas  percent test positive against one or more allergens
__label__0 both methods have advantages and disadvantages
__label__1 asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because the offspring are all clones of the original parent
__label__0 a single individual can produce offspring asexually and large numbers of offspring can be produced quickly
__label__1 buddingbudding is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of a cell or body region leading to a separation from the original organism into two individuals
__label__0 budding occurs commonly in some invertebrate animals such as corals and hydras
__label__1 hermaphroditism occurs in animals where one individual has both male and female reproductive parts
__label__0 invertebrates such as earthworms  slugs  tapeworms and snails  shown in  link   are often hermaphroditic
__label__1 in ovoviparity  fertilized eggs are retained in the female  but the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg s yolk and the young are fully developed when they are hatched
__label__0 this occurs in some bony fish  like the guppy lebistes reticulatus   some sharks  some lizards  some snakes  such as the garter snake thamnophis sirtalis   some vipers  and some invertebrate animals  like the madagascar hissing cockroach gromphadorhina portentosa
__label__0 vertebrates have similar structures  with a few differences
__label__1 non  mammals  such as birds and reptiles  have a common body opening  called a cloaca  for the digestive  excretory and reproductive systems
__label__0 coupling between birds usually involves positioning the cloaca openings opposite each other for transfer of sperm
__label__0 sperm mature in seminiferous tubules that are coiled inside the testes  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 the walls of the seminiferous tubules are made up of the developing sperm cells  with the least developed sperm at the periphery of the tubule and the fully developed sperm in the lumen
__label__1 the penis  illustrated in  link   is an organ that drains urine from the renal bladder and functions as a copulatory organ during intercourse
__label__0 the penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the length of the organ
__label__1 the mons pubis is a round  fatty area that overlies the pubic symphysis
__label__1 the clitoris is a structure with erectile tissue that contains a large number of sensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during intercourse
__label__1 the labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva
__label__0 internal female reproductive structures include ovaries  oviducts  the uterus  and the vagina  shown in  link
__label__0 the pair of ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments
__label__1 meiosis produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells
__label__1 the production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis
__label__0 at the onset of puberty  the hypothalamus causes the release of fsh and lh into the male system for the first time
__label__0 fsh enters the testes and stimulates the sertoli cells to begin facilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 lh also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of leydig to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood
__label__1 the ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs  while the menstrual cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining
__label__0 these cycles occur concurrently and are coordinated over a  day cycle  with an average length of  days
__label__0 to ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set of chromosomes  only one sperm must fuse with one egg
__label__1 in mammals  the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida
__label__0 when a sperm binds to the zona pellucida  a series of biochemical events  called the acrosomal reactions  take place
__label__0 cleavage can take place in two ways  holoblastic  total  cleavage or meroblastic  partial  cleavage
__label__0 the type of cleavage depends on the amount of yolk in the eggs
__label__0 during the first two to four weeks of the first trimester  nutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diffusion
__label__0 as the trimester progresses  the outer layer of the embryo begins to merge with the endometrium  and the placenta forms
__label__1 this organ takes over the nutrient and waste requirements of the embryo and fetus  with the mother s blood passing nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from it
__label__1 gastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise  during further development  to the different organs in the animal body
__label__0 this process is called organogenesis
__label__0 organogenesis is characterized by rapid and precise movements of the cells within the embryo
__label__1 ecology is the study of the interactions of living organisms with their environment
__label__0 one core goal of ecology is to understand the distribution and abundance of living things in the physical environment
__label__0 ecosystem ecology is an extension of organismal  population  and community ecology
__label__1 the ecosystem is composed of all the biotic components  living things  in an area along with the abiotic components  non  living things  of that area
__label__1 the ecosystem is composed of all the biotic components  living things  in an area along with the abiotic components  non  living things  of that area
__label__0 some of the abiotic components include air  water  and soil
__label__0 above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage
__label__1 a layer of trees rises above this understory and is topped by a closed upper canopy  the uppermost overhead layer of branches and leaves
__label__0 some additional trees emerge through this closed upper canopy
__label__1 all of the ocean s open water is referred to as the pelagic realm  or zone
__label__1 the benthic realm  or zone  extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor
__label__1 within the pelagic realm is the photic zone  which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate  approximately  m or  ft
__label__1 the intertidal zone  which is the zone between high and low tide  is the oceanic region that is closest to land   link
__label__0 generally  most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach
__label__1 phytoplankton and floating sargassum  a type of free  floating marine seaweed  provide a habitat for some sea life found in the neritic zone
__label__1 zooplankton  protists  small fishes  and shrimp are found in the neritic zone and are the base of the food chain for most of the world s fisheries  beyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the oceanic zone   link
__label__0 within the oceanic zone there is thermal stratification where warm and cold waters mix because of ocean currents
__label__0 watch this national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa  video to see marine ecologist dr peter etnoyer discusses his research on coral organisms  it is estimated that more than  fish species inhabit coral reefs
__label__1 these fishes can feed on coral  the cryptofauna  invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs   or the seaweed and algae that are associated with the coral
__label__0 in addition  some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef  these species include predators  herbivores  or planktivores
__label__1 humans rely on freshwater biomes to provide aquatic resources for drinking water  crop irrigation  sanitation  and industry
__label__0 these various roles and human benefits are referred to as ecosystem services
__label__0 lakes and ponds are found in terrestrial landscapes and are  therefore  connected with abiotic and biotic factors influencing these terrestrial biomes
__label__0 the source water is usually cold  low in nutrients  and clear
__label__1 the channel  the width of the river or stream  is narrower than at any other place along the length of the river or stream
__label__0 because of this  the current is often faster here than at any other point of the river or stream
__label__1 climate refers to the long  term  predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area
__label__0 the climate of a biome is characterized by having consistent temperature and annual rainfall ranges
__label__0 the variation in the sun s intensity is the second natural factor responsible for climate change
__label__1 solar intensity is the amount of solar power or energy the sun emits in a given amount of time
__label__0 there is a direct relationship between solar intensity and temperature
__label__0 for mobile organisms  such as mammals  birds  or fish  a technique called mark and recapture is often used
__label__1 this method involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way  such as tags  bands  paint  or other body markings   and then releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population  later  a new sample is collected  including some individuals that are marked  recaptures  and some individuals that are unmarked   link
__label__1 another tool used by population ecologists is a survivorship curve  which is a graph of the number of individuals surviving at each age interval plotted versus time  usually with data compiled from a life table
__label__0 these curves allow us to compare the life histories of different populations   link
__label__0 after  day and  of these cycles  the population would have increased from  to more than  billion
__label__0 when the population size  n  is plotted over time  a j  shaped growth curve is produced   linkthe bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited
__label__0 furthermore  some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce  lowering the growth rate
__label__0 obviously  a bacterium can reproduce more rapidly and have a higher intrinsic rate of growth than a human
__label__0 the maximal growth rate for a species is its biotic potential  or rmax  thus changing the equation to
__label__0 while some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration  other species have evolved mechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten  even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or contain toxic chemicals
__label__1 in batesian mimicry  a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one
__label__0 assuming they share the same predators  this coloration then protects the harmless ones  even though they do not have the same level of physical or chemical defenses against predation as the organism they mimic
__label__1 all species have an ecological niche in the ecosystem  which describes how they acquire the resources they need and how they interact with other species in the community
__label__1 the competitive exclusion principle states that two species can not occupy the same niche in a habitat
__label__0 in other words  different species can not coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources
__label__1 a second type of symbiotic relationship is called mutualism  where two species benefit from their interaction
__label__0 some scientists believe that these are the only true examples of symbiosis
__label__1 succession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time
__label__1 in primary succession  newly exposed or newly formed land is colonized by living things  in secondary succession  part of an ecosystem is disturbed and remnants of the previous community remain
__label__1 behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus
__label__1 behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes
__label__1 one goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors  which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences  from the learned behaviors  which result from environmental conditioning
__label__0 innate behavior  or instinct  is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned
__label__1 a similar  but more directed version of kinesis is taxis  the directed movement towards or away from a stimulus
__label__0 this movement can be in response to light  phototaxis   chemical signals  chemotaxis   or gravity  geotaxis  and can be directed toward  positive  or away  negative  from the source of the stimulus
__label__1 foraging is the act of searching for and exploiting food resources
__label__1 feeding behaviors that maximize energy gain and minimize energy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors  and these are favored by natural section
__label__0 significant energy is spent in the process of locating  attracting  and mating with the sex partner
__label__1 two types of selection occur during this process and can lead to traits that are important to reproduction called secondary sexual characteristics  intersexual selection  the choosing of a mate where individuals of one sex choose mates of the other sex  and intrasexual selection  the competition for mates between species members of the same sex
__label__0 intersexual selection is often complex because choosing a mate may be based on a variety of visual  aural  tactile  and chemical cues
__label__1 in polyandrous mating systems  one female mates with many males
__label__0 these types of systems are much rarer than monogamous and polygynous mating systems
__label__1 conditioned behaviors are types of associative learning  where a stimulus becomes associated with a consequence
__label__1 during operant conditioning  the behavioral response is modified by its consequences  with regards to its form  strength  or frequency
__label__0 some primates  including humans  are able to learn by imitating the behavior of others and by taking instructions
__label__1 the development of complex language by humans has made cognitive learning  the manipulation of information using the mind  the most prominent method of human learning
__label__0 in fact  that is how students are learning right now by reading this book
__label__1 fecundity is the potential reproductive capacity of an individual within a population
__label__0 in other words  fecundity describes how many offspring could ideally be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible  repeating the reproductive cycle as soon as possible after the birth of the offspring
__label__0 additionally  populations do not usually exist in isolation
__label__1 they engage in interspecific competition  that is  they share the environment with other species  competing with them for the same resources
__label__0 these factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow
__label__0 in contrast  r  selected species have a large number of small offspring  hence their r designation   link
__label__0 this strategy is often employed in unpredictable or changing environments
__label__0 the scientific understanding of a food chain is more precise than in its everyday usage
__label__1 in ecology  a food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass  primary producers  primary consumers  and higher  level consumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics
__label__0 there is a single path through the chain
__label__1 tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores
__label__1 higher  level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels  and so on  up to the organisms at the top of the food chain  the apex consumers
__label__0 in the lake ontario food chain shown in  link   the chinook salmon is the apex consumer at the top of this food chain
__label__1 a grazing food web  such as the lake ontario food web in  link   has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base  followed by herbivores and various carnivores
__label__1 a detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter  dead organisms   called decomposers or detritivores
__label__1 a detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter  dead organisms   called decomposers or detritivores
__label__0 these organisms are usually bacteria or fungi that recycle organic material back into the biotic part of the ecosystem as they themselves are consumed by other organisms
__label__1 an analytical model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics
__label__1 a simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics
__label__0 ideally  these models are accurate enough to determine which components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances  and they can serve as a guide to ecosystem managers  such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists  in the practical maintenance of ecosystem health
__label__0 one of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification
__label__1 biomagnification is the increasing concentration of persistent  toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level  from the primary producers to the apex consumers
__label__0 many substances have been shown to bioaccumulate  including classical studies with the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane  ddt   which was published in the s bestseller  silent spring  by rachel carson
__label__0 as rain falls through this gas  it creates the phenomenon known as acid rain
__label__1 acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through sulfur dioxide gas  turning it into weak sulfuric acid  which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems
__label__0 acid rain damages the natural environment by lowering the ph of lakes  which kills many of the resident fauna  it also affects the man  made environment through the chemical degradation of buildings
__label__0 the nile perch was introduced in   but lay low until the s when its populations began to surge
__label__0 the nile perch population grew by consuming cichlids  driving species after species to the point of extinction  the disappearance of a species
__label__0 in fact  there were several factors that played a role in the extinction of perhaps  cichlid species in lake victoria  the nile perch  declining lake water quality due to agriculture and land clearing on the shores of lake victoria  and increased fishing pressure
__label__1 it is also useful to define ecosystem diversity  meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or in a given geographic area   link
__label__0 whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to other ecosystems
__label__0 in   british environmentalist norman myers developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in species and at significant risk for species loss  biodiversity hotspots
__label__1 biodiversity hotspots are geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species
__label__0 the purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation efforts  a kind of conservation triage
__label__0 a second approach to estimating present  time extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss by measuring forest  area loss and understanding species  area relationships
__label__1 the species  area relationship is the rate at which new species are seen when the area surveyed is increased
__label__0 studies have shown that the number of species present increases as the size of the island increases
__label__1 view a brief video discussing the role of marine ecosystems in supporting human welfare and the decline of ocean ecosystems  bush meat is the generic term used for wild animals killed for food
__label__0 hunting is practiced throughout the world  but hunting practices  particularly in equatorial africa and parts of asia  are believed to threaten several species with extinction
__label__0 early evidence suggests that another fungal pathogen  geomyces destructans  introduced from europe is responsible for white  nose syndrome  which infects cave  hibernating bats in eastern north america and has spread from a point of origin in western new york state   link
__label__0 this is precisely the situation that charles darwin describes in the theory of evolution by natural selection   link
__label__1 in simple terms  the theory states that organisms that are better suited for their environment will survive and reproduce  while those that are poorly suited for their environment will die off
__label__0 during the egg s journey from the ovary through the fallopian tubes  to the uterus  a sperm may fertilize an egg  the egg and the sperm each contain  chromosomes
__label__1 chromosomes are long strings of genetic material known as deoxyribonucleic acid  dna
__label__1 dna is a helix  shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs
__label__1 therefore  each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring  the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring  called the phenotype  are determined by the interaction of genetic material supplied by the parents  called the genotype
__label__1 a person s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual
__label__1 phenotype  on the other hand  refers to the individual s inherited physical characteristics  which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences   link
__label__1 a  genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material  dna  inherited from one s parents
__label__0 so far  we have discussed traits that involve just one gene  but few human characteristics are controlled by a single gene
__label__1 most traits are polygenic  controlled by more than one gene
__label__0 height is one example of a polygenic trait  as are skin color and weight
__label__0 in this punnett square  n represents the normal allele  and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with pku
__label__0 each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment  range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction
__label__1 range of reaction asserts that our genes set the boundaries within which we can operate  and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in that range we will fall
__label__0 for example  if an individual s genetic makeup predisposes her to high levels of intellectual potential and she is reared in a rich  stimulating environment  then she will be more likely to achieve her full potential than if she were raised under conditions of significant deprivation
__label__0 as mentioned earlier  gene expression is often influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious
__label__1 for instance  identical twins share the same genetic information  identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that split  so the genetic material is exactly the same in each  in contrast  fraternal twins develop from two different eggs fertilized by different sperm  so the genetic material varies as with non  twin siblings
__label__0 but even with identical genes  there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of each twin s life
__label__0 in a study of people who were given up for adoption  adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study
__label__1 glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built  help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication  provide insulation to neurons  transport nutrients and waste products  and mediate immune responses
__label__1 neurons  on the other hand  serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system
__label__0 this section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons
__label__1 the nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma  or cell body
__label__0 the soma has branching extensions known as dendrites
__label__0 these signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon  which ends at multiple terminal buttons
__label__1 the terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters  the chemical messengers of the nervous system
__label__1 the terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters  the chemical messengers of the nervous system
__label__0 once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse  they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron
__label__1 receptors  proteins on the cell surface where neurotransmitters attach  vary in shape  with different shapes  matching  different neurotransmitters
__label__1 between signals  the neuron membrane s potential is held in a state of readiness  called the resting potential
__label__0 like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action  ions line up on either side of the cell membrane  ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates  ie  a sodium  potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane
__label__1 this positive spike constitutes the action potential  the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals
__label__0 the electrical signal moves down the axon like a wave  at each point  some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon  raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions
__label__0 the neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron  and the process repeats itself in the new neuron  assuming the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential
__label__0 once the signal is delivered  excess neurotransmitters in the synapse drift away  are broken down into inactive fragments  or are reabsorbed in a process known as reuptake
__label__1 reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron that released it  in order to clear the synapse   link
__label__0 in this perspective  psychotropic medications can help improve the symptoms associated with these disorders
__label__1 psychotropic medications are drugs that treat psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance
__label__0 acetylcholine is involved in muscle action and memory  it can increase arousal and enhance cognition
__label__0 the nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions  the central nervous system  cns  and the peripheral nervous system  pns   shown in  link
__label__1 the cns is comprised of the brain and spinal cord  the pns connects the cns to the rest of the body
__label__0 it can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions   link
__label__1 the sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress  related activities  the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine  day  to  day operations
__label__0 the two systems have complementary functions  operating in tandem to maintain the body s homeostasis
__label__0 for example  think about how you feel when you have to stand up and give a presentation in front of a roomful of people  or right before taking a big test
__label__0 you are in no real physical danger in those situations  and yet you have evolved to respond to any perceived threat with the fight or flight response
__label__0 this kind of response is not nearly as adaptive in the modern world  in fact  we suffer negative health consequences when faced constantly with psychological threats that we can neither fight nor flee
__label__0 these gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers
__label__1 the most prominent sulcus  known as the longitudinal fissure  is the deep groove that separates the brain into two halves or hemispheres  the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere
__label__0 forebrain structuresthe two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex are part of the forebrain   link    which is the largest part of the brain
__label__1 the forebrain contains the cerebral cortex and a number of other structures that lie beneath the cortex  called subcortical structures   thalamus  hypothalamus  pituitary gland  and the limbic system  collection of structures
__label__0 probably the most famous case of frontal lobe damage is that of a man by the name of phineas gage
__label__0 on september     gage  age   was working as a railroad foreman in vermont
__label__1 the brain s parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe  and is involved in processing information from the body s senses
__label__1 it contains the somatosensory cortex  which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body  such as touch  temperature  and pain
__label__0 the somatosensory cortex is organized topographically  which means that spatial relationships that exist in the body are maintained on the surface of the somatosensory cortex   link
__label__1 the auditory cortex  the main area responsible for processing auditory information  is located within the temporal lobe
__label__1 wernicke s area  important for speech comprehension  is also located here
__label__0 whereas individuals with damage to broca s area have difficulty producing language  those with damage to wernicke s area can produce sensible language  but they are unable to understand it   link
__label__0 other areas of the forebrainother areas of the forebrain  located beneath the cerebral cortex  include the thalamus and the limbic system
__label__1 the thalamus is a sensory relay for the brain
__label__0 all of our senses  with the exception of smell  are routed through the thalamus before being directed to other areas of the brain for processing   link
__label__1 the hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory
__label__1 the amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories
__label__1 the hypothalamus regulates a number of homeostatic processes  including the regulation of body temperature  appetite  and blood pressure
__label__1 midbrain and hindbrain structuresthe midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain  between the forebrain and the hindbrain
__label__1 the reticular formation is centered in the midbrain  but it actually extends up into the forebrain and down into the hindbrain
__label__1 the hindbrain is located at the back of the head and looks like an extension of the spinal cord
__label__0 it contains the medulla  pons  and cerebellum   link
__label__1 the cerebellum  latin for  little brain   receives messages from muscles  tendons  joints  and structures in our ear to control balance  coordination  movement  and motor skills
__label__0 the cerebellum is also thought to be an important area for processing some types of memories
__label__1 a computerized tomography  ct  scan involves taking a number of x  rays of a particular section of a person s body or brain   link
__label__0 the x  rays pass through tissues of different densities at different rates  allowing a computer to construct an overall image of the area of the body being scanned
__label__0 tissues of different densities give off different signals  which a computer interprets and displays on a monitor
__label__1 functional magnetic resonance imaging  fmri  operates on the same principles  but it shows changes in brain activity over time by tracking blood flow and oxygen levels
__label__0 the fmri provides more detailed images of the brain s structure  as well as better accuracy in time  than is possible in pet scans   link
__label__1 major glandsthe pituitary gland descends from the hypothalamus at the base of the brain  and acts in close association with it
__label__0 the pituitary is often referred to as the  master gland  because its messenger hormones control all the other glands in the endocrine system  although it mostly carries out instructions from the hypothalamus
__label__1 the adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response  such as epinephrine  adrenaline  and norepinephrine  noradrenaline
__label__1 the pancreas is an internal organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels  insulin and glucagon
__label__0 these pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels  insulin  or raising them  glucagon
__label__0 for one  each participant must sign an informed consent form before they can participate in the experiment
__label__1 an informed consent form provides a written description of what participants can expect during the experiment  including potential risks and implications of the research
__label__0 it also lets participants know that their involvement is completely voluntary and can be discontinued without penalty at any time
__label__0 a participant in the tuskegee syphilis study receives an injection
__label__0 
__label__1 correlation means that there is a relationship between two or more variables  such as ice cream consumption and crime   but this relationship does not necessarily imply cause and effect
__label__1 when two variables are correlated  it simply means that as one variable changes  so does the other
__label__0 put another way  it means that as one variable increases so does the other  and conversely  when one variable decreases so does the other
__label__1 a negative correlation means that the variables move in opposite directions
__label__0 if two variables are negatively correlated  a decrease in one variable is associated with an increase in the other and vice versa
__label__0 think back to our discussion of the research done by the american cancer society and how their research projects were some of the first demonstrations of the link between smoking and cancer
__label__0 it seems reasonable to assume that smoking causes cancer  but if we were limited to correlational research  we would be overstepping our bounds by making this assumption
__label__0 as you ve learned  the only way to establish that there is a cause  and  effect relationship between two variables is to conduct a scientific experiment
__label__0 experiment has a different meaning in the scientific context than in everyday life
__label__0 we also need to precisely define  or operationalize  what is considered violent and nonviolent
__label__1 an operational definition is a description of how we will measure our variables  and it is important in allowing others understand exactly how and what a researcher measures in a particular experiment
__label__0 in operationalizing violent behavior  we might choose to count only physical acts like kicking or punching as instances of this behavior  or we also may choose to include angry verbal exchanges
__label__1 in a double  blind study  both the researchers and the participants are blind to group assignments
__label__0 why would a researcher want to run a study where no one knows who is in which group
__label__0 in our example of how violent television programs affect children s display of violent behavior  the independent variable is the type of program  violent or nonviolent  viewed by participants in the study   link
__label__1 a dependent variable is what the researcher measures to see how much effect the independent variable had
__label__0 in our example  the dependent variable is the number of violent acts displayed by the experimental participants
__label__0 now that we have a sample  the next step of the experimental process is to split the participants into experimental and control groups through random assignment
__label__1 with random assignment  all participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either group
__label__0 there is statistical software that will randomly assign each of the fourth graders in the sample to either the experimental or the control group
__label__0 the american psychological association  apa  publishes a manual detailing how to write a paper for submission to scientific journals
__label__1 unlike an article that might be published in a magazine like psychology today  which targets a general audience with an interest in psychology  scientific journals generally publish peer  reviewed journal articles aimed at an audience of professionals and scholars who are actively involved in research themselves
__label__0 this is where validity comes into play
__label__1 validity refers to the extent to which a given instrument or tool accurately measures what it s supposed to measure
__label__0 while any valid measure is by necessity reliable  the reverse is not necessarily true
__label__0 we want our researcher to be inconspicuous  perhaps standing at one of the sinks pretending to put in contact lenses while secretly recording the relevant information
__label__1 this type of observational study is called naturalistic observation  observing behavior in its natural setting
__label__0 to better understand peer exclusion  suzanne fanger collaborated with colleagues at the university of texas to observe the behavior of preschool children on a playground
__label__0 another potential problem in observational research is observer bias
__label__1 generally  people who act as observers are closely involved in the research project and may unconsciously skew their observations to fit their research goals or expectations
__label__0 surveys allow researchers to gather data from larger samples than may be afforded by other research methods
__label__1 a sample is a subset of individuals selected from a population  which is the overall group of individuals that the researchers are interested in
__label__1 a sample is a subset of individuals selected from a population  which is the overall group of individuals that the researchers are interested in
__label__0 researchers study the sample and seek to generalize their findings to the population
__label__0 another approach is cross  sectional research
__label__1 in cross  sectional research  a researcher compares multiple segments of the population at the same time
__label__0 using the dietary habits example above  the researcher might directly compare different groups of people by age
__label__0 one of your responsibilities is to manage the state budget and determine how to best spend your constituents  tax dollars
__label__0 as the new governor  you need to decide whether to continue funding the dare
__label__0 drug abuse resistance education  program in public schools   link
__label__1 this program typically involves police officers coming into the classroom to educate students about the dangers of becoming involved with alcohol and other drugs
__label__0 the types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive
__label__1 in deductive reasoning  ideas are tested against the empirical world  in inductive reasoning  empirical observations lead to new ideas   link
__label__0 these processes are inseparable  like inhaling and exhaling  but different research approaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive aspects
__label__0 a scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable  or capable of being shown to be incorrect
__label__0 recall from the introductory chapter that sigmund freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors   link
__label__0 the word psychology was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished  green
__label__1 the root ology denotes scientific study of  and psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind
__label__0 since science studies only observable phenomena and the mind is not directly observable  we expand this definition to the scientific study of mind and behavior  the scientific study of any aspect of the world uses the scientific method to acquire knowledge
__label__0 rather  philosophy in this context refers to many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and sciences  the requirements to earn a phd vary from country to country and even from school to school  but usually  individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation
__label__1 a dissertation is essentially a long research paper or bundled published articles describing research that was conducted as a part of the candidate s doctoral training
__label__0 in the united states  a dissertation generally has to be defended before a committee of expert reviewers before the degree is conferred   link
__label__0 contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in the preceding section
__label__0 reflective of the discipline s diversity is the diversity seen within the american psychological association  apa
__label__1 the apa is a professional organization representing psychologists in the united states
__label__0 scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception   link
__label__0 as such  sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary
__label__0 early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood  providing enormous insight into the differences in physical  cognitive  and social capacities that exist between very young children and adults
__label__0 for instance  research by jean piaget   link   demonstrated that very young children do not demonstrate object permanence
__label__1 object permanence refers to the understanding that physical things continue to exist  even if they are hidden from us
__label__1 personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior  and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals
__label__0 these five dimensions are known as the  big five  or the five factor model  and include dimensions of conscientiousness  agreeableness  neuroticism  openness  and extraversion   link
__label__0 each of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan  eg  rantanen  metspelto  feldt  pulkinnen  and kokko    soldz  vaillant    mccrae  costa    and is influenced by genetics  eg  jang  livesly  and vernon
__label__1 industrial  organizational psychology  i  o psychology  is a subfield of psychology that applies psychological theories  principles  and research findings in industrial and organizational settings
__label__0 i  o psychologists are often involved in issues related to personnel management  organizational structure  and workplace environment
__label__1 researchers in sport and exercise psychology study the psychological aspects of sport performance  including motivation and performance anxiety  and the effects of sport on mental and emotional wellbeing
__label__0 research is also conducted on similar topics as they relate to physical exercise in general
__label__0 as mentioned earlier  both freud and rogers provided perspectives that have been influential in shaping how clinicians interact with people seeking psychotherapy
__label__0 while aspects of the psychoanalytic theory are still found among some of today s therapists who are trained from a psychodynamic perspective  roger s ideas about client  centered therapy have been especially influential in shaping how many clinicians operate
__label__0 furthermore  both behaviorism and the cognitive revolution have shaped clinical practice in the forms of behavioral therapy  cognitive therapy  and cognitive  behavioral therapy   link
__label__0 wundt viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience  and he believed that the goal of psychology was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious experience
__label__1 wundt used introspection  he called it  internal perception    a process by which someone examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible  making the human mind like any other aspect of nature that a scientist observed
__label__0 wundt s version of introspection used only very specific experimental conditions in which an external stimulus was designed to produce a scientifically observable  repeatable  experience of the mind  danziger
__label__1 adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a function for the survival and reproduction of the individual  because it has been naturally selected
__label__0 as james saw it  psychology s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world  and as such  his perspective was known as functionalism
__label__1 functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its environment
__label__0 these men are credited with introducing psychologists in the united states to various gestalt principles
__label__1 the word gestalt roughly translates to  whole   a major emphasis of gestalt psychology deals with the fact that although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts  how those parts relate to each other as a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception
__label__0 for example  a song may be made up of individual notes played by different instruments  but the real nature of the song is perceived in the combinations of these notes as they form the melody  rhythm  and harmony
__label__1 because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible  watson preferred to focus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control
__label__0 watson was a major proponent of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior  and this approach of observing and controlling behavior came to be known as behaviorism
__label__0 a major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism
__label__0 thus  humanism emerged
__label__1 humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans
__label__0 two of the most well  known proponents of humanistic psychology are abraham maslow and carl rogers  ohara  nd
__label__0 culture has important impacts on individuals and social psychology  yet the effects of culture on psychology are under  studied
__label__0 there is a risk that psychological theories and data derived from white  american settings could be assumed to apply to individuals and social groups from other cultures and this is unlikely to be true  betancourt  lpez
__label__1 sleep is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakefulness
__label__1 wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness  thought  and behavior
__label__0 in between these extremes are states of consciousness related to daydreaming  intoxication as a result of alcohol or other drug use  meditative states  hypnotic states  and altered states of consciousness following sleep deprivation
__label__0 if we have biological rhythms  then is there some sort of biological clock
__label__1 in the brain  the hypothalamus  which lies above the pituitary gland  is a main center of homeostasis
__label__0 for example  most people sleep during the night and are awake during the day
__label__0 one important regulator of sleep  wake cycles is the hormone melatonin
__label__1 the pineal gland  an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases melatonin  is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system during sleep  hardeland  pandi  perumal   cardinali
__label__0 when we do this  we often experience jet lag
__label__1 jet lag is a collection of symptoms that results from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment
__label__1 these symptoms include fatigue  sluggishness  irritability  and insomnia  ie  a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week over a month s time   roth
__label__0 when people have difficulty getting sleep due to their work or the demands of day  to  day life  they accumulate a sleep debt
__label__0 a person with a sleep debt does not get sufficient sleep on a chronic basis
__label__0 the consequences of sleep debt include decreased levels of alertness and mental efficiency
__label__0 one popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology
__label__1 evolutionary psychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have evolved over time as a result of natural selection
__label__0 variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior make individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring
__label__0 the first stage of nrem sleep is known as stage  sleep
__label__1 stage  sleep is a transitional phase that occurs between wakefulness and sleep  the period during which we drift off to sleep
__label__0 during this time  there is a slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat
__label__1 as we move into stage  sleep  the body goes into a state of deep relaxation
__label__0 theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain  but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles   link
__label__0 theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain  but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles   link
__label__1 stage  and stage  of sleep are often referred to as deep sleep or slow  wave sleep because these stages are characterized by low frequency  up to  hz   high amplitude delta waves   link
__label__0 during this time  an individual s heart rate and respiration slow dramatically
__label__1 manifest content is the actual content  or storyline  of a dream
__label__1 latent content  on the other hand  refers to the hidden meaning of a dream
__label__0 for instance  if a woman dreams about being chased by a snake  freud might have argued that this represents the woman s fear of sexual intimacy  with the snake serving as a symbol of a man s penis
__label__0 some forms of psychotherapy  such as cognitive  behavioral therapy  can help sufferers of insomnia
__label__1 cognitive  behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on cognitive processes and problem behaviors
__label__0 the treatment of insomnia likely would include stress management techniques and changes in problematic behaviors that could contribute to insomnia  eg  spending more waking time in bed
__label__1 rem sleep behavior disorder  rbd  occurs when the muscle paralysis associated with the rem sleep phase does not occur
__label__0 individuals who suffer from rbd have high levels of physical activity during rem sleep  especially during disturbing dreams
__label__1 sleep apnea is defined by episodes during which a sleeper s breathing stops
__label__0 these episodes can last    seconds or longer and often are associated with brief periods of arousal
__label__1 in central sleep apnea  disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing  white
__label__0 one of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep
__label__1 a continuous positive airway pressure  cpap  device includes a mask that fits over the sleeper s nose and mouth  which is connected to a pump that pumps air into the person s airways  forcing them to remain open  as shown in  link
__label__0 some newer cpap masks are smaller and cover only the nose
__label__1 unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section  a person with narcolepsy can not resist falling asleep at inopportune times
__label__1 these sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy  which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness  and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles
__label__0 this is similar to the kind of paralysis experienced by healthy individuals during rem sleep  burgess  scammell    hishikawa  shimizu    luppi et al
__label__0 in individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder  there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence
__label__1 in individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder  there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence
__label__1 physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions  the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use
__label__1 physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions  the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use
__label__1 in contrast  a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional  rather than physical  need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress
__label__1 tolerance is linked to physiological dependence  and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower doses
__label__0 ethanol  which we commonly refer to as alcohol  is in a class of psychoactive drugs known as depressants   link
__label__1 a depressant is a drug that tends to suppress central nervous system activity
__label__0 other depressants include barbiturates and benzodiazepines
__label__0 the cocaine  amphetamine  cathinones  and mdma users seek a euphoric high  feelings of intense elation and pleasure  especially in those users who take the drug via intravenous injection or smoking
__label__0 repeated use of these stimulants can have significant adverse consequences
__label__1 an opioid is one of a category of drugs that includes heroin  morphine  methadone  and codeine
__label__0 opioids have analgesic properties  that is  they decrease pain
__label__1 methadone is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs
__label__1 methadone clinics help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of methadone
__label__0 other drugs  including the opioid buprenorphine  have also been used to alleviate symptoms of opiate withdrawal
__label__1 hypnosis is a state of extreme self  focus and attention in which minimal attention is given to external stimuli
__label__0 in the therapeutic setting  a clinician may use relaxation and suggestion in an attempt to alter the thoughts and perceptions of a patient
__label__0 these cells relay messages  in the form of action potentials  as you learned when studying biopsychology   to the central nervous system
__label__1 the conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction
__label__1 sometimes  we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to detect a difference between them
__label__0 this is known as the just noticeable difference  jnd  or difference threshold
__label__0 unlike the absolute threshold  the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus intensity
__label__1 on the other hand  how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge  our experiences  and our thoughts
__label__0 this is called top  down processing
__label__0 if so  then you have experienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between a true sensory stimulus and background noise
__label__1 the ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a distracting background is called signal detection theory
__label__0 this might also explain why a mother is awakened by a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep
__label__0 two physical characteristics of a wave are amplitude and wavelength   link
__label__1 the amplitude of a wave is the height of a wave as measured from the highest point on the wave  peak or crest  to the lowest point on the wave  trough
__label__1 wavelength refers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next
__label__1 the visible spectrum is the portion of the larger electromagnetic spectrum that we can see
__label__0 as  link  shows  the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all of the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our environment and includes gamma rays  x  rays  ultraviolet light  visible light  infrared light  microwaves  and radio waves
__label__0 this is known as the timbre of a sound
__label__1 timbre refers to a sound s purity  and it is affected by the complex interplay of frequency  amplitude  and timing of sound waves
__label__0 it serves as a barrier between the inner eye and the outside world  and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye
__label__1 the pupil is the small opening in the eye through which light passes  and the size of the pupil can change as a function of light levels as well as emotional arousal
__label__0 when light levels are low  the pupil will become dilated  or expanded  to allow more light to enter the eye
__label__0 the lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is reflected from near or far objects
__label__1 in a normal  sighted individual  the lens will focus images perfectly on a small indentation in the back of the eye known as the fovea  which is part of the retina  the light  sensitive lining of the eye
__label__0 the fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells   link
__label__0 while cones are concentrated in the fovea  where images tend to be focused  rods  another type of photoreceptor  are located throughout the remainder of the retina
__label__1 rods are specialized photoreceptors that work well in low light conditions  and while they lack the spatial resolution and color function of the cones  they are involved in our vision in dimly lit environments as well as in our perception of movement on the periphery of our visual field
__label__1 the optic nerve from each eye merges just below the brain at a point called the optic chiasm
__label__0 as  link  shows  the optic chiasm is an x  shaped structure that sits just below the cerebral cortex at the front of the brain
__label__0 the trichromatic theory of color vision is not the only theory  another major theory of color vision is known as the opponent  process theory
__label__0 the chain termination method involves dna replication of a single  stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide  dntp   which is a monomer  or a single unit  of dna
__label__0 the primer and dntp are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides  ddntps
__label__1 the ddntps are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group   oh  at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain   link
__label__0 this was sufficient for sequencing small genomes
__label__0 however  the desire to sequence larger genomes  such as that of a human  led to the development of double  barrel shotgun sequencing  more formally known as pairwise  end sequencing
__label__1 in pairwise  end sequencing  both ends of each fragment are analyzed for overlap
__label__0 having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms
__label__1 the process of attaching biological information to gene sequences is called genome annotation
__label__0 annotation of gene sequences helps with basic experiments in molecular biology  such as designing pcr primers and rna targets
__label__0 although mrna analysis is a step in the right direction  not all mrnas are translated into proteins
__label__1 the study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics
__label__0 proteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes
__label__0 such defects only account for approximately  percent of diseases in developed countries
__label__1 most of the common diseases  such as heart disease  are multi  factored or polygenic  which is a phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes  and also involve environmental factors such as diet
__label__0 in april   scientists at stanford university published the genome analysis of a healthy individual  stephen quake  a scientist at stanford university  who had his genome sequenced   the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases
__label__1 a heritable trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation
__label__0 scientists describe groups of organisms becoming adapted to their environment when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the  fit  of the population to its environment
__label__1 over time  evolution led to changes in the shapes and sizes of these bones in different species  but they have maintained the same overall layout
__label__0 scientists call these synonymous parts homologous structures
__label__1 a species is a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile  viable offspring
__label__0 according to this definition  one species is distinguished from another when  in nature  it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring
__label__0 biologists have proposed mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories
__label__1 allopatric speciation  allo
__label__1 sympatric speciation  sym
__label__1 over time  the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species
__label__0 this is called adaptive radiation because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin  thus  causing the species to radiate into several new ones
__label__0 island archipelagos like the hawaiian islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms
__label__0 given enough time  the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction  if individuals of the two populations were to be brought together  mating would be less likely  but if mating occurred  offspring would be non  viable or infertile
__label__1 many types of diverging characters may affect the reproductive isolation  the ability to interbreed  of the two populations
__label__0 many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year  often just annually
__label__1 differences in breeding schedules  called temporal isolation  can act as a form of reproductive isolation
__label__0 for example  two species of frogs inhabit the same area  but one reproduces from january to march  whereas the other reproduces from march to may   link
__label__0 these two related frog species exhibit temporal reproductive isolation
__label__1 other prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells  eggs and sperm  prevent fertilization from taking place  this is called a gametic barrier
__label__0 similarly  in some cases closely related organisms try to mate  but their reproductive structures simply do not fit together
__label__1 in sum  the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes  such as natural selection  can affect a population s genetic makeup  and  in turn  how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species
__label__1 the theory also connects this change of a population over time  called microevolution  with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters  called macroevolution
__label__0 some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way  meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele  while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool
__label__1 the gene pool is the sum of all the alleles in a population
__label__1 populations with two or more variations of particular characteristics are called polymorphic
__label__1 the distribution of phenotypes among individuals  known as the population variation  is influenced by a number of factors  including the population s genetic structure and the environment   link
__label__0 understanding the sources of a phenotypic variation in a population is important for determining how a population will evolve in response to different evolutionary pressures
__label__0 when scientists are involved in the breeding of a species  such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves  they try to increase a population s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can
__label__1 this also helps reduce the risks associated with inbreeding  the mating of closely related individuals  which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease
__label__0 for example  a disease that is caused by a rare  recessive allele might exist in a population  but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the allele
__label__0 another way a population s allele and genotype frequencies can change is genetic drift   link    which is simply the effect of chance
__label__1 by chance  some individuals will have more offspring than others  not due to an advantage conferred by some genetically  encoded trait  but just because one male happened to be in the right place at the right time  when the receptive female walked by  or because the other one happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time  when a fox was hunting
__label__0 if individuals nonrandomly mate with their peers  the result can be a changing population
__label__0 there are many reasons nonrandom mating occurs
__label__0 one reason is simple mate choice  for example  female peahens may prefer peacocks with bigger  brighter tails
__label__0 such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant
__label__1 one type of geographic variation  called a cline  can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient
__label__0 species of warm  blooded animals  for example  tend to have larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the earth s poles  allowing them to better conserve heat
__label__1 however  it is not the absolute fitness of an individual that counts  but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population
__label__0 this concept  called relative fitness  allows researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation  and thus  how the population might evolve
__label__1 sometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages and be selected for by natural selection  while the intermediate phenotypes are  on average  less fit
__label__0 known as diversifying selection   link    this is seen in many populations of animals that have multiple male forms
__label__0 large  dominant alpha males obtain mates by brute force  while small males can sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male s territory
__label__0 the speculation is that large tails carry risk  and only the best males survive that risk  the bigger the tail  the more fit the male
__label__0 this idea is known as the handicap principle
__label__1 in scientific terms  the evolutionary history and relationship of an organism or group of organisms is called its phylogeny
__label__0 a phylogeny describes the relationships of an organism  such as from which organisms it is thought to have evolved  to which species it is most closely related  and so forth
__label__0 in a rooted tree  the branching indicates evolutionary relationships   link
__label__1 the point where a split occurs  called a branch point  represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one
__label__1 a lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon
__label__1 when two lineages stem from the same branch point  they are called sister taxa
__label__1 a branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships
__label__0 it is important to note that although sister taxa and polytomy do share an ancestor  it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from each other
__label__1 for example  after the common beginning of all life  scientists divide organisms into three large categories called a domain  bacteria  archaea  and eukarya
__label__1 within each domain is a second category called a kingdom
__label__0 after kingdoms  the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are  phylum  class  order  family  genus  and species   link
__label__0 therefore  the scientific name of the dog is canis lupus
__label__1 the name at each level is also called a taxon
__label__0 in other words  dogs are in order carnivora
__label__0 how do scientists construct phylogenetic trees
__label__0 after the homologous and analogous traits are sorted  scientists often organize the homologous traits using a system called cladistics
__label__1 this system sorts organisms into clades  groups of organisms that descended from a single ancestor
__label__1 this system sorts organisms into clades  groups of organisms that descended from a single ancestor
__label__0 now consider the amniotic egg characteristic in the same figure
__label__1 only some of the organisms in  link  have this trait  and to those that do  it is called a shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree
__label__0 the tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the fact that these terms are relative
__label__0 the same trait can be considered one or the other depending on the particular diagram being used
__label__0 more recently  a fourth mechanism of gene transfer between prokaryotes has been discovered
__label__1 small  virus  like particles called gene transfer agents  gtas  transfer random genomic segments from one species of prokaryote to another
__label__0 gtas have been shown to be responsible for genetic changes  sometimes at a very high frequency compared to other evolutionary processes
__label__1 the nucleus  first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first   link  a   followed by a later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria
__label__1 the mitochondria  first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host   link  b   which subsequently acquired a nucleus  by fusion or other mechanisms  to become the first eukaryotic cell
__label__1 most interestingly  the eukaryote  first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity   link  c
__label__1 others have proposed abandoning any tree  like model of phylogeny in favor of a ring structure  the so  called  ring of life    link    a phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes
__label__1 lake  again using the conditioned reconstruction algorithm  proposes a ring  like model in which species of all three domains  archaea  bacteria  and eukarya  evolved from a single pool of gene  swapping prokaryotes
__label__0 they therefore lack most of the components of cells  such as organelles  ribosomes  and the plasma membrane
__label__1 a virion consists of a nucleic acid core  an outer protein coating or capsid  and sometimes an outer envelope made of protein and phospholipid membranes derived from the host cell
__label__0 viruses may also contain additional proteins  such as enzymes
__label__0 many viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to their host cells via molecules on the cell called viral receptors   link
__label__0 for these viruses  attachment is a requirement for later penetration of the cell membrane  so they can complete their replication inside the cell
__label__0 group i viruses contain double  stranded dna  dsdna  as their genome
__label__0 their mrna is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular dna
__label__0 the strands separate  and one of them is used as a template for the generation of mrna using the rna  dependent rna polymerase encoded by the virus
__label__0 group iv viruses have ssrna as their genome with a positive polarity
__label__0 positive polarity means that the genomic rna can serve directly as mrna
__label__0 multiple  full  length rna strands of negative polarity  complimentary to the positive  stranded genomic rna  are formed from these intermediates  which may then serve as templates for the production of rna with positive polarity  including both full  length genomic rna and shorter viral mrnas
__label__0 group v viruses contain ssrna genomes with a negative polarity  meaning that their sequence is complementary to the mrna
__label__0 as with group iv viruses  dsrna intermediates are used to make copies of the genome and produce mrna
__label__0 viruses can infect only certain species of hosts and only certain cells within that host
__label__1 cells that a virus may use to replicate are called permissive
__label__0 for most viruses  the molecular basis for this specificity is that a particular surface molecule known as the viral receptor must be found on the host cell surface for the virus to attach
__label__0 the symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus  which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body  and from cell damage caused by the virus
__label__1 many animal viruses  such as hiv  human immunodeficiency virus   leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as budding  where virions leave the cell individually
__label__0 during the budding process  the cell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed
__label__1 bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria   link
__label__1 when infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions  the infection is said to be productive
__label__1 if the virions are released by bursting the cell  the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle   link
__label__1 for example  when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell  it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle   link    and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell
__label__1 when the phage dna is incorporated into the host cell genome  it is called a prophage
__label__0 an example of a lysogenic bacteriophage is the   lambda  virus  which also infects the e
__label__0 as you will learn in the next module  animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases
__label__1 some of them follow the classic pattern of acute disease  where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period followed by the elimination of the virus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the infection
__label__0 examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza
__label__1 some animal  infecting viruses  including the hepatitis c virus discussed above  are known as oncogenic viruses  they have the ability to cause cancer
__label__1 these viruses interfere with the normal regulation of the host cell cycle either by either introducing genes that stimulate unregulated cell growth  oncogenes  or by interfering with the expression of genes that inhibit cell growth
__label__0 these viruses interfere with the normal regulation of the host cell cycle either by either introducing genes that stimulate unregulated cell growth  oncogenes  or by interfering with the expression of genes that inhibit cell growth
__label__1 one common symptom is hyperplasia  the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls
__label__1 other viruses induce hypoplasia  or decreased cell growth  in the leaves of plants  causing thin  yellow areas to appear
__label__1 still other viruses affect the plant by directly killing plant cells  a process known as cell necrosis
__label__0 the danger of using live vaccines  which are usually more effective than killed vaccines  is the low but significant danger that these viruses will revert to their disease  causing form by back mutations
__label__0 live vaccines are usually made by attenuating  weakening  the  wild  type   disease  causing  virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host
__label__0 another medical use for viruses relies on their specificity and ability to kill the cells they infect
__label__1 oncolytic viruses are engineered in the laboratory specifically to attack and kill cancer cells
__label__0 a genetically modified adenovirus known as h has been used since  in clinical trials in china to treat head and neck cancers
__label__1 prions  so  called because they are proteinaceous  are infectious particles  smaller than viruses  that contain no nucleic acids  neither dna nor rna
__label__0 historically  the idea of an infectious agent that did not use nucleic acids was considered impossible  but pioneering work by nobel prize  winning biologist stanley prusiner has convinced the majority of biologists that such agents do indeed exist
__label__0 some prokaryotes thrive in environments that are inhospitable for most living things
__label__1 prokaryotes recycle nutrients  essential substances  such as carbon and nitrogen   and they drive the evolution of new ecosystems  some of which are natural and others man  made
__label__0 prokaryotes have been on earth since long before multicellular life appeared
__label__1 therefore  only those organisms that can grow without oxygen  anaerobic organisms  were able to live
__label__1 autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs  and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of earth
__label__0 then  cyanobacteria  also known as blue  green algae  evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later
__label__1 for example  a soda lake is both salty and alkaline  so organisms that live in a soda lake must be both alkaliphiles and halophiles   link
__label__0 other extremophiles  like radioresistant organisms  do not prefer an extreme environment  in this case  one with high levels of radiation   but have adapted to survive in it   link
__label__0 this model  however  does not reflect the true ecology of prokaryotes  most of which prefer to live in communities where they can interact
__label__1 a biofilm is a microbial community   link   held together in a gummy  textured matrix that consists primarily of polysaccharides secreted by the organisms  together with some proteins and nucleic acids
__label__0 biofilms grow attached to surfaces
__label__1 bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan  composed of polysaccharide chains that are cross  linked by unusual peptides containing both l  and d  amino acids including d  glutamic acid and d  alanine
__label__0 proteins normally have only l  amino acids  as a consequence  many of our antibiotics work by mimicking d  amino acids and therefore have specific effects on bacterial cell wall development
__label__0 gram  positive organisms typically lack the outer membrane found in gram  negative organisms   link
__label__0 up to  percent of the cell wall in gram  positive bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan  and most of the rest is composed of acidic substances called teichoic acids
__label__0 teichoic acids may be covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane to form lipoteichoic acids
__label__0 if a nonpathogenic bacterium takes up dna for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new dna into its own chromosome  it too may become pathogenic
__label__1 in transduction  bacteriophages  the viruses that infect bacteria  sometimes also move short pieces of chromosomal dna from one bacterium to another
__label__0 transduction results in a recombinant organism
__label__0 the largest pool of nitrogen available in the terrestrial ecosystem is gaseous nitrogen from the air  but this nitrogen is not usable by plants  which are primary producers
__label__1 gaseous nitrogen is transformed  or  fixed  into more readily available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen fixation
__label__1 ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms  another source of ammonia is ammonification  the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen  containing organic compounds
__label__0 nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria belonging to the genera nitrosomas  nitrobacter  and nitrospira
__label__1 the bacteria performs the reverse process  the reduction of nitrate from the soils to gaseous compounds such as no  no  and n  a process called denitrification

__label__1 a pandemic is a widespread  usually worldwide  epidemic
__label__1 an endemic disease is a disease that is constantly present  usually at low incidence  in a population
__label__0 researchers have expressed concern about the way this latter source of mrsa targets a much younger population than those residing in care facilities
__label__0 the journal of the american medical association reported that  among mrsa  afflicted persons in healthcare facilities  the average age is   whereas people with  community  associated mrsa   ca  mrsa  have an average age of this scanning electron micrograph shows methicillin  resistant staphylococcus aureus bacteria  commonly known as mrsa

__label__1 amoebas and some other heterotrophic protist species ingest particles by a process called phagocytosis  in which the cell membrane engulfs a food particle and brings it inward  pinching off an intracellular membranous sac  or vesicle  called a food vacuole   link
__label__1 amoebas and some other heterotrophic protist species ingest particles by a process called phagocytosis  in which the cell membrane engulfs a food particle and brings it inward  pinching off an intracellular membranous sac  or vesicle  called a food vacuole   link
__label__0 the vesicle containing the ingested particle  the phagosome  then fuses with a lysosome containing hydrolytic enzymes to produce a phagolysosome  and the food particle is broken down into small molecules that can diffuse into the cytoplasm and be used in cellular metabolism
__label__0 undigested remains ultimately are expelled from the cell via exocytosis  the stages of phagocytosis include the engulfment of a food particle  the digestion of the particle using hydrolytic enzymes contained within a lysosome  and the expulsion of undigested materials from the cell
__label__0 a second excavata subgroup  the parabasalids  also exhibits semi  functional mitochondria
__label__0 in parabasalids  these structures function anaerobically and are called hydrogenosomes because they produce hydrogen gas as a byproduct
__label__0 parabasalids move with flagella and membrane rippling
__label__1 as a result  the carbon dioxide that the diatoms had consumed and incorporated into their cells during photosynthesis is not returned to the atmosphere
__label__0 in general  this process by which carbon is transported deep into the ocean is described as the biological carbon pump  because carbon is  pumped  to the ocean depths where it is inaccessible to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide
__label__0 the biological carbon pump is a crucial component of the carbon cycle that maintains lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels
__label__0 the vegetative body of a fungus is a unicellular or multicellular thallus
__label__0 dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular to multicellular state depending on environmental conditions
__label__1 the vegetative stage consists of a tangle of slender thread  like structures called hyphae  singular  hypha   whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous
__label__1 the mass of hyphae is a mycelium   link
__label__0 it can grow on a surface  in soil or decaying material  in a liquid  or even on living tissue
__label__1 fungi are mostly saprobes  saprophyte is an equivalent term   organisms that derive nutrients from decaying organic matter
__label__0 they obtain their nutrients from dead or decomposing organic matter  mainly plant material
__label__0 during sexual reproduction  two mating types are produced
__label__1 when both mating types are present in the same mycelium  it is called homothallic  or self  fertile
__label__1 heterothallic mycelia require two different  but compatible  mycelia to reproduce sexually
__label__1 first  during plasmogamy  literally   marriage or union of cytoplasm    two haploid cells fuse  leading to a dikaryotic stage where two haploid nuclei coexist in a single cell
__label__1 during karyogamy   nuclear marriage    the haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote nucleus
__label__1 finally  meiosis takes place in the gametangia  singular  gametangium  organs  in which gametes of different mating types are generated
__label__0 two opposing mating strains  type  and type   must be in close proximity for gametangia from the hyphae to be produced and fuse  leading to karyogamy
__label__0 the developing diploid zygospores have thick coats that protect them from desiccation and other hazards
__label__0 they may remain dormant until environmental conditions are favorable
__label__0 the fungi in the phylum basidiomycota are easily recognizable under a light microscope by their club  shaped fruiting bodies called basidia  singular  basidium   which are the swollen terminal cell of a hypha
__label__1 the basidia  which are the reproductive organs of these fungi  are often contained within the familiar mushroom  commonly seen in fields after rain  on the supermarket shelves  and growing on your lawn   link
__label__1 parasitism describes a symbiotic relationship in which one member of the association benefits at the expense of the other
__label__0 both parasites and pathogens harm the host  however  the pathogen causes a disease  whereas the parasite usually does not
__label__0 fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues
__label__1 mycotoxicosis is the poisoning of humans  and other animals  by foods contaminated by fungal toxins  mycotoxins
__label__1 mycetismus describes the ingestion of preformed toxins in poisonous mushrooms
__label__0 there are a number of types of mycorrhizae
__label__1 ectomycorrhizae   outside  mycorrhiza  depend on fungi enveloping the roots in a sheath  called a mantle  and a hartig net of hyphae that extends into the roots between cells   link
__label__1 ectomycorrhizae   outside  mycorrhiza  depend on fungi enveloping the roots in a sheath  called a mantle  and a hartig net of hyphae that extends into the roots between cells   link
__label__0 the fungal partner can belong to the ascomycota  basidiomycota or zygomycota
__label__0 both the fungus and the alga participate in the formation of dispersal units for reproduction
__label__0 lichens produce soredia  clusters of algal cells surrounded by mycelia
__label__0 soredia are dispersed by wind and water and form new lichens
__label__1 the term  sporangia  literally means  spore in a vessel   as it is a reproductive sac that contains spores  link
__label__1 inside the multicellular sporangia  the diploid sporocytes  or mother cells  produce haploid spores by meiosis  where the n chromosome number is reduced to n  note that many plant sporophytes are polyploid  for example  durum wheat is tetraploid  bread wheat is hexaploid  and some ferns are   ploid
__label__0 the spores are later released by the sporangia and disperse in the environment
__label__1 in contrast  heterosporous plants produce two morphologically different types of spores
__label__1 the male spores are called microspores  because of their smaller size  and develop into the male gametophyte  the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte
__label__0 heterospory is observed in a few seedless vascular plants and in all seed plants
__label__1 gametangia  singular  gametangium  are structures observed on multicellular haploid gametophytes
__label__0 in the gametangia  precursor cells give rise to gametes by mitosis
__label__1 paleobotanists distinguish between extinct species  as fossils  and extant species  which are still living
__label__1 the extinct vascular plants  classified as zosterophylls and trimerophytes  most probably lacked true leaves and roots and formed low vegetation mats similar in size to modern  day mosses  although some trimetophytes could reach one meter in height
__label__0 liverworts  hepaticophyta  are viewed as the plants most closely related to the ancestor that moved to land
__label__0 liverworts have colonized every terrestrial habitat on earth and diversified to more than  existing species   link
__label__0 more than  species of mosses have been catalogued
__label__0 their habitats vary from the tundra  where they are the main vegetation  to the understory of tropical forests
__label__1 the slender seta  plural  setae   as seen in  link   contains tubular cells that transfer nutrients from the base of the sporophyte  the foot  to the sporangium or capsule
__label__1 the slender seta  plural  setae   as seen in  link   contains tubular cells that transfer nutrients from the base of the sporophyte  the foot  to the sporangium or capsule
__label__0 the simplest arrangement of conductive cells shows a pattern of xylem at the center surrounded by phloem
__label__1 xylem is the tissue responsible for the storage and long  distance transport of water and nutrients  as well as the transfer of water  soluble growth factors from the organs of synthesis to the target organs
__label__1 the tissue consists of conducting cells  known as tracheids  and supportive filler tissue  called parenchyma
__label__0 the existence of two types of morphology suggests that leaves evolved independently in several groups of plants
__label__0 the first type of leaf is the microphyll  or  little leaf   which can be dated to  million years ago in the late silurian
__label__1 a microphyll is small and has a simple vascular system
__label__0 in addition to photosynthesis  leaves play another role in the life of the plants
__label__1 pine cones  mature fronds of ferns  and flowers are all sporophylls  leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia
__label__1 strobili are cone  like structures that contain sporangia
__label__0 phylum monilophyta  class equisetopsida  horsetails
__label__0 horsetails  whisk ferns and ferns belong to the phylum monilophyta  with horsetails placed in the class equisetopsida
__label__1 the single genus equisetum is the survivor of a large group of plants  known as arthrophyta  which produced large trees and entire swamp forests in the carboniferous
__label__0 the stem may be buried underground as a rhizome  from which adventitious roots grow to absorb water and nutrients from the soil  or  they may grow above ground as a trunk in tree ferns   link
__label__1 adventitious organs are those that grow in unusual places  such as roots growing from the side of a stem
__label__1 sporophylls are specialized leaves that produce sporangia
__label__1 the term strobilus  plural  strobili  describes a tight arrangement of sporophylls around a central stalk  as seen in cones
__label__0 some seeds are enveloped by sporophyte tissues upon maturation
__label__0 like all gymnosperms  pines are heterosporous and generate two different types of spores  male microspores and female megaspores
__label__0 in the male cones  or staminate cones  the microsporocytes give rise to pollen grains by meiosis
__label__0 in the spring  large amounts of yellow pollen are released and carried by the wind
__label__1 conifers are the dominant phylum of gymnosperms  with the most variety of species   link
__label__0 specifically for the strong nuclear force  yukawa proposed that a previously unknown particle  now called a pion  is exchanged between nucleons  transmitting the force between them
__label__0 link  illustrates how a pion would carry a force between a proton and a neutron
__label__0 feynman diagrams are not only a useful tool for visualizing interactions at the quantum mechanical level  they are also used to calculate details of interactions  such as their strengths and probability of occurring
__label__1 feynman was one of the theorists who developed the field of quantum electrodynamics  qed   which is the quantum mechanics of electromagnetism
__label__0 qed has been spectacularly successful in describing electromagnetic interactions on the submicroscopic scale
__label__0 several hints related to an underlying substructure emerge from an examination of these particle characteristics
__label__0 note that the carrier particles are called gauge bosons
__label__1 first mentioned in patterns in spectra reveal more quantization  a boson is a particle with zero or an integer value of intrinsic spin  such as s         s         size   s
__label__0 in   the tau    size        was discovered  and a third family of leptons emerged as seen in  link
__label__0 theorists quickly proposed two more quark flavors called top  t  or truth and bottom  b  or beauty to keep the number of quarks the same as the number of leptons
__label__0 and in   the upsilon
__label__0 it is beyond the scope of this text to go into more detail on the types of quark and gluon interactions that underlie the observable particles  but the theory  quantum chromodynamics or qcd  is very self  consistent
__label__1 so successful have qcd and the electroweak theory been that  taken together  they are called the standard model
__label__0 even more extreme are the energies and distances at which gravity is thought to unify with the other forces in a toe
__label__0 most speculative and least constrained by experiment are toes  one of which is called superstring theory
__label__1 superstrings are entities that are    m    m size
__label__0 at the energy of guts  the carrier particles of the weak force would become massless and identical to gluons
__label__0 he then found that all but the closest galaxies have a red shift in their hydrogen spectra that is proportional to their distance
__label__0 the explanation is that there is a cosmological red shift due to the expansion of space itself
__label__0 the photon wavelength is stretched in transit from the source to the observer
__label__0 many aspects of general relativity have been verified experimentally  some of which are better than science fiction in that they are bizarre but true
__label__1 quantum gravity is the theory that deals with particle exchange of gravitons as the mechanism for the force  and with extreme conditions where quantum mechanics and general relativity must both be used
__label__0 a good theory of quantum gravity does not yet exist  but one will be needed to understand how all four forces may be unified
__label__1 black holesblack holes are objects having such large gravitational fields that things can fall in  but nothing  not even light  can escape
__label__0 bodies  like the earth or the sun  have what is called an escape velocity
__label__1 if an object moves straight up from the body  starting at the escape velocity  it will just be able to escape the gravity of the body
__label__0 the greater the acceleration of gravity on the body  the greater is the escape velocity
__label__0 supporting this is the fact that very distant galaxies are more likely to have abnormally energetic cores
__label__1 some of the moderately distant galaxies  and hence among the younger  are known as quasars and emit as much or more energy than a normal galaxy but from a region less than a light year across
__label__0 quasar energy outputs may vary in times less than a year  so that the energy  emitting region must be less than a light year across
__label__0 the motion of stars in galaxies and the motion of galaxies in clusters imply that there is about  times as much mass as in the luminous objects we can see
__label__1 the indirectly observed non  luminous matter is called dark matter
__label__0 why is dark matter a problem
__label__0 this means that you can in principle travel an unlimited distance in any direction
__label__1 a universe that is closed is called positively curved
__label__0 this means that if you travel far enough in any direction  you will return to your starting point  analogous to circumnavigating the earth
__label__0 searches for dark matter in this form are particularly interested in galactic halos because of the huge amount of mass that seems to be there
__label__0 such microlensing objects are thus called massive compact halo objects  or machos
__label__0 to date  a few machos have been observed  but not predominantly in galactic halos  nor in the numbers needed to explain dark matter
__label__0 these are called weakly interacting massive particles  or wimps  and would also be chargeless  thus interacting negligibly with normal matter  except through gravitation
__label__1 one proposed group of wimps would have masses several orders of magnitude greater than nucleons and are sometimes called neutralinos
__label__0 others are called axions and would have masses about       size
__label__1 superconductors are materials with a resistivity of zero
__label__0 they are familiar to the general public because of their practical applications and have been mentioned at a number of points in the text
__label__0 there is constructive interference along the lines shown  a cone in three dimensions  from similar sound waves arriving there simultaneously
__label__1 this superposition forms a disturbance called a sonic boom  a constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound
__label__0 inside the cone  the interference is mostly destructive  and so the sound intensity there is much less than on the shock wave
__label__0 an early accelerator is a relatively simple  large  scale version of the electron gun
__label__0 the van de graaff  named after the dutch physicist   which you have likely seen in physics demonstrations  is a small version of the ones used for nuclear research since their invention for that purpose in
__label__0 for more  see  link
__label__0 still limited by achievable magnetic field strengths  synchrotrons need to be very large at very high energies  since the radius of a high  energy particle s orbit is very large
__label__1 radiation caused by a magnetic field accelerating a charged particle perpendicular to its velocity is called synchrotron radiation in honor of its importance in these machines
__label__0 the adrenal cortex is made up of layers of epithelial cells and associated capillary networks
__label__0 these layers form three distinct regions  an outer zona glomerulosa that produces mineralocorticoids  a middle zona fasciculata that produces glucocorticoids  and an inner zona reticularis that produces androgens
__label__1 the endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of langerhans  as visible in the micrograph shown in  link
__label__0 the pancreatic islets contain two primary cell types  alpha cells  which produce the hormone glucagon  and beta cells  which produce the hormone insulin
__label__0 while the adrenal glands associated with the kidneys are major endocrine glands  the kidneys themselves also possess endocrine function
__label__0 renin is released in response to decreased blood volume or pressure and is part of the renin  angiotensin  aldosterone system that leads to the release of aldosterone
__label__0 as blood osmolarity decreases  a negative feedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor activity in the hypothalamus  and adh secretion is reduced
__label__0 adh release can be reduced by certain substances  including alcohol  which can cause increased urine production and dehydration
__label__0 chronic underproduction of adh or a mutation in the adh receptor results in diabetes insipidus
__label__0 if the posterior pituitary does not release enough adh  water can not be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine
__label__0 fsh production is inhibited by the hormone inhibin  which is released by the testes
__label__0 lh stimulates production of the sex hormones  androgens  by the interstitial cells of the testes and therefore is also called interstitial cell  stimulating hormone
__label__0 prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin  releasing hormone  prh  and prolactin  inhibiting hormone  pih   which is now known to be dopamine
__label__0 prh stimulates the release of prolactin and pih inhibits it  the posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin  which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth
__label__0 the uterine smooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the uterus peaks
__label__0 this can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas  or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin
__label__1 this prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells  causing high levels of blood glucose  or hyperglycemia  high sugar
__label__0 high blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover all the glucose from nascent urine  resulting in glucose being lost in urine
__label__0 when blood glucose levels decline below normal levels  for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly during exercise  the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas
__label__1 glucagon raises blood glucose levels  eliciting what is called a hyperglycemic effect  by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in skeletal muscle cells and liver cells in a process called glycogenolysis
__label__0 glucose can then be utilized as energy by muscle cells and released into circulation by the liver cells
__label__0 t and t release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroid  stimulating hormone  tsh   which is produced by the anterior pituitary
__label__0 tsh binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production of t and t from a glycoprotein called thyroglobulin
__label__0 disorders can arise from both the underproduction and overproduction of thyroid hormones
__label__1 hypothyroidism  underproduction of the thyroid hormones  can cause a low metabolic rate leading to weight gain  sensitivity to cold  and reduced mental activity  among other symptoms
__label__0 in children  hypothyroidism can cause cretinism  which can lead to mental retardation and growth defects
__label__0 the hormone calcitonin  which is produced by the parafollicular or c cells of the thyroid  has the opposite effect on blood calcium levels as does pth
__label__1 calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclasts  stimulating osteoblasts  and stimulating calcium excretion by the kidneys
__label__0 blood glucose levels increase as most tissues are utilizing fatty acids instead of glucose for their energy needs
__label__1 the gh mediated increase in blood glucose levels is called a diabetogenic effect because it is similar to the high blood glucose levels seen in diabetes mellitus
__label__1 the indirect mechanism of gh action is mediated by insulin  like growth factors  igfs  or somatomedins  which are a family of growth  promoting proteins produced by the liver  which stimulates tissue growth
__label__0 igfs stimulate the uptake of amino acids from the blood  allowing the formation of new proteins  particularly in skeletal muscle cells  cartilage cells  and other target cells  as shown in  link
__label__0 in some cases  individuals are under  inches in height
__label__0 oversecretion of growth hormone can lead to gigantism in children  causing excessive growth
__label__0 in some documented cases  individuals can reach heights of over eight feet
__label__1 stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla  which mediates short  term stress responses  via nerve impulses  and the adrenal cortex  which mediates long  term stress responses  via the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone  acth   which is produced by the anterior pituitary
__label__0 short  term stress responsewhen presented with a stressful situation  the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst of energy
__label__0 the hormones epinephrine  also known as adrenaline  and norepinephrine  also known as noradrenaline  are released by the adrenal medulla
__label__0 how do these hormones provide a burst of energy
__label__0 fsh stimulates egg maturation in females  while lh stimulates the production of estrogens and progesterone
__label__1 estrogens are a group of steroid hormones produced by the ovaries that trigger the development of secondary sex characteristics in females as well as control the maturation of the ova
__label__0 in females  the pituitary also produces prolactin  which stimulates milk production after childbirth  and oxytocin  which stimulates uterine contraction during childbirth and milk let  down during suckling
__label__1 insulin is produced by the pancreas in response to rising blood glucose levels and allows cells to utilize blood glucose and store excess glucose for later use
__label__1 an endoskeleton is a skeleton that consists of hard  mineralized structures located within the soft tissue of organisms

__label__1 the scapulae are flat  triangular bones that are located at the back of the pectoral girdle
__label__0 they support the muscles crossing the shoulder joint
__label__0 it articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow
__label__1 the forearm extends from the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones  the ulna and the radius
__label__1 the radius is located along the lateral  thumb  side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow
__label__0 the radius and ulna also articulate with the carpal bones and with each other  which in vertebrates enables a variable degree of rotation of the carpus with respect to the long axis of the limb
__label__0 the hand includes the eight bones of the carpus  wrist   the five bones of the metacarpus  palm   and the  bones of the phalanges  digits

__label__1 the bones of the lower limb are the femur  thigh bone   patella  kneecap   tibia and fibula  bones of the leg   tarsals  bones of the ankle   and metatarsals and phalanges  bones of the foot    link
__label__0 it improves knee extension by reducing friction
__label__1 the tibia  or shinbone  is a large bone of the leg that is located directly below the knee
__label__0 the tibia articulates with the femur at its proximal end  with the fibula and the tarsal bones at its distal end
__label__0 the ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the fibula to the foot
__label__1 the metatarsals are the five bones of the foot
__label__1 the phalanges are the  bones of the toes
__label__0 there are three types of fibrous joints  sutures  syndesmoses  and gomphoses
__label__1 sutures are found only in the skull and possess short fibers of connective tissue that hold the skull bones tightly in place   link
__label__1 cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage
__label__0 there are two types of cartilaginous joints  synchondroses and symphyses
__label__1 synovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones   link
__label__1 synovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones   link
__label__0 this space is referred to as the synovial  or joint  cavity and is filled with synovial fluid
__label__1 amphiarthroses are joints that allow slight movement  including syndesmoses and symphyses
__label__1 diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of the joint  as in synovial joints
__label__0 there are several different types of angular movements  including flexion  extension  hyperextension  abduction  adduction  and circumduction
__label__1 flexion  or bending  occurs when the angle between the bones decreases
__label__0 moving the forearm upward at the elbow or moving the wrist to move the hand toward the forearm are examples of flexion
__label__1 abduction occurs when a bone moves away from the midline of the body
__label__0 examples of abduction are moving the arms or legs laterally to lift them straight out to the side
__label__1 rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its longitudinal axis
__label__0 rotation can be toward the midline of the body  which is referred to as medial rotation  or away from the midline of the body  which is referred to as lateral rotation
__label__1 inversion involves the soles of the feet moving inward  toward the midline of the body
__label__1 eversion is the opposite of inversion  movement of the sole of the foot outward  away from the midline of the body
__label__1 protraction is the anterior movement of a bone in the horizontal plane
__label__0 protraction and retraction can be seen in the movement of the mandible as the jaw is thrust outwards and then back inwards
__label__1 elevation is the movement of a bone upward  such as when the shoulders are shrugged  lifting the scapulae
__label__1 depression is the opposite of elevation  movement downward of a bone  such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position
__label__1 dorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee
__label__1 plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted  such as when standing on the toes
__label__1 supination is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward
__label__0 pronation is the opposite movement  in which the palm faces backward
__label__1 opposition is the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand  making it possible to grasp and hold objects
__label__1 pivot joints consist of the rounded end of one bone fitting into a ring formed by the other bone
__label__0 this structure allows rotational movement  as the rounded bone moves around its own axis
__label__1 ball  and  socket jointsball  and  socket joints possess a rounded  ball  like end of one bone fitting into a cuplike socket of another bone
__label__0 this organization allows the greatest range of motion  as all movement types are possible in all directions
__label__0 smooth muscle tissue occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines  stomach  and urinary bladder  and around passages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels
__label__1 smooth muscle has no striations  is not under voluntary control  has only one nucleus per cell  is tapered at both ends  and is called involuntary muscle
__label__1 the sarcolemma is the site of action potential conduction  which triggers muscle contraction
__label__1 within each muscle fiber are myofibrils  long cylindrical structures that lie parallel to the muscle fiber
__label__0 myofibrils run the entire length of the muscle fiber  and because they are only approximately  m in diameter  hundreds to thousands can be found inside one muscle fiber
__label__0 there are two main types of filaments  thick filaments and thin filaments  each has different compositions and locations
__label__0 thick filaments occur only in the a band of a myofibril
__label__0 thin filaments attach to a protein in the z disc called alpha  actinin and occur across the entire length of the i band and partway into the a band
__label__1 tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules  preventing cross  bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input
__label__1 troponin binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule  it also binds calcium ions
__label__1 bone  or osseous tissue  is a connective tissue that constitutes the endoskeleton
__label__0 it contains specialized cells and a matrix of mineral salts and collagen fibers
__label__1 long bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends
__label__1 the diaphysis  or central shaft  contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity
__label__1 the rounded ends  the epiphyses  are covered with articular cartilage and are filled with red bone marrow  which produces blood cells   link
__label__1 flat bones are thin and relatively broad bones that are found where extensive protection of organs is required or where broad surfaces of muscle attachment are required
__label__0 examples of flat bones are the sternum  breast bone   ribs  scapulae  shoulder blades   and the roof of the skull   link
__label__1 sutural bones are small  flat  irregularly shaped bones
__label__0 they may be found between the flat bones of the skull
__label__0 they are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone
__label__1 each osteon consists of lamellae  which are layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the haversian canal
__label__1 the haversian canal  osteonic canal  contains the bone s blood vessels and nerve fibers   link
__label__0 spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue
__label__1 instead  it consists of trabeculae  which are lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates
__label__0 red bone marrow is found between the trabuculae
__label__0 bone may also be resorbed for remodeling  if the applied stresses have changed
__label__1 osteocytes are mature bone cells and are the main cells in bony connective tissue  these cells can not divide
__label__0 osteocytes maintain normal bone structure by recycling the mineral salts in the bony matrix
__label__1 intramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes
__label__0 it is involved in the formation of the flat bones of the skull  the mandible  and the clavicles
__label__1 appositional growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bony tissue at the surface of bones
__label__1 osteoblasts at the bone surface secrete bone matrix  and osteoclasts on the inner surface break down bone
__label__1 from the nasal cavity  air passes through the pharynx  throat  and the larynx  voice box   as it makes its way to the trachea   link
__label__0 the main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of the body
__label__0 in the lungs  air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages  or bronchi
__label__0 air enters the lungs through the two primary  main  bronchi  singular  bronchus
__label__0 each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi  then into tertiary bronchi  which in turn divide  creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung
__label__0 they lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape
__label__0 as the passageways decrease in diameter  the relative amount of smooth muscle increases
__label__0 the terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles
__label__0 the respiratory bronchioles subdivide into several alveolar ducts
__label__0 the air that organisms breathe contains particulate matter such as dust  dirt  viral particles  and bacteria that can damage the lungs or trigger allergic immune responses
__label__0 the respiratory system contains several protective mechanisms to avoid problems or tissue damage
__label__0 at maximal capacity  an average lung can hold almost six liters of air  but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity
__label__0 air in the lungs is measured in terms of lung volumes and lung capacities   link  and  link
__label__1 volume measures the amount of air for one function  such as inhalation or exhalation
__label__0 it is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal
__label__1 conversely  the inspiratory reserve volume  irv  is the additional amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal inhalation
__label__1 the residual volume  rv  is the amount of air that is left after expiratory reserve volume is exhaled
__label__0 it is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume  tidal volume  and inspiratory reserve volume
__label__1 the inspiratory capacity  ic  is the amount of air that can be inhaled after the end of a normal expiration
__label__0 it is  therefore  the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume
__label__0 lung volumes are measured by a technique called spirometry
__label__1 an important measurement taken during spirometry is the forced expiratory volume  fev   which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung over a specific period  usually one second  fev
__label__0 gas exchange across the alveoliin the body  oxygen is used by cells of the body s tissues and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product
__label__1 the ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption is the respiratory quotient  rq
__label__0 rq varies between  and
__label__0 no muscles are contracting to expel the air
__label__0 each lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac
__label__1 the layer of tissue that covers the lung and dips into spaces is called the visceral pleura
__label__0 a second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax   link
__label__1 the number of breaths per minute is the respiratory rate
__label__0 on average  under non  exertion conditions  the human respiratory rate is    breaths  minute
__label__0 this surface tension is similar to the surface tension of water at the liquid  air interface of a water droplet that results in the bonding of the water molecules together
__label__1 surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins that works to reduce the surface tension that exists between the alveoli tissue and the air found within the alveoli
__label__0 by lowering the surface tension of the alveolar fluid  it reduces the tendency of alveoli to collapse
__label__0 examples of restrictive diseases are respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis
__label__0 in both diseases  the airways are less compliant and they are stiff or fibrotic
__label__0 it is also independent of cardiac output
__label__1 this is because of a phenomenon called recruitment  which is the process of opening airways that normally remain closed when cardiac output increases
__label__1 as cardiac output increases  the number of capillaries and arteries that are perfused  filled with blood  increases
__label__1 dead space is created when no ventilation andor perfusion takes place
__label__1 anatomical dead space or anatomical shunt  arises from an anatomical failure  while physiological dead space or physiological shunt  arises from a functional impairment of the lung or arteries
__label__1 the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin can be plotted as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood  x  axis  versus the relative hb  oxygen saturation  y  axis
__label__0 the resulting graph  an oxygen dissociation curve  is sigmoidal  or s  shaped   link
__label__0 as the partial pressure of oxygen increases  the hemoglobin becomes increasingly saturated with oxygen
__label__0 this is painful when it occurs
__label__1 thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in either the alpha or the beta subunit of hb
__label__0 patients with thalassemia produce a high number of red blood cells  but these cells have lower  than  normal levels of hemoglobin
__label__0 in this system  carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells
__label__0 carbonic anhydrase  ca  within the red blood cells quickly converts the carbon dioxide into carbonic acid  hco
__label__1 carbonic acid is an unstable intermediate molecule that immediately dissociates into bicarbonate ions
__label__0 as opposed to a closed system  arthropods  including insects  crustaceans  and most mollusks  have an open circulatory system  as illustrated in  link  b
__label__1 in an open circulatory system  the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is pumped into a cavity called a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the interstitial fluid
__label__1 in an open circulatory system  the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is pumped into a cavity called a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the interstitial fluid
__label__0 as the heart beats and the animal moves  the hemolymph circulates around the organs within the body cavity and then reenters the hearts through openings called ostia
__label__1 the atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re  oxygenated  this is called gill circulation
__label__1 the blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium  this is called systemic circulation
__label__0 this unidirectional flow of blood produces a gradient of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood around the fish s systemic circuit
__label__0 as shown in  link  b  amphibians have a three  chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two  chambered heart of fish
__label__1 the two atria  superior heart chambers  receive blood from the two different circuits  the lungs and the systems   and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart s ventricle  inferior heart chamber   which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation
__label__0 the advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body
__label__0 blood supports growth by distributing nutrients and hormones  and by removing waste
__label__0 blood plays a protective role by transporting clotting factors and platelets to prevent blood loss and transporting the disease  fighting agents or white blood cells to sites of infection
__label__1 the atria are the chambers that receive blood  and the ventricles are the chambers that pump blood
__label__1 the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava  which drains blood from the jugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms  as well as from the inferior vena cava which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs
__label__1 in addition  the right atrium receives blood from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself
__label__0 the left atrium then receives the oxygen  rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins
__label__1 this blood passes through the bicuspid valve or mitral valve  the atrioventricular valve on the left side of the heart  to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through aorta  the major artery of the body  taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body
__label__0 once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the aorta  the aortic semilunar valve  or aortic valve  closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle
__label__1 the myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall
__label__1 the outer layer of cells is called the epicardium  of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart  it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures
__label__0 the heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood
__label__1 atherosclerosis is the blockage of an artery by the buildup of fatty plaques
__label__0 because of the size  narrow  of the coronary arteries and their function in serving the heart itself  atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries
__label__0 the human heart beats over  times per day
__label__0 in each cardiac cycle  the heart contracts  systole   pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body  this is followed by a relaxation phase  diastole   where the heart fills with blood  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 the atria contract at the same time  forcing blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles
__label__0 the electrical impulses in the heart produce electrical currents that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using electrodes
__label__1 this information can be observed as an electrocardiogram  ecg   a recording of the electrical impulses of the cardiac muscle
__label__0 arterioles diverge into capillary beds
__label__0 capillary beds contain a large number   to   of capillaries that branch among the cells and tissues of the body
__label__1 capillaries are narrow  diameter tubes that can fit red blood cells through in single file and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients  waste  and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level
__label__0 in capillaries  this single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the endothelial cells and red blood cells  as well as the exchange site via endocytosis and exocytosis
__label__1 the movement of materials at the site of capillaries is regulated by vasoconstriction  narrowing of the blood vessels  and vasodilation  widening of the blood vessels  this is important in the overall regulation of blood pressure
__label__1 throughout the cardiac cycle  the blood continues to empty into the arterioles at a relatively even rate
__label__0 this resistance to blood flow is called peripheral resistance
__label__1 osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane
__label__1 osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance  osmotic balance  across membranes within the body s fluids  which are composed of water  plus electrolytes and non  electrolytes
__label__1 osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance  osmotic balance  across membranes within the body s fluids  which are composed of water  plus electrolytes and non  electrolytes
__label__1 an electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water
__label__1 the body s fluids include blood plasma  the cytosol within cells  and interstitial fluid  the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body
__label__0 the membranes of the body  such as the pleural  serous  and cell membranes  are semi  permeable membranes
__label__1 semi  permeable membranes are permeable  or permissive  to certain types of solutes and water
__label__1 the molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution
__label__1 the molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent
__label__0 if the solvent is water  one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water
__label__1 the kidneys  illustrated in  link   are a pair of bean  shaped structures that are located just below and posterior to the liver in the peritoneal cavity
__label__0 the adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands
__label__1 the outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia
__label__1 the second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule  which helps anchor the kidneys in place
__label__1 the third and innermost layer is the renal capsule
__label__1 the hilum is the concave part of the bean  shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney  it is also the point of exit for the ureters
__label__1 the renal cortex is granular due to the presence of nephrons  the functional unit of the kidney
__label__0 the medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses  called the renal pyramids
__label__0 there are  on average  eight renal pyramids in each kidney
__label__1 the renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the lobes of the kidney
__label__0 the renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney
__label__1 on the inside of the kidney  the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces  which further branch into the minor calyces
__label__1 the ureters are urine  bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder
__label__0 the renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys
__label__0 each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns  which supply the renal lobes
__label__0 the interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the arcuate arteries
__label__0 each kidney is made up of over one million nephrons that dot the renal cortex  giving it a granular appearance when sectioned sagittally
__label__0 there are two types of nephrons  cortical nephrons   percent   which are deep in the renal cortex  and juxtamedullary nephrons   percent   which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla
__label__0 a nephron consists of three parts  a renal corpuscle  a renal tubule  and the associated capillary network  which originates from the cortical radiate arteries
__label__1 the renal tubule is a long and convoluted structure that emerges from the glomerulus and can be divided into three parts based on function
__label__0 the first part is called the proximal convoluted tubule  pct  due to its proximity to the glomerulus  it stays in the renal cortex
__label__0 the second part is called the loop of henle  or nephritic loop  because it forms a loop  with descending and ascending limbs  that goes through the renal medulla
__label__0 the capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to be filtered
__label__1 the branch that enters the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole
__label__1 the branch that exits the glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole
__label__1 in cortical nephrons  the peritubular capillary network surrounds the pct and dct
__label__0 in juxtamedullary nephrons  the peritubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of henle and is called the vasa recta
__label__1 in juxtamedullary nephrons  the peritubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of henle and is called the vasa recta
__label__0 water is also reabsorbed during this step
__label__0 then  additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion  which is  in essence  the opposite process to tubular reabsorption
__label__0 the collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae
__label__0 the osmotic gradient increases as it moves deeper into the medulla
__label__0 because two sides of the loop of henle perform opposing functions  as illustrated in  link   it acts as a countercurrent multiplier
__label__0 the vasa recta around it acts as the countercurrent exchanger
__label__0 generally  you pick up on depth in these images even though the visual stimulus is d
__label__1 when we do this  we are relying on a number of monocular cues  or cues that require only one eye
__label__0 if you think you ca nt see depth with one eye  note that you do nt bump into things when using only one eye while walking  and  in fact  we have more monocular cues than binocular cues
__label__1 the outer ear includes the pinna  which is the visible part of the ear that protrudes from our heads  the auditory canal  and the tympanic membrane  or eardrum
__label__1 the outer ear includes the pinna  which is the visible part of the ear that protrudes from our heads  the auditory canal  and the tympanic membrane  or eardrum
__label__1 the middle ear contains three tiny bones known as the ossicles  which are named the malleus  or hammer   incus  or anvil   and the stapes  or stirrup
__label__1 the inner ear contains the semi  circular canals  which are involved in balance and movement  the vestibular sense   and the cochlea
__label__0 as the stapes presses into the oval window  the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move  which in turn stimulates hair cells  which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane
__label__1 the basilar membrane is a thin strip of tissue within the cochlea
__label__0 the ability to locate sound in our environments is an important part of hearing
__label__0 localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields
__label__1 interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head
__label__1 interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear   link
__label__0 certain brain areas monitor these differences to construct where along a horizontal axis a sound originates  grothe et al
__label__0 one disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is mnire s disease
__label__1 although not well understood  mnire s disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss  tinnitus  constant ringing or buzzing   vertigo  a sense of spinning   and an increase in pressure within the inner ear  semaan  megerian
__label__0 this kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids  but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option
__label__0 taste  gustation  and smell  olfaction  are called chemical senses because both have sensory receptors that respond to molecules in the food we eat or in the air we breathe
__label__0 there is a pronounced interaction between our chemical senses
__label__1 many species respond to chemical messages  known as pheromones  sent by another individual  wysocki  preti
__label__0 pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive status of a potential mate
__label__1 some individuals are born without the ability to feel pain
__label__0 this very rare genetic disorder is known as congenital insensitivity to pain  or congenital analgesia
__label__0 while those with congenital analgesia can detect differences in temperature and pressure  they can not experience pain
__label__1 wertheimer  and his assistants wolfgang khler and kurt koffka  who later became his partners  believed that perception involved more than simply combining sensory stimuli
__label__0 this belief led to a new movement within the field of psychology known as gestalt psychology
__label__0 the word gestalt literally means form or pattern  but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts
__label__0 we might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields
__label__0 according to this principle  things that are alike tend to be grouped together   link
__label__0 according to gestalt theorists  pattern perception  or our ability to discriminate among different figures and shapes  occurs by following the principles described above
__label__0 you probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world  but this is not always the case
__label__0 built from sensations  but influenced by our own experiences  biases  prejudices  and cultures  perceptions can be very different from person to person
__label__0 research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception
__label__0 for instance  several studies have demonstrated that non  black participants identify weapons faster and are more likely to identify non  weapons as weapons when the image of the weapon is paired with the image of a black person  payne    payne  shimizu   jacoby
__label__0 learning  like reflexes and instincts  allows an organism to adapt to its environment
__label__1 but unlike instincts and reflexes  learned behaviors involve change and experience  learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience
__label__0 in contrast to the innate behaviors discussed above  learning involves acquiring knowledge and skills through experience
__label__0 pavlov       a russian scientist  performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning   link
__label__0 as we discussed briefly in the previous section  classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and  consequently  to anticipate events
__label__0 ivan pavlov s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning
__label__1 the meat powder in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus  ucs   a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an organism
__label__1 the dogs  salivation was an unconditioned response  ucr   a natural  unlearned  reaction to a given stimulus
__label__0 before conditioning  think of the dogs  stimulus and response like this
__label__0 eventually  the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone  just as they previously had salivated at the sound of the assistants  footsteps
__label__1 the behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditioned response  cr
__label__0 in the case of pavlov s dogs  they had learned to associate the tone  cs  with being fed  and they began to salivate  cr  in anticipation of food
__label__1 taste aversion is a type of conditioning in which an interval of several hours may pass between the conditioned stimulus  something ingested  and the unconditioned stimulus  nausea or illness
__label__0 here s how it works
__label__0 animals  including humans  need to distinguish between stimuli  for example  between sounds that predict a threatening event and sounds that do not  so that they can respond appropriately  such as running away if the sound is threatening
__label__1 when an organism learns to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar  it is called stimulus discrimination
__label__0 in classical conditioning terms  the organism demonstrates the conditioned response only to the conditioned stimulus
__label__0 john b watson  shown in  link   is considered the founder of behaviorism
__label__1 behaviorism is a school of thought that arose during the first part of the th century  which incorporates elements of pavlov s classical conditioning  hunt
__label__0 skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the behavior  the reinforcements and punishments
__label__0 his idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect  which was first proposed by psychologist edward thorndike
__label__1 according to the law of effect  behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated  and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated  thorndike
__label__1 in negative reinforcement  an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior
__label__0 for example  car manufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems  which go  beep  beep  beep  until you fasten your seatbelt
__label__0 in this case  a stimulus  the reprimand  is added in order to decrease the behavior  texting in class
__label__1 in negative punishment  you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease behavior
__label__0 for example  when a child misbehaves  a parent can take away a favorite toy
__label__1 a secondary reinforcer has no inherent value and only has reinforcing qualities when linked with a primary reinforcer
__label__0 praise  linked to affection  is one example of a secondary reinforcer  as when you called out  great shot   every time joaquin made a goal
__label__0 now let s combine these four terms
__label__1 a fixed interval reinforcement schedule is when behavior is rewarded after a set amount of time
__label__0 for example  june undergoes major surgery in a hospital
__label__1 in a variable ratio reinforcement schedule  the number of responses needed for a reward varies
__label__0 this is the most powerful partial reinforcement schedule
__label__0 as soon as the rats became aware of the food  they were able to find their way through the maze quickly  just as quickly as the comparison group  which had been rewarded with food all along
__label__1 this is known as latent learning  learning that occurs but is not observable in behavior until there is a reason to demonstrate it  psychologist edward tolman found that rats use cognitive maps to navigate through a maze
__label__0 have you ever worked your way through various levels on a video game
__label__0 imitation is much more obvious in humans  but is imitation really the sincerest form of flattery
__label__0 consider claire s experience with observational learning
__label__1 on the other hand  if you observed the model being punished  you would be less motivated to copy her
__label__0 this is called vicarious punishment
__label__0 for example  imagine that four  year  old allison watched her older sister kaitlyn playing in their mother s makeup  and then saw kaitlyn get a time out when their mother came in
__label__1 cognitive psychology is the field of psychology dedicated to examining how people think
__label__0 it attempts to explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking  emotion  creativity  language  and problem solving  in addition to other cognitive processes
__label__0 in psychology  concepts can be divided into two categories  natural and artificial
__label__1 natural concepts are created  naturally  through your experiences and can be developed from either direct or indirect experiences
__label__0 for example  if you live in essex junction  vermont  you have probably had a lot of direct experience with snow
__label__0 there are several types of schemata
__label__1 a role schema makes assumptions about how individuals in certain roles will behave  callero
__label__0 for example  imagine you meet someone who introduces himself as a firefighter
__label__0 language  be it spoken  signed  or written  has specific components  a lexicon and grammar
__label__1 lexicon refers to the words of a given language
__label__0 thus  lexicon is a language s vocabulary
__label__1 a phoneme  eg  the sounds  ah  vs  eh   is a basic sound unit of a given language  and different languages have different sets of phonemes
__label__1 phonemes are combined to form morphemes  which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning  eg   i  is both a phoneme and a morpheme
__label__0 we use semantics and syntax to construct language
__label__0 however  young children master language very quickly with relative ease
__label__0 b f skinner    proposed that language is learned through reinforcement
__label__0 noam chomsky    criticized this behaviorist approach  asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined
__label__0 a problem  solving strategy is a plan of action used to find a solution
__label__0 different strategies have different action plans associated with them   link
__label__0 a heuristic is another type of problem solving strategy
__label__1 while an algorithm must be followed exactly to produce a correct result  a heuristic is a general problem  solving framework  tversky  kahneman
__label__0 you can think of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems
__label__1 functional fixedness is a type of mental set where you can not perceive an object being used for something other than what it was designed for
__label__0 during the apollo  mission to the moon  nasa engineers at mission control had to overcome functional fixedness to save the lives of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft
__label__0 for example  if you think that your professor is not very nice  you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis
__label__1 hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable  even though it really was nt
__label__0 in other words  you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did
__label__1 representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking  in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something  for example  you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation  because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors
__label__0 james theorized that behavior was driven by a number of instincts  which aid survival   link
__label__1 from a biological perspective  an instinct is a species  specific pattern of behavior that is not learned
__label__0 there was  however  considerable controversy among james and his contemporaries over the exact definition of instinct
__label__0 researchers robert yerkes  pronounced  yerk  ees   and john dodson discovered that the optimal arousal level depends on the complexity and difficulty of the task to be performed   link
__label__1 this relationship is known as yerkes  dodson law  which holds that a simple task is performed best when arousal levels are relatively high and complex tasks are best performed when arousal levels are lower
__label__0 maslow s hierarchy of needswhile the theories of motivation described earlier relate to basic biological drives  individual characteristics  or social contexts  abraham maslow    proposed a hierarchy of needs that spans the spectrum of motives ranging from the biological to the individual to the social
__label__0 these needs are often depicted as a pyramid   link
__label__1 creative intelligence is marked by inventing or imagining a solution to a problem or situation
__label__0 creativity in this realm can include finding a novel solution to an unexpected problem or producing a beautiful work of art or a well  developed short story
__label__1 divergent thinking can be described as thinking  outside the box   it allows an individual to arrive at unique  multiple solutions to a given problem
__label__1 in contrast  convergent thinking describes the ability to provide a correct or well  established answer or solution to a problem  cropley    gilford
__label__0 the various hunger and satiety signals that are involved in the regulation of eating are integrated in the brain
__label__0 research suggests that several areas of the hypothalamus and hindbrain are especially important sites where this integration occurs  ahima  antwi    woods  dalessio
__label__0 obesity
__label__0 when someone weighs more than what is generally accepted as healthy for a given height  they are considered overweight or obese
__label__0 according to the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   an adult with a body mass index  bmi  between  and  is considered overweight   link
__label__1 according to the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   an adult with a body mass index  bmi  between  and  is considered overweight   link
__label__1 an adult with a bmi of  or higher is considered obese  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc
__label__0 in cases in which a person has had no success with repeated attempts to reduce weight or is at risk for death because of obesity  bariatric surgery may be recommended
__label__1 bariatric surgery is a type of surgery specifically aimed at weight reduction  and it involves modifying the gastrointestinal system to reduce the amount of food that can be eaten andor limiting how much of the digested food can be absorbed   link    mayo clinic
__label__0 a recent meta  analysis suggests that bariatric surgery is more effective than non  surgical treatment for obesity in the two  years immediately following the procedure  but to date  no long  term studies yet exist  gloy et al
__label__0 as of the  release of the diagnostic and statistical manual  fifth edition  binge eating disorder is a disorder recognized by the american psychiatric association  apa
__label__0 unlike with bulimia  eating binges are not followed by inappropriate behavior  such as purging  but they are followed by distress  including feelings of guilt and embarrassment
__label__0 physicians were considered authorities on all issues related to sex  despite the fact that they had little to no training in these issues  and it is likely that most of what people knew about sex had been learned either through their own experiences or by talking with their peers
__label__0 convinced that people would benefit from a more open dialogue on issues related to human sexuality  dr alfred kinsey of indiana university initiated large  scale survey research on the topic   link
__label__0 the results of some of these efforts were published in two books  sexual behavior in the human male and sexual behavior in the human female  which were published in  and   respectively  bullough
__label__1 based on these observations  masters and johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that are fairly similar in men and women  excitement  plateau  orgasm  and resolution   link
__label__1 the excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle  and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal
__label__0 both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time
__label__0 orgasm is marked in women by rhythmic contractions of the pelvis and uterus along with increased muscle tension
__label__0 in men  pelvic contractions are accompanied by a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles   ie  ejaculation
__label__0 in reality  these are two related  but different  issues
__label__1 gender identity refers to one s sense of being male or female
__label__0 generally  our gender identities correspond to our chromosomal and phenotypic sex  but this is not always the case
__label__0 while you re likely familiar with the term  iq  and associate it with the idea of intelligence  what does iq really mean
__label__1 iq stands for intelligence quotient and describes a score earned on a test designed to measure intelligence
__label__0 you ve already learned that there are many ways psychologists describe intelligence  or more aptly  intelligences
__label__0 interestingly  the periodic recalibrations have led to an interesting observation known as the flynn effect
__label__1 named after james flynn  who was among the first to describe this trend  the flynn effect refers to the observation that each generation has a significantly higher iq than the last
__label__0 flynn himself argues  however  that increased iq scores do not necessarily mean that younger generations are more intelligent per se  flynn  shaughnessy   fulgham
__label__0 some researchers believe that intelligence is a trait inherited from a person s parents
__label__0 scientists who research this topic typically use twin studies to determine the heritability of intelligence
__label__0 the minnesota study of twins reared apart is one of the most well  known twin studies
__label__1 children with dysgraphia have a learning disability that results in a struggle to write legibly
__label__0 the physical task of writing with a pen and paper is extremely challenging for the person
__label__0 emotions are often thought to be consciously experienced and intentional
__label__1 mood  on the other hand  refers to a prolonged  less intense  affective state that does not occur in response to something we experience
__label__0 mood states may not be consciously recognized and do not carry the intentionality that is associated with emotion  beedie  terry  lane   devonport
__label__0 other theorists  however  doubted that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of emotions is distinct enough to result in the wide variety of emotions that we experience
__label__0 thus  the cannon  bard theory of emotion was developed
__label__1 according to this view  physiological arousal and emotional experience occur simultaneously  yet independently  lang
__label__0 the relationship between our experiencing of emotions and our cognitive processing of them  and the order in which these occur  remains a topic of research and debate
__label__1 lazarus    developed the cognitive  mediational theory that asserts our emotions are determined by our appraisal of the stimulus
__label__0 this appraisal mediates between the stimulus and the emotional response  and it is immediate and often unconscious
__label__0 the amygdala is composed of various subnuclei  including the basolateral complex and the central nucleus   link
__label__1 the basolateral complex has dense connections with a variety of sensory areas of the brain
__label__0 it is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value to learning processes and memory
__label__0 culture can impact the way in which people display emotion
__label__1 a cultural display rule is one of a collection of culturally specific standards that govern the types and frequencies of displays of emotions that are acceptable  malatesta  haviland
__label__0 therefore  people from varying cultural backgrounds can have very different cultural display rules of emotion
__label__0 we also use the tone of our voices  various behaviors  and body language to communicate information about our emotional states
__label__1 body language is the expression of emotion in terms of body position or movement
__label__0 research suggests that we are quite sensitive to the emotional information communicated through body language  even if we re not consciously aware of it  de gelder    tamietto et al
__label__0 in the centuries after galen  other researchers contributed to the development of his four primary temperament types  most prominently immanuel kant  in the th century  and psychologist wilhelm wundt  in the th century   eysenck    stelmack  stalikas    wundt        link
__label__0 kant agreed with galen that everyone could be sorted into one of the four temperaments and that there was no overlap between the four categories  eysenck
__label__0 levels of consciousness
__label__0 to explain the concept of conscious versus unconscious experience  freud compared the mind to an iceberg   link
__label__0 he said that only about one  tenth of our mind is conscious  and the rest of our mind is unconscious
__label__1 our unconscious refers to that mental activity of which we are unaware and are unable to access  freud
__label__0 it strives for perfection and judges our behavior  leading to feelings of pride or  when we fall short of the ideal  feelings of guilt
__label__1 in contrast to the instinctual i d and the rule  based superego  the ego is the rational part of our personality
__label__0 it s what freud considered to be the self  and it is the part of our personality that is seen by others
__label__0 eventually you forget about it
__label__0 similarly  in the human psyche  if a memory is too overwhelming to deal with  it might be repressed and thus removed from conscious awareness  freud
__label__0 this repressed memory might cause symptoms in other areas
__label__0 for example  a four  year  old child who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle
__label__1 in projection  a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in someone else
__label__0 other defense mechanisms include rationalization  displacement  and sublimation
__label__1 in the oral stage  birth to  year   pleasure is focused on the mouth
__label__0 eating and the pleasure derived from sucking  nipples  pacifiers  and thumbs  play a large part in a baby s first year of life
__label__1 following the phallic stage of psychosexual development is a period known as the latency period   years to puberty
__label__0 this period is not considered a stage  because sexual feelings are dormant as children focus on other pursuits  such as school  friendships  hobbies  and sports
__label__0 alfred adler  a colleague of freud s and the first president of the vienna psychoanalytical society  freud s inner circle of colleagues   was the first major theorist to break away from freud   link
__label__1 he subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology  which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority
__label__0 adler      proposed the concept of the inferiority complex
__label__0 carl jung   link   was a swiss psychiatrist and protg of freud  who later split off from freud and developed his own theory  which he called analytical psychology
__label__1 the focus of analytical psychology is on working to balance opposing forces of conscious and unconscious thought  and experience within one s personality
__label__0 karen horney was one of the first women trained as a freudian psychoanalyst
__label__0 during the great depression  horney moved from germany to the united states  and subsequently moved away from freud s teachings
__label__0 if someone asks you what you ate for lunch today  more than likely you could recall this information quite easily
__label__1 this is known as automatic processing  or the encoding of details like time  space  frequency  and the meaning of words
__label__0 automatic processing is usually done without any conscious awareness
__label__1 visual encoding is the encoding of images  and acoustic encoding is the encoding of sounds  words in particular
__label__0 to see how visual encoding works  read over this list of words  car  level  dog  truth  book  value
__label__1 storage is the creation of a permanent record of information
__label__0 in order for a memory to go into storage  ie  long  term memory   it has to pass through three distinct stages  sensory memory  short  term memory  and finally long  term memory
__label__0 these stages were first proposed by richard atkinson and richard shiffrin
__label__0 one study of sensory memory researched the significance of valuable information on short  term memory storage
__label__1 j r stroop discovered a memory phenomenon in the s  you will name a color more easily if it appears printed in that color  which is called the stroop effect
__label__0 in other words  the word  red  will be named more quickly  regardless of the color the word appears in  than any word that is colored red
__label__1 long  term memory  ltm  is the continuous storage of information
__label__0 unlike short  term memory  the storage capacity of ltm has no limits
__label__1 procedural memory is a type of implicit memory  it stores information about how to do things
__label__0 it is the memory for skilled actions  such as how to brush your teeth  how to drive a car  how to swim the crawl  freestyle  stroke
__label__1 episodic memory is information about events we have personally experienced
__label__0 the concept of episodic memory was first proposed about  years ago  tulving
__label__0 how do you get that information back out of storage when you need it
__label__1 the act of getting information out of memory storage and back into conscious awareness is known as retrieval
__label__0 this would be similar to finding and opening a paper you had previously saved on your computer s hard drive
__label__0 the third form of retrieval is relearning  and it s just what it sounds like
__label__1 it involves learning information that you previously learned
__label__0 first  let s look at the role of the amygdala in memory formation
__label__0 the main job of the amygdala is to regulate emotions  such as fear and aggression   link
__label__0 there also appear to be specific neurotransmitters involved with the process of memory  such as epinephrine  dopamine  serotonin  glutamate  and acetylcholine  myhrer
__label__0 there continues to be discussion and debate among researchers as to which neurotransmitter plays which specific role  blockland
__label__0 although we do nt yet know which role each neurotransmitter plays in memory  we do know that communication among neurons via neurotransmitters is critical for developing new memories
__label__0 in other words  people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning
__label__0 b f skinner  a strict behaviorist  believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior  including the enduring  consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists
__label__1 in contrast to skinner s idea that the environment alone determines behavior  bandura    proposed the concept of reciprocal determinism  in which cognitive processes  behavior  and context all interact  each factor influencing and being influenced by the others simultaneously   link
__label__1 cognitive processes refer to all characteristics previously learned  including beliefs  expectations  and personality characteristics
__label__0 julian rotter    proposed the concept of locus of control  another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development
__label__1 distinct from self  efficacy  which involves our belief in our own abilities  locus of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives
__label__0 in rotter s view  people possess either an internal or an external locus of control   link
__label__0 anterograde amnesia is commonly caused by brain trauma  such as a blow to the head
__label__1 with anterograde amnesia  you can not remember new information  although you can remember information and events that happened prior to your injury
__label__0 the hippocampus is usually affected  mcleod
__label__0 because memory is so fragile  witnesses can be easily  and often accidentally  misled due to the problem of suggestibility
__label__1 suggestibility describes the effects of misinformation from external sources that leads to the creation of false memories
__label__0 in the fall of   a sniper in the dc area shot people at a gas station  leaving home depot  and walking down the street
__label__0 she has studied false memories as well as recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse
__label__1 loftus also developed the misinformation effect paradigm  which holds that after exposure to incorrect information  a person may misremember the original event
__label__1 let s look at the first sin of the forgetting errors  transience  which means that memories can fade over time
__label__0 here s an example of how this happens
__label__0 now let s take a look at the three errors of distortion  misattribution  suggestibility  and bias
__label__1 misattribution happens when you confuse the source of your information
__label__0 let s say alejandro was dating lucia and they saw the first hobbit movie together
__label__0 when the new year starts  do you find you accidentally write the previous year
__label__1 these are examples of proactive interference  when old information hinders the recall of newly learned information
__label__1 retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of older information
__label__0 this perspective focuses on how healthy people develop
__label__0 one pioneering humanist  abraham maslow  studied people who he considered to be healthy  creative  and productive  including albert einstein  eleanor roosevelt  thomas jefferson  abraham lincoln  and others
__label__0 maslow      found that such people share similar characteristics  such as being open  creative  loving  spontaneous  compassionate  concerned for others  and accepting of themselves
__label__0 rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves
__label__1 we experience congruence when our thoughts about our real self and ideal self are very similar  in other words  when our self  concept is accurate
__label__0 although displacement is described in terms of direction  distance is not
__label__1 distance is defined to be the magnitude or size of displacement between two positions
__label__0 note that the distance between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between them
__label__1 projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air  subject to only the acceleration of gravity
__label__0 the object is called a projectile  and its path is called its trajectory
__label__0 the object is called a projectile  and its path is called its trajectory
__label__0 the motion of falling objects  as covered in problem  solving basics for one  dimensional kinematics  is a simple one  dimensional type of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement
__label__1 dynamics is the study of the forces that cause objects and systems to move
__label__0 to understand this  we need a working definition of force
__label__0 section summary
__label__1 dynamics is the study of how forces affect the motion of objects
__label__1 external forces are any outside forces that act on a body
__label__1 a free  body diagram is a drawing of all external forces acting on a body
__label__0 what do we mean by an external force
__label__1 an intuitive notion of external is correct  an external force acts from outside the system of interest
__label__0 for example  in  link   a  the system of interest is the wagon plus the child in it
__label__0 numerous common experiences  such as stubbing a toe or throwing a ball  confirm this
__label__0 it is precisely stated in newton s third law of motion
__label__0 newton s third law of motion
__label__1 a thrust is a reaction force that pushes a body forward in response to a backward force
__label__0 rockets  airplanes  and cars are pushed forward by a thrust reaction force
__label__1 in earth s frame this looks like a westward force on the satellite  or it can be interpreted as a violation of newton s first law  the law of inertia
__label__0 an inertial frame of reference is one in which all forces are real and  equivalently  one in which newton s laws have the simple forms given in this chapter  earth s rotation is slow enough that earth is nearly an inertial frame
__label__0 you ordinarily must perform precise experiments to observe fictitious forces and the slight departures from newton s laws  such as the effect just described
__label__0 if a bulldozer pushes a car into a wall  the car will not move but it will noticeably change shape
__label__1 a change in shape due to the application of a force is a deformation
__label__0 even very small forces are known to cause some deformation
__label__0 recall that the direction of acac size a rsub  size   c      is toward the center
__label__1 you may use whichever expression is more convenient  as illustrated in examples below  a centrifuge  see  link  b  is a rotating device used to separate specimens of different densities
__label__0 high centripetal acceleration significantly decreases the time it takes for separation to occur  and makes separation possible with small samples
__label__1 let us now consider banked curves  where the slope of the road helps you negotiate the curve
__label__0 see  link
__label__1 measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of units  which are standardized values
__label__0 for example  the length of a race  which is a physical quantity  can be expressed in units of meters  for sprinters  or kilometers  for distance runners
__label__0 note that electric current will not be introduced until much later in this text
__label__1 all other physical quantities  such as force and electric charge  can be expressed as algebraic combinations of length  mass  time  and current  for example  speed is length divided by time   these units are called derived units
__label__1 the si unit for mass is the kilogram  abbreviated kg   it is defined to be the mass of a platinum  iridium cylinder kept with the old meter standard at the international bureau of weights and measures near paris
__label__0 exact replicas of the standard kilogram are also kept at the united states  national institute of standards and technology  or nist  located in gaithersburg  maryland outside of washington dc  and at other locations around the world
__label__0 next  we need to determine a conversion factor relating meters to kilometers
__label__1 a conversion factor is a ratio expressing how many of one unit are equal to another unit
__label__0 for example  models can help physicists analyze a scenario and perform a calculation  or they can be used to represent a situation in the form of a computer simulation
__label__1 a theory is an explanation for patterns in nature that is supported by scientific evidence and verified multiple times by various groups of researchers
__label__0 some theories include models to help visualize phenomena  whereas others do not
__label__0 see  link    link   and  link
__label__1 physics as it developed from the renaissance to the end of the th century is called classical physics
__label__0 it was transformed into modern physics by revolutionary discoveries made starting at the beginning of the th century
__label__1 relativity must be used whenever an object is traveling at greater than about   of the speed of light or experiences a strong gravitational field such as that near the sun
__label__1 quantum mechanics must be used for objects smaller than can be seen with a microscope
__label__1 the combination of these two theories is relativistic quantum mechanics  and it describes the behavior of small objects traveling at high speeds or experiencing a strong gravitational field
__label__1 instantaneous speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity
__label__0 for example  suppose the airplane passenger at one instant had an instantaneous velocity of  m  s  the minus meaning toward the rear of the plane
__label__0 the accelerator in a car can in fact cause it to speed up
__label__0 the greater the acceleration  the greater the change in velocity over a given time
__label__0 the formal definition of acceleration is consistent with these notions  but more inclusive
__label__1 air resistance opposes the motion of an object through the air  while friction between objects  such as between clothes and a laundry chute or between a stone and a pool into which it is dropped  also opposes motion between them
__label__1 for the ideal situations of these first few chapters  an object falling without air resistance or friction is defined to be in free  fall
__label__0 the fact that the straight  line distance   blocks  in  link  is less than the total distance walked   blocks  is one example of a general characteristic of vectors
__label__1 recall that vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction
__label__0 the degree of accuracy and precision of a measuring system are related to the uncertainty in the measurements
__label__1 uncertainty is a quantitative measure of how much your measured values deviate from a standard or expected value
__label__0 on many occasions  physicists  other scientists  and engineers need to make approximations or  guesstimates  for a particular quantity
__label__0 what is the distance to a certain destination
__label__1 an arrow used to represent a vector has a length proportional to the vector s magnitude  eg  the larger the magnitude  the longer the length of the vector  and points in the same direction as the vector  some physical quantities  like distance  either have no direction or none is specified
__label__1 a scalar is any quantity that has a magnitude  but no direction
__label__0 for example  a cc temperature  the  kilocalories   calories  of energy in a candy bar  a  km  h speed limit  a person s  m height  and a distance of  m are all scalars  quantities with no specified direction
__label__1 the head  to  tail method is a graphical way to add vectors  described in  link  below and in the steps following
__label__1 the tail of the vector is the starting point of the vector  and the head  or tip  of a vector is the final  pointed end of the arrow  head  to  tail method  the head  to  tail method of graphically adding vectors is illustrated for the two displacements of the person walking in a city considered in  link
__label__0 a  draw a vector representing the displacement to the east
__label__0 step
__label__0 to get the direction of the resultant  measure the angle it makes with the reference frame using a protractor
__label__0 note that in most calculations  we will use trigonometric relationships to determine this angle
__label__0 we will need to take a single vector and find what other vectors added together produce it
__label__0 in most cases  this involves determining the perpendicular components of a single vector  for example the x  and y  components  or the north  south and east  west components
__label__1 the study of motion is kinematics  but kinematics only describes the way objects move  their velocity and their acceleration
__label__1 dynamics considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems
__label__0 newton s laws of motion are the foundation of dynamics
__label__1 the property of a body to remain at rest or to remain in motion with constant velocity is called inertia
__label__0 newton s first law is often called the law of inertia
__label__0 a kilogram of one substance is equal in mass to a kilogram of another substance
__label__0 the quantities that might differ between them are volume and density
__label__0 section summary
__label__1 newton s first law of motion states that a body at rest remains at rest  or  if in motion  remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force
__label__0 this is also known as the law of inertia
__label__1 mass is the quantity of matter in a substance
__label__0 it is more satisfying philosophically to think of something physical actually moving between objects acting at a distance
__label__0 link  lists the exchange or carrier particles  both observed and proposed  that carry the four forces
__label__0 but the real fruit of the particle  exchange proposal is that searches for yukawa s proposed particle found it and a number of others that were completely unexpected  stimulating yet more research
__label__0 for example  friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice
__label__0 but when objects are stationary  static friction can act between them  the static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between the objects
__label__0 kinetic friction
__label__0 from the definition of work  we see that those units are force times distance
__label__0 thus  in si units  work and energy are measured in newton  meters
__label__1 a newton  meter is given the special name joule  j   and  j   n  m   kg  m  s  j   n  m   kg  m  s size
__label__1 potential energy can be stored in any elastic medium by deforming it
__label__1 indeed  the general definition of potential energy is energy due to position  shape  or configuration
__label__0 for shape or position deformations  stored energy is pes   k x  pe s   k x  size
__label__1 electrical energy is a common form that is converted to many other forms and does work in a wide range of practical situations
__label__1 fuels  such as gasoline and food  carry chemical energy that can be transferred to a system through oxidation
__label__0 chemical fuel can also produce electrical energy  such as in batteries
__label__0 atoms and molecules inside all objects are in random motion
__label__1 this internal mechanical energy from the random motions is called thermal energy  because it is related to the temperature of the object
__label__0 these and all other forms of energy can be converted into one another and can do work
__label__1 work done by a person is sometimes called useful work  which is work done on the outside world  such as lifting weights
__label__0 useful work requires a force exerted through a distance on the outside world  and so it excludes internal work  such as that done by the heart when pumping blood
__label__1 the scientific definition of linear momentum is consistent with most people s intuitive understanding of momentum  a large  fast  moving object has greater momentum than a smaller  slower object
__label__0 linear momentum is defined as the product of a system s mass multiplied by its velocity
__label__0 in symbols  linear momentum is expressed as
__label__0 it can be similarly shown that total momentum is conserved for any isolated system  with any number of objects in it
__label__0 in equation form  the conservation of momentum principle for an isolated system is written
__label__1 an elastic collision is one that also conserves internal kinetic energy
__label__1 internal kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the objects in the system
__label__0 link  illustrates an elastic collision in which internal kinetic energy and momentum are conserved
__label__0 truly elastic collisions can only be achieved with subatomic particles  such as electrons striking nuclei
__label__0 we have seen that in an elastic collision  internal kinetic energy is conserved
__label__1 an inelastic collision is one in which the internal kinetic energy changes  it is not conserved
__label__0 this lack of conservation means that the forces between colliding objects may remove or add internal kinetic energy
__label__0 the magnitude  direction  and point of application of the force are incorporated into the definition of the physical quantity called torque
__label__1 torque is the rotational equivalent of a force
__label__0 it is a measure of the effectiveness of a force in changing or accelerating a rotation  changing the angular velocity over a period of time
__label__1 a system is in neutral equilibrium if its equilibrium is independent of displacements from its original position
__label__0 a marble on a flat horizontal surface is an example
__label__0 we note that a  ra  r size   a  r      and we substitute this expression into f  ma f  ma size   f  ital
__label__0 size   f  ital
__label__0 
__label__1 recall that torque is the turning effectiveness of a force
__label__0 in this case  because ff size
__label__0 this equation is the work  energy theorem for rotational motion only
__label__1 as you may recall  net work changes the kinetic energy of a system
__label__0 the major distinction is that gases are easily compressed  whereas liquids are not
__label__0 we shall generally refer to both gases and liquids simply as fluids  and make a distinction between them only when they behave differently  phet explorations  states of matter  basics
__label__1 pressure is defined as force per unit area
__label__0 can pressure be increased in a fluid by pushing directly on the fluid
__label__0 the person making the measurement then slowly lowers the applied pressure and listens for blood flow to resume
__label__1 blood pressure pulsates because of the pumping action of the heart  reaching a maximum  called systolic pressure  and a minimum  called diastolic pressure  with each heartbeat
__label__1 systolic pressure is measured by noting the value of hh size h    when blood flow first begins as cuff pressure is lowered
__label__0 this is done by measuring the fraction of a floating object that is submerged  for example  with a hydrometer
__label__1 it is useful to define the ratio of the density of an object to a fluid  usually water  as specific gravity
__label__1 cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area
__label__1 cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area
__label__0 this general effect is called surface tension
__label__0 molecules on the surface are pulled inward by cohesive forces  reducing the surface area
__label__0 this change produces no ill effects and  in fact  may be beneficial to the tone of the circulatory system
__label__0 diastolic pressure can be an indicator of fluid balance
__label__0 when low  it may indicate that a person is hemorrhaging internally and needs a transfusion
__label__0 bladder pressure climbs steadily from zero to about  mm hg as the bladder fills to its normal capacity of  cm  cm size
__label__1 this pressure triggers the micturition reflex  which stimulates the feeling of needing to urinate
__label__0 what is more  it also causes muscles around the bladder to contract  raising the pressure to over  mm hg  accentuating the sensation
__label__0 situations in which fluid flows at a constant depth are so important that this equation is often called bernoulli s principle
__label__0 it is bernoulli s equation for fluids at constant depth
__label__0 this equation is called poiseuille s law for resistance after the french scientist j l poiseuille       who derived it in an attempt to understand the flow of blood  an often turbulent fluid
__label__0 an interesting consequence of the increase in fvfv size   f rsub  size   v      with speed is that an object falling through a fluid will not continue to accelerate indefinitely  as it would if we neglect air resistance  for example
__label__0 instead  viscous drag increases  slowing acceleration  until a critical speed  called the terminal speed  is reached and the acceleration of the object becomes zero
__label__0 once this happens  the object continues to fall at constant speed  the terminal speed
__label__1 osmosis is the transport of water through a semipermeable membrane from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration
__label__0 osmosis is driven by the imbalance in water concentration
__label__0 this is not reverse osmosis  because there is no back pressure to cause it
__label__1 what is happening is called active transport  a process in which a living membrane expends energy to move substances across it
__label__0 many living membranes move water and other substances by active transport
__label__0 only  celsius degrees span the same range as  fahrenheit degrees  thus one degree on the celsius scale is  times larger than one degree on the fahrenheit scale
__label__0 size
__label__0 the kelvin scale is the temperature scale that is commonly used in science
__label__1 it is an absolute temperature scale defined to have  k at the lowest possible temperature  called absolute zero
__label__1 furthermore  experimentation has shown that if two systems  a and b  are in thermal equilibrium with each another  and b is in thermal equilibrium with a third system c  then a is also in thermal equilibrium with c
__label__0 this conclusion may seem obvious  because all three have the same temperature  but it is basic to thermodynamics
__label__0 it is called the zeroth law of thermodynamics  the zeroth law of thermodynamics
__label__0 the ideal gas law states that
__label__0 at lower temperatures  the curves begin to look less like hyperbolas  the gas is not behaving ideally and may even contain liquid
__label__0 there is a critical point  that is  a critical temperature  above which liquid can not exist
__label__0 at sufficiently high pressure above the critical point  the gas will have the density of a liquid but will not condense
__label__1 all three curves on the phase diagram meet at a single point  the triple point  where all three phases exist in equilibrium
__label__0 for water  the triple point occurs at  k    c     c  size
__label__0 in a mixture of gases  the total pressure is the sum of partial pressures of the component gases  assuming ideal gas behavior and no chemical reactions between the components
__label__0 this law is known as dalton s law of partial pressures  after the english scientist john dalton     who proposed it
__label__1 dalton s law is based on kinetic theory  where each gas creates its pressure by molecular collisions  independent of other gases present
__label__0 the amount of water vapor in the air depends on temperature
__label__0 for example  relative humidity rises in the evening  as air temperature declines  sometimes reaching the dew point
__label__1 at the dew point temperature  relative humidity is    and fog may result from the condensation of water droplets if they are small enough to stay in suspension
__label__0 this realization helped establish the fact that heat is a form of energy
__label__0 james prescott joule      performed many experiments to establish the mechanical equivalent of heat  the work needed to produce the same effects as heat transfer
__label__0 in terms of the units used for these two terms  the best modern value for this equivalence is
__label__1 convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a fluid
__label__0 this type of transfer takes place in a forced  air furnace and in weather systems  for example
__label__0 the rate of heat transfer by emitted radiation is determined by the stefan  boltzmann law of radiation
__label__1 human metabolism is the conversion of food into heat transfer  work  and stored fat
__label__0 metabolism is an interesting example of the first law of thermodynamics in action
__label__0 the area under the curve in that case is negative  because vv size v    is negative
__label__0 pvpv size   ital
__label__1 this path dependence is seen in  link   a   where more work is done in going from a to c by the path via point b than by the path via point d the vertical paths  where volume is constant  are called isochoric processes
__label__0 since volume is constant   v    v   size    v       and no work is done in an isochoric process
__label__1 although irreversibility is seen in day  to  day life  a broken glass does not resume its original state  for instance  complete irreversibility is a statistical statement that can not be seen during the lifetime of the universe
__label__0 more precisely  an irreversible process is one that depends on path
__label__0 if the process can go in only one direction  then the reverse path differs fundamentally and the process can not be reversible
__label__0 the second law of thermodynamics  second expression
__label__1 it is impossible in any system for heat transfer from a reservoir to completely convert to work in a cyclical process in which the system returns to its initial state
__label__1 a cyclical process brings a system  such as the gas in a cylinder  back to its original state at the end of every cycle
__label__0 most heat engines  such as reciprocating piston engines and rotating turbines  use cyclical processes
__label__0 the second law of thermodynamics can be restated in terms of the carnot cycle  and so what carnot actually discovered was this fundamental law
__label__1 any heat engine employing the carnot cycle is called a carnot engine
__label__0 what is crucial to the carnot cycle  and  in fact  defines it  is that only reversible processes are used
__label__1 irreversible processes involve dissipative factors  such as friction and turbulence
__label__1 with respect to entropy  there are only two possibilities  entropy is constant for a reversible process  and it increases for an irreversible process
__label__0 there is a fourth version of the second law of thermodynamics stated in terms of entropy
__label__0 let us now imagine applying this approach to perhaps a small sample of gas
__label__0 because counting microstates and macrostates involves statistics  this is called statistical analysis
__label__0 the macrostates of a gas correspond to its macroscopic properties  such as volume  temperature  and pressure  and its microstates correspond to the detailed description of the positions and velocities of its atoms
__label__0 consider  for example  plucking a plastic ruler to the left as shown in  link
__label__0 the deformation of the ruler creates a force in the opposite direction  known as a restoring force
__label__1 once released  the restoring force causes the ruler to move back toward its stable equilibrium position  where the net force on it is zero
__label__1 for small displacements  a pendulum is a simple harmonic oscillator
__label__1 a simple pendulum is defined to have an object that has a small mass  also known as the pendulum bob  which is suspended from a light wire or string  such as shown in  link
__label__0 exploring the simple pendulum a bit further  we can discover the conditions under which it performs simple harmonic motion  and we can derive an interesting expression for its period
__label__0 such a system is underdamped  its displacement is represented by the curve in  link
__label__0 curve b in  link  represents an overdamped system
__label__0 as with critical damping  it too may overshoot the equilibrium position  but will reach equilibrium over a longer period of time
__label__1 the phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called resonance
__label__0 a system being driven at its natural frequency is said to resonate
__label__0 as the driving frequency gets progressively higher than the resonant or natural frequency  the amplitude of the oscillations becomes smaller  until the oscillations nearly disappear and your finger simply moves up and down with little effect on the ball
__label__0 the wave in  link  propagates in the horizontal direction while the surface is disturbed in the vertical direction
__label__1 such a wave is called a transverse wave or shear wave  in such a wave  the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of propagation
__label__1 in contrast  in a longitudinal wave or compressional wave  the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation
__label__0 the crests of the two waves are precisely aligned  as are the troughs
__label__0 this superposition produces pure constructive interference
__label__1 because the disturbances add  pure constructive interference produces a wave that has twice the amplitude of the individual waves  but has the same wavelength
__label__0 link  and  link  show three standing waves that can be created on a string that is fixed at both ends
__label__1 nodes are the points where the string does not move  more generally  nodes are where the wave disturbance is zero in a standing wave
__label__0 the fixed ends of strings must be nodes  too  because the string can not move there
__label__0 the wave resulting from the superposition of two similar  frequency waves has a frequency that is the average of the two
__label__0 this wave fluctuates in amplitude  or beats  with a frequency called the beat frequency
__label__0 we can determine the beat frequency by adding two waves together mathematically
__label__0 you can also directly sense the frequency of a sound
__label__1 perception of frequency is called pitch
__label__0 the wavelength of sound is not directly sensed  but indirect evidence is found in the correlation of the size of musical instruments with their pitch
__label__0 the lack of contrast makes image interpretation very difficult
__label__1 contrast is the difference in intensity between objects and the background on which they are observed
__label__0 stains  such as dyes  fluorophores  etc
__label__1 a polarization microscope also enhances contrast by utilizing a wave characteristic of light
__label__0 polarization microscopes are useful for objects that are optically active or birefringent  particularly if those characteristics vary from place to place in the object
__label__0 the standing wave formed in the tube has its maximum air displacement  an antinode  at the open end  where motion is unconstrained  and no displacement  a node  at the closed end  where air movement is halted

__label__1 hearing is the perception of sound
__label__1 perception is commonly defined to be awareness through the senses  a typically circular definition of higher  level processes in living organisms
__label__1 pitch perception is directly related to frequency and is not greatly affected by other physical quantities such as intensity
__label__1 musical notes are particular sounds that can be produced by most instruments and in western music have particular names
__label__1 combinations of notes constitute music
__label__0 this is true for other perceptions of sound  such as music and noise
__label__0 we shall not delve further into them  rather  we will concentrate on the question of loudness perception
__label__0 a unit called a phon is used to express loudness numerically
__label__1 phons differ from decibels because the phon is a unit of loudness perception  whereas the decibel is a unit of physical intensity
__label__0 atomic and molecular interactions  such as the forces of friction  cohesion  and adhesion  are now known to be manifestations of the electromagnetic force
__label__0 static electricity is just one aspect of the electromagnetic force  which also includes moving electricity and magnetism
__label__0 today we have the advantage of knowing that normal matter is made of atoms  and that atoms contain positive and negative charges  usually in equal amounts
__label__0 link  shows a simple model of an atom with negative electrons orbiting its positive nucleus
__label__1 the nucleus is positive due to the presence of positively charged protons
__label__0 nearly all charge in nature is due to electrons and protons  which are two of the three building blocks of most matter
__label__0 these free electrons can move through the material much as air moves through loose sand
__label__1 any substance that has free electrons and allows charge to move relatively freely through it is called a conductor
__label__0 the moving electrons may collide with fixed atoms and molecules  losing some energy  but they can move in a conductor
__label__0 it is not necessary to transfer excess charge directly to an object in order to charge it
__label__1 link  shows a method of induction wherein a charge is created in a nearby object  without direct contact
__label__0 at this time  the idea of liberty became an important concept
__label__0 according to john locke  an english political philosopher of the seventeenth century  all people have natural rights to life  liberty  and property
__label__0 from this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed
__label__0 in socialist countries  the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity  transportation systems like airlines and railroads  and telecommunications systems
__label__1 in many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy  only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government
__label__0 for example  in china  the government is run by members of the chinese communist party
__label__0 thus  us citizens vote for members of congress  the president and vice president  members of state legislatures  governors  mayors  and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf
__label__1 most representative governments favor majority rule  the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority
__label__0 if the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it  the law will be enacted
__label__0 at the other end of the political spectrum are elite  driven forms of government
__label__1 in a monarchy  one ruler  usually a hereditary ruler  holds political power
__label__0 although the power of some monarchs is limited by law  and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country  this is not always the case
__label__0 this belief is called the elite theory of government
__label__1 in contrast to that perspective is the pluralist theory of government  which says that political power rests with competing interest groups who share influence in government
__label__0 pluralist theorists assume that citizens who want to get involved in the system do so because of the great number of access points to government
__label__0 rather than resting in the hands of individuals  a variety of organized groups hold power  with some groups having more influence on certain issues than others
__label__0 thousands of interest groups exist in the united states
__label__0 the non  governmental order  will ngos democratise  or merely disrupt  global governance   the economist   december
__label__0 approximately  percent of americans report belonging to at least one group
__label__0 ronald j hrebenar
__label__0 many of the tradeoffs made by government are about freedom of speech
__label__1 the first amendment of the constitution gives americans the right to express their opinions on matters of concern to them  the federal government can not interfere with this right
__label__0 because of the fourteenth amendment  state governments must protect this right also
__label__0 are fewer people today active in politics than in the past
__label__0 political scientist robert putnam has argued that civic engagement is declining  although many americans may report belonging to groups  these groups are usually large  impersonal ones with thousands of members
__label__0 people who join groups such as amnesty international or greenpeace may share certain values and ideals with other members of the group  but they do not actually interact with these other members
__label__0 they argued that it was unfair to deny eighteen  year  olds the right to vote for the people who had the power to send them to war
__label__1 as a result  the twenty  sixth amendment  which lowered the voting age in national elections to eighteen  was ratified by the states and went into effect in
__label__0 some people prefer even more active and direct forms of engagement such as protest marches and demonstrations  including civil disobedience
__label__0 such tactics were used successfully in the african american civil rights movement of the s and s and remain effective today
__label__0 the beliefs and attitudes that led to the call for independence had long been an important part of colonial life
__label__0 of all the political thinkers who influenced american beliefs about government  the most important is surely john locke   link
__label__0 the most significant contributions of locke  a seventeenth  century english philosopher  were his ideas regarding the relationship between government and natural rights  which were believed to be god  given rights to life  liberty  and property
__label__0 so committed were the british to the protection of these natural rights that when the royal stuart dynasty began to intrude upon them in the seventeenth century  parliament removed king james ii  already disliked because he was roman catholic  in the glorious revolution and invited his protestant daughter and her husband to rule the nation
__label__0 before offering the throne to william and mary  however  parliament passed the english bill of rights in
__label__1 a bill of rights is a list of the liberties and protections possessed by a nation s citizens
__label__0 
__label__1 the first such tax to draw the ire of colonists was the stamp act  passed in   which required that almost all paper goods  such as diplomas  land deeds  contracts  and newspapers  have revenue stamps placed on them
__label__0 the outcry was so great that the new tax was quickly withdrawn  but its repeal was soon followed by a series of other tax acts  such as the townshend acts     which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass  tea  and paint
__label__0 growth of the american revolution
__label__0 new york  free press
__label__0 this act of defiance became known as the boston tea party
__label__0 today  many who do not agree with the positions of the democratic or the republican party have organized themselves into an oppositional group dubbed the tea party   link
__label__0 these acts virtually abolished town meetings in massachusetts and otherwise interfered with the colony s ability to govern itself
__label__0 this assault on massachusetts and its economy enraged people throughout the colonies  and delegates from all the colonies except georgia formed the first continental congress to create a unified opposition to great britain
__label__0 among other things  members of the institution developed a declaration of rights and grievances
__label__0 congress drafted a declaration of causes explaining the colonies  reasons for rebellion
__label__1 on july     congress declared american independence from britain and two days later signed the declaration of independence
__label__0 thus  powers given to the central government were severely limited
__label__1 the confederation congress  formerly the continental congress  had the authority to exchange ambassadors and make treaties with foreign governments and indian tribes  declare war  coin currency and borrow money  and settle disputes between states
__label__0 each state legislature appointed delegates to the congress  these men could be recalled at any time
__label__1 the weaknesses of the articles of confederation  already recognized by many  became apparent to all as a result of an uprising of massachusetts farmers  led by daniel shays
__label__0 known as shays  rebellion  the incident panicked the governor of massachusetts  who called upon the national government for assistance
__label__0 however  with no power to raise an army  the government had no troops at its disposal
__label__0 all the states except rhode island chose delegates to send to the meeting  a total of seventy men in all  but many did not attend
__label__0 among those not in attendance were john adams and thomas jefferson  both of whom were overseas representing the country as diplomats
__label__0 because the shortcomings of the articles of confederation proved impossible to overcome  the convention that met in philadelphia in  decided to create an entirely new government
__label__0 one of the first differences among the delegates to become clear was between those from large states  such as new york and virginia  and those who represented small states  like delaware
__label__1 when discussing the structure of the government under the new constitution  the delegates from virginia called for a bicameral legislature consisting of two houses
__label__0 the number of a state s representatives in each house was to be based on the state s population
__label__0 after debating at length over whether the virginia plan or the new jersey plan provided the best model for the nation s legislature  the framers of the constitution had ultimately arrived at what is called the great compromise  suggested by roger sherman of connecticut
__label__1 congress  it was decided  would consist of two chambers  the senate and the house of representatives
__label__0 the framers resolved this problem through a separation of powers  dividing the national government into three separate branches and assigning different responsibilities to each one  as shown in  link
__label__0 they also created a system of checks and balances by giving each of three branches of government the power to restrict the actions of the others  thus requiring them to work together
__label__1 in a federal system  power is divided between the federal  or national  government and the state governments
__label__1 great or explicit powers  called enumerated powers  were granted to the federal government to declare war  impose taxes  coin and regulate currency  regulate foreign and interstate commerce  raise and maintain an army and a navy  maintain a post office  make treaties with foreign nations and with native american tribes  and make laws regulating the naturalization of immigrants
__label__0 on september     the delegates to the constitutional convention in philadelphia voted to approve the document they had drafted over the course of many months
__label__0 some did not support it  but the majority did
__label__0 other delegates  such as edmund randolph of virginia  disapproved of the constitution because it created a new federal judicial system
__label__0 their fear was that the federal courts would be too far away from where those who were tried lived
__label__1 opponents of ratification were called anti  federalists
__label__0 anti  federalists feared the power of the national government and believed state legislatures  with which they had more contact  could better protect their freedoms
__label__0 the approval of new york was the last major hurdle
__label__1 facing considerable opposition to the constitution in that state  alexander hamilton  james madison  and john jay wrote a series of essays  beginning in   arguing for a strong federal government and support of the constitution   link
__label__0 later compiled as the federalist and now known as the federalist papers  these eighty  five essays were originally published in newspapers in new york and other states under the name of publius  a supporter of the roman republic
__label__0 indeed  hamilton asked rhetorically  would american citizens best be served by a representative  whose observation does not travel beyond the circle of his neighbors and his acquaintances  or by someone with more extensive knowledge of the world
__label__0 to those who argued that a merchant and land  owning elite would come to dominate congress  hamilton countered that the majority of men currently sitting in new york s state senate and assembly were landowners of moderate wealth and that artisans usually chose merchants   their natural patron  s  and friend  s    to represent them
__label__0 an aristocracy would not arise  and if it did  its members would have been chosen by lesser men
__label__0 for those who worried that the president might indeed grow too ambitious or king  like  hamilton  in federalist no   provided assurance that placing the leadership of the country in the hands of one person was not dangerous
__label__0 the bill of rights was intended to quiet the fears of anti  federalists that the constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government
__label__0 many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the english bill of rights and the virginia declaration of rights
__label__1 for example  the right to bear arms for protection  second amendment   the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime  third amendment   the right to a trial by jury  sixth and seventh amendments   and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment  eighth amendment  are taken from the english bill of rights
__label__1 the fifth amendment  which requires among other things that people can not be deprived of their life  liberty  or property except by a legal proceeding  was also greatly influenced by english law as well as the protections granted to virginians in the virginia declaration of rights
__label__0 the ninth and tenth amendments were intended to provide yet another assurance that people s rights would be protected and that the federal government would not become too powerful
__label__1 the ninth amendment guarantees that liberties extend beyond those described in the preceding documents
__label__0 this was an important acknowledgment that the protected rights were extensive  and the government should not attempt to interfere with them
__label__1 for example  the seventeenth amendment  ratified in   gave voters the right to directly elect us senators
__label__1 the twentieth amendment  which was ratified in  during the great depression  moved the date of the presidential inauguration from march to january
__label__0 in a time of crisis  like a severe economic depression  the president needed to take office almost immediately after being elected  and modern transportation allowed the new president to travel to the nation s capital quicker than before
__label__1 the thirteenth amendment abolished slavery in the united states
__label__1 the fourteenth amendment granted citizenship to african americans and equal protection under the law regardless of race or color
__label__0 it also prohibited states from depriving their residents of life  liberty  or property without a legal proceeding
__label__0 subsequent amendments further extended the suffrage
__label__1 the twenty  third amendment    allowed residents of washington  dc to vote for the president
__label__1 the twenty  fourth amendment    abolished the use of poll taxes
__label__0 specifically  the federal design spelled out in the constitution divides powers between two levels of government  the states and the federal government  and creates a mechanism for them to check and balance one another
__label__1 as an institutional design  federalism both safeguards state interests and creates a strong union led by a capable central government
__label__0 the main advantage of this supermajority requirement is that no changes to the constitution can occur unless there is broad support within congress and among states
__label__0 the potential drawback is that numerous national amendment initiatives  such as the equal rights amendment  era   which aims to guarantee equal rights regardless of sex  have failed because they can not garner sufficient consent among members of congress or  in the case of the era  the states
__label__0 before the late s  the united kingdom s unitary system was centralized to the extent that the national government held the most important levers of power
__label__0 since then  power has been gradually decentralized through a process of devolution  leading to the creation of regional governments in scotland  wales  and northern ireland as well as the delegation of specific responsibilities to them
__label__0 other democratic countries with unitary systems  such as france  japan  and sweden  have followed a similar path of decentralization
__label__1 the last clause of article i  section   commonly referred to as the elastic clause or the necessary and proper cause  enables congress  to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying  out its constitutional responsibilities
__label__0 while the enumerated powers define the policy areas in which the national government has authority  the elastic clause allows it to create the legal means to fulfill those responsibilities
__label__0 haw
__label__0 to address this concern  congress passed and president clinton signed the defense of marriage act  doma  in
__label__1 the law declared that  no state  or other political subdivision within the united states  need recognize a marriage between persons of the same sex  even if the marriage was concluded or recognized in another state
__label__0 the law also barred federal benefits for same  sex partners
__label__1 the privileges and immunities clause of article iv asserts that states are prohibited from discriminating against out  of  staters by denying them such guarantees as access to courts  legal protection  property rights  and travel rights
__label__0 the clause has not been interpreted to mean there can not be any difference in the way a state treats residents and non  residents
__label__0 as george washington s secretary of the treasury from  to   alexander hamilton championed legislative efforts to create a publicly chartered bank
__label__1 for hamilton  the establishment of the bank of the united states was fully within congress s authority  and he hoped the bank would foster economic development  print and circulate paper money  and provide loans to the government
__label__0 although thomas jefferson  washington s secretary of state  staunchly opposed hamilton s plan on the constitutional grounds that the national government had no authority to create such an instrument  hamilton managed to convince the reluctant president to sign the legislation
__label__0 the lehrman institute
__label__0 when the bank s charter expired in   jeffersonian democratic  republicans prevailed in blocking its renewal
__label__0 however  the fiscal hardships that plagued the government during the war of   coupled with the fragility of the country s financial system  convinced congress and then  president james madison to create the second bank of the united states in
__label__0 many states rejected the second bank  arguing that the national government was infringing upon the states  constitutional jurisdiction
__label__0 defining the scope of national power was the subject of another landmark supreme court decision in
__label__1 in gibbons v ogden  the court had to interpret the commerce clause of article i  section   specifically  it had to determine whether the federal government had the sole authority to regulate the licensing of steamboats operating between new york and new jersey  gibbons v ogden   us
__label__0 aaron ogden  who had obtained an exclusive license from new york state to operate steamboat ferries between new york city and new jersey  sued thomas gibbons  who was operating ferries along the same route under a coasting license issued by the federal government
__label__0 gibbons lost in new york state courts and appealed
__label__0 various states railed against the nationalization of power that had been going on since the late s
__label__1 when president john adams signed the sedition act in   which made it a crime to speak openly against the government  the kentucky and virginia legislatures passed resolutions declaring the act null on the grounds that they retained the discretion to follow national laws
__label__0 in effect  these resolutions articulated the legal reasoning underpinning the doctrine of nullification  that states had the right to reject national laws they deemed unconstitutional
__label__0 w
__label__0 led by john calhoun  president jackson s vice president  nullifiers argued that high tariffs on imported goods benefited northern manufacturing interests while disadvantaging economies in the south
__label__1 south carolina passed an ordinance of nullification declaring both tariff acts null and void and threatened to leave the union
__label__0 the federal government responded by enacting the force bill in   authorizing president jackson to use military force against states that challenged federal tariff laws
__label__0 the ultimate showdown between national and state authority came during the civil war
__label__0 prior to the conflict  in dred scott v sandford  the supreme court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories
__label__0 dred scott v sandford   us
__label__0 but the election of president abraham lincoln in  led eleven southern states to secede from the united states because they believed the new president would challenge the institution of slavery
__label__0 first  the union victory put an end to the right of states to secede and to challenge legitimate national laws
__label__0 second  congress imposed several conditions for readmitting former confederate states into the union  among them was ratification of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments
__label__0 in sum  after the civil war the power balance shifted toward the national government  a movement that had begun several decades before with mcculloch v maryland    and gibbons v odgen
__label__0 the american political economy  institutional evolution of market and state
__label__0 new york  routledge
__label__1 to curtail widespread anticompetitive practices in the railroad industry  congress passed the interstate commerce act in   which created the interstate commerce commission
__label__1 three years later  national regulatory capacity was broadened by the sherman antitrust act of   which made it illegal to monopolize or attempt to monopolize and conspire in restraining commerce  figure commerce
__label__0 cooperative federalism was born of necessity and lasted well into the twentieth century as the national and state governments each found it beneficial
__label__1 under this model  both levels of government coordinated their actions to solve national problems  such as the great depression and the civil rights struggle of the following decades
__label__0 the court s obstructionist position infuriated roosevelt  leading him in  to propose a court  packing plan that would add one new justice for each one over the age of seventy  thus allowing the president to make a maximum of six new appointments
__label__0 before congress took action on the proposal  the supreme court began leaning in support of the new deal as chief justice charles evans hughes and justice owen roberts changed their view on federalism

__label__0 in the s  president lyndon johnson s administration expanded the national government s role in society even more
__label__1 medicaid  which provides medical assistance to the indigent   medicare  which provides health insurance to the elderly and disabled   and school nutrition programs were created
__label__0 the elementary and secondary education act     the higher education act     and the head start preschool program    were established to expand educational opportunities and equality   link
__label__0 the clean air act     the highway safety act     and the fair packaging and labeling act    promoted environmental and consumer protection
__label__0 finally  laws were passed to promote urban renewal  public housing development  and affordable housing
__label__0 
__label__0 the creation of the department of homeland security federalized disaster response power in washington  and the transportation security administration was created to federalize airport security
__label__0 broad new federal policies and mandates have also been carried out in the form of the faith  based initiative and no child left behind  during the george w bush administration  and the affordable care act  during barack obama s administration
__label__0 federal cash grants do come with strings attached  the national government has an interest in seeing that public monies are used for policy activities that advance national objectives
__label__1 categorical grants are federal transfers formulated to limit recipients  discretion in the use of funds and subject them to strict administrative criteria that guide project selection  performance  and financial oversight  among other things
__label__0 these grants also often require some commitment of matching funds
__label__0 the upward slope since the s is primarily due to the increase in federal grant money going to medicaid
__label__0 federally funded health  care programs jumped from   billion in  to   billion in
__label__0 dilger   federal grants to state and local governments
__label__0 health  related grant programs such as medicaid and the children s health insurance program  chip  represented more than half of total federal grant expenses
__label__0 by eliminating uncapped federal funding  as the tanf issue illustrates  the national government can reverse the escalating costs of federal grant programs
__label__0 this point has not been lost on speaker of the house paul ryan  r  wi   former chair of the house budget committee and the house ways and means committee  who has tried multiple times but without success to convert medicaid into a block grant  a reform he estimates could save the federal government upwards of   billion over ten years
__label__0 jonathan weisman   ryan s budget would cut   trillion in spending over a decade   new york times   april
__label__0 another noteworthy characteristic of block grants is that their flexibility has been undermined over time as a result of creeping categorization  a process in which the national government places new administrative requirements on state and local governments or supplants block grants with new categorical grants

__label__0 marital rights for gays and lesbians have also significantly changed in recent years
__label__0 by passing the defense of marriage act  doma  in   the federal government stepped into this policy issue
__label__1 not only did doma allow states to choose whether to recognize same  sex marriages  it also defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman  which meant that same  sex couples were denied various federal provisions and benefits  such as the right to file joint tax returns and receive social security survivor benefits
__label__0 edith windsor  the plaintiff in the landmark supreme court case united states v windsor  has become an icon of the marriage equality movement for her successful effort to force repeal the doma provision that denied married same  sex couples a host of federal provisions and protections
__label__0 in   after having lived together since the late s  windsor and her partner thea spyer were married in canada  where same  sex marriage was legal
__label__0 after spyer died in   windsor received a   federal tax bill on the estate spyer had left her
__label__0 in   marriage equality was recognized in thirty  six states plus washington  dc  up from seventeen in
__label__0 the diffusion of marriage equality across states was driven in large part by federal district and appeals courts  which have used the rationale underpinning the windsor case  ie  laws can not discriminate between same  sex and opposite  sex couples based on the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment  to invalidate state bans on same  sex marriage
__label__0 the  court decision not to hear a collection of cases from four different states essentially affirmed same  sex marriage in thirty states
__label__0 so madd decided to redirect its lobbying efforts at congress  hoping to find sympathetic representatives willing to take action
__label__1 in   the federal government passed the national minimum drinking age act  nmdaa   a crosscutting mandate that gradually reduced federal highway grant money to any state that failed to increase the legal age for alcohol purchase and possession to twenty  one
__label__0 after losing a legal battle against the nmdaa  all states were in compliance by
__label__0 south dakota v dole   us
__label__0 among the merits of federalism are that it promotes policy innovation and political participation and accommodates diversity of opinion
__label__0 on the subject of policy innovation  supreme court justice louis brandeis observed in  that  a single courageous state may  if its citizens choose  serve as a laboratory  and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country
__label__0 new state ice co v liebmann   us
__label__0 what brandeis meant was that states could harness their constitutional authority to engage in policy innovations that might eventually be diffused to other states and at the national level

__label__0 
__label__0 to be more precise in their language  political scientists and legal experts make a distinction between civil liberties and civil rights  even though the constitution has been interpreted to protect both
__label__1 we typically envision civil liberties as being limitations on government power  intended to protect freedoms that governments may not legally intrude on
__label__0 for example  the first amendment denies the government the power to prohibit  the free exercise  of religion  the states and the national government can not forbid people to follow a religion of their choice  even if politicians and judges think the religion is misguided  blasphemous  or otherwise inappropriate
__label__0 actors and civil rights activists sidney poitier  left   harry belafonte  center   and charlton heston  right  on the steps of the lincoln memorial on august     during the march on washington
__label__1 a bill of attainder is a law that convicts or punishes someone for a crime without a trial  a tactic used fairly frequently in england against the king s enemies
__label__0 prohibition of such laws means that the us congress can not simply punish people who are unpopular or seem to be guilty of crimes
__label__0 particularly in times of war  or even in response to threats against national security  the government has held suspected enemy agents without access to civilian courts  often without access to lawyers or a defense  seeking instead to try them before military tribunals or detain them indefinitely without trial
__label__0 for example  during the civil war  president abraham lincoln detained suspected confederate saboteurs and sympathizers in union  controlled states and attempted to have them tried in military courts  leading the supreme court to rule in ex parte milligan that the government could not bypass the civilian court system in states where it was operating
__label__0 ex parte milligan   us
__label__0 argued that the constitution was  merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation   rather than to concern itself with  the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns
__label__0 hamilton went on to argue that listing some rights might actually be dangerous  because it would provide a pretext for people to claim that rights not included in such a list were not protected
__label__0 later  james madison  in his speech introducing the proposed amendments that would become the bill of rights  acknowledged another federalist argument   it has been said  that a bill of rights is not necessary  because the establishment of this government has not repealed those declarations of rights which are added to the several state constitutions
__label__0 american history from revolution to reconstruction and beyond   madison speech proposing the bill of rights june     httpwwwletrugnl  usa  documents    madison  speech  proposing  the  bill  of  rights  june  php  march
__label__0 for that matter  the articles of confederation had not included a specific listing of rights either
__label__0 ultimately  james madison delivered on this promise by proposing a package of amendments in the first congress  drawing from the declaration of rights in the virginia state constitution  suggestions from the ratification conventions  and other sources  which were extensively debated in both houses of congress and ultimately proposed as twelve separate amendments for ratification by the states
__label__1 ten of the amendments were successfully ratified by the requisite  percent of the states and became known as the bill of rights   link
__label__0 in the wake of the civil war  however  the prevailing thinking about the application of the bill of rights to the states changed
__label__1 soon after slavery was abolished by the thirteenth amendment  state governments  particularly those in the former confederacy  began to pass  black codes  that restricted the rights of former slaves and effectively relegated them to second  class citizenship under their state laws and constitutions
__label__0 angered by these actions  members of the radical republican faction in congress demanded that the laws be overturned
__label__0 legal scholars and the courts have extensively debated the meaning of this privileges or immunities clause over the years  some have argued that it was supposed to extend the entire bill of rights  or at least the first eight amendments  to the states  while others have argued that only some rights are extended
__label__0 in   justice john paul stevens  writing for a majority of the supreme court  argued in saenz v roe that the clause protects the right to travel from one state to another
__label__0 saenz v roe   us
__label__0 more recently  justice clarence thomas argued in the  mcdonald v chicago ruling that the individual right to bear arms applied to the states because of this clause
__label__0 mcdonald v chicago   us
__label__0 the second provision of the fourteenth amendment that pertains to applying the bill of rights to the states is the due process clause  which says   nor shall any state deprive any person of life  liberty  or property  without due process of law
__label__1 this provision is similar to the fifth amendment in that it also refers to  due process   a term that generally means people must be treated fairly and impartially by government officials  or with what is commonly referred to as substantive due process
__label__0 although the text of the provision does not mention rights specifically  the courts have held in a series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that can not be denied by the states
__label__0 we can broadly divide the provisions of the bill of rights into three categories
__label__0 the first  second  third  and fourth amendments protect basic individual freedoms  the fourth  partly   fifth  sixth  seventh  and eighth protect people suspected or accused of criminal activity  and the ninth and tenth  are consistent with the framers  view that the bill of rights is not necessarily an exhaustive list of all the rights people have and guarantees a role for state as well as federal government   link
__label__0 at the same time  public schooling was beginning to take root on a wide scale
__label__0 since most states had traditional protestant majorities and most state officials were protestants themselves  the public school curriculum incorporated many protestant features  at times  these features would come into conflict with the beliefs of children from other christian sects or from other religious traditions
__label__0 the establishment clause today tends to be interpreted a bit more broadly than in the past  it not only forbids the creation of a  church of the united states  or  church of ohio  it also forbids the government from favoring one set of religious beliefs over others or favoring religion  of any variety  over non  religion
__label__0 thus  the government can not promote  say  islamic beliefs over sikh beliefs or belief in god over atheism or agnosticism   link
__label__1 the free exercise clause  on the other hand  limits the ability of the government to control or restrict religious practices
__label__0 this portion of the first amendment regulates not the government s promotion of religion  but rather government suppression of religious beliefs and practices
__label__0 in the s and s  the court decided two cases in which it laid out a general test for deciding similar cases in the future
__label__0 in both sherbert v verner  a case dealing with unemployment compensation  and wisconsin v yoder  which dealt with the right of amish parents to homeschool their children  the court said that for a law to be allowed to limit or burden a religious practice  the government must meet two criteria
__label__0 sherbert v verner   us      wisconsin v yoder   us
__label__1 it must demonstrate both that it had a  compelling governmental interest  in limiting that practice and that the restriction was  narrowly tailored
__label__1 in other words  it must show there was a very good reason for the law in question and that the law was the only feasible way of achieving that goal
__label__0 this standard became known as the sherbert test
__label__0 but because it replaced the sherbert test with one that allowed more government regulation of religious practices  followers of other religious traditions grew concerned that state and local laws  even ones neutral on their face  might be used to curtail their religious practices
__label__0 in   in response to this decision  congress passed a law known as the religious freedom restoration act  rfra   which was followed in  by the religious land use and institutionalized persons act after part of the rfra was struck down by the supreme court
__label__0 in addition  since   twenty  one states have passed state rfras that include the sherbert test in state law  and state court decisions in eleven states have enshrined the sherbert test s compelling governmental interest interpretation of the free exercise clause into state law
__label__0 juliet eilperin    states have heightened religious freedom protections   washington post   march   httpwwwwashingtonpostcomblogsthefixwpwhereintheusarethereheightenedprotectionsforreligiousfreedom
__label__0 proponents of state rfra laws argued that people and businesses ought not be compelled to endorse practices their religious beliefs held to be immoral or indecent and feared clergy might be compelled to officiate same  sex marriages against their religion s teachings
__label__0 opponents of rfra laws argued that individuals and businesses should be required  per obergefell v hodges  to serve same  sex marriages on an equal basis as a matter of ensuring the civil rights of gays and lesbians  just as they would be obliged to cater or photograph an interracial marriage
__label__0 obergefell v hodges   us
__label__0 in the s  however  the supreme court s rulings on free expression became more liberal  in response to the vietnam war and the growing antiwar movement
__label__1 in a  case involving the ku klux klan  brandenburg v ohio  the supreme court found that only speech or writing that constituted a direct call or plan to imminent lawless action  an illegal act in the immediate future  could be suppressed  the mere advocacy of a hypothetical revolution was not enough
__label__0 brandenburg v ohio   us
__label__0 the supreme court also found that various forms of symbolic speech  wearing clothing like an armband that carried a political symbol or raising a fist in the air  for example  were subject to the same protections as written and spoken communication
__label__0 this court decision was strongly criticized  and congress responded by passing a federal law  the flag protection act  intended to overrule it  the act  too  was struck down as unconstitutional in
__label__0 united states v eichman   us
__label__0 since then  congress has attempted on several occasions to propose constitutional amendments allowing the states and federal government to re  criminalize flag desecration  to no avail
__label__0 more specifically  the papers were compiled at the request of secretary of defense robert mcnamara and provided a study of us political and military involvement in vietnam from  to
__label__0 daniel ellsberg famously released passages of the papers to the press to show that the united states had secretly enlarged the scope of the war by bombing cambodia and laos among other deeds while lying to the american public about doing so
__label__1 another key exception to the right to freedom of expression is obscenity  acts or statements that are extremely offensive under current societal standards
__label__0 defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts  supreme court justice potter stewart famously said of obscenity  having watched pornography in the supreme court building   i know it when i see it
__label__0 the pion must then be captured and  thus  can not be directly observed because that would amount to a permanent violation of mass  energy conservation
__label__1 such particles  like the pion above  are called virtual particles  because they can not be directly observed but their effects can be directly observed
__label__0 realizing all this  yukawa used the information on the range of the strong nuclear force to estimate the mass of the pion  the particle that carries it
__label__0 he shared the  nobel prize with julian schwinger and s i tomonaga for work in qed with its deep implications for particle physics
__label__0 why is it that particles called gluons are listed as the carrier particles for the strong nuclear force when  in the yukawa particle and the heisenberg uncertainty principle revisited  we saw that pions apparently carry that force
__label__0 the answer is that pions are exchanged but they have a substructure and  as we explore it  we find that the strong force is actually related to the indirectly observed but more fundamental gluons
__label__0 in fact  all the carrier particles are thought to be fundamental in the sense that they have no substructure
__label__0 quarks have been mentioned at various points in this text as fundamental building blocks and members of the exclusive club of truly elementary particles
__label__1 note that an elementary or fundamental particle has no substructure  it is not made of other particles  and has no finite size other than its wavelength
__label__0 this does not mean that fundamental particles are stable  some decay  while others do not
__label__0 originally  three quark types  or flavors  were proposed to account for the then  known mesons and baryons
__label__0 these quark flavors are named up  u   down  d   and strange  s
__label__0 all quarks have half  integral spin and are thus fermions
__label__0 the analogy to the unification of electric and magnetic forces is quite good  the four forces are distinct under normal circumstances  but there are hints of connections even on the atomic scale  and there may be conditions under which the forces are intimately related and even indistinguishable
__label__0 the search for a correct theory linking the forces  called the grand unified theory  gut   is explored in this section in the realm of particle physics
__label__0 frontiers of physics expands the story in making a connection with cosmology  on the opposite end of the distance scale
__label__0 link  is a feynman diagram showing how the weak nuclear force is transmitted by the carrier particle z  z  size   z rsup  size          similar to the diagrams in  link  and  link  for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces
__label__0 it is beyond the scope of this text to go into more detail on the types of quark and gluon interactions that underlie the observable particles  but the theory  quantum chromodynamics or qcd  is very self  consistent
__label__0 so successful have qcd and the electroweak theory been that  taken together  they are called the standard model
__label__0 advances in knowledge are expected to modify  but not overthrow  the standard model of particle physics and forces
__label__0 and the nature of the universe has implications for unexplored regions of particle physics
__label__1 cosmology is the study of the character and evolution of the universe
__label__0 what are the major characteristics of the universe as we know them today
__label__0 
__label__0 the detection of what is now called the cosmic microwave background  cmbr  was so important  generally considered as important as hubble s detection that the galactic red shift is proportional to distance  that virtually every scientist has accepted the expansion of the universe as fact
__label__0 penzias and wilson shared the  nobel prize in physics for their discovery
__label__0 by   he had laid the foundation of general relativity  again almost on his own
__label__1 much of what einstein did to develop his ideas was to mentally analyze certain carefully and clearly defined situations  doing this is to perform a thought experiment
__label__0 link  illustrates a thought experiment like the ones that convinced einstein that light must fall in a gravitational field
__label__0 gravitational wavesif a massive object distorts the space around it  like the foot of a water bug on the surface of a pond  then movement of the massive object should create waves in space like those on a pond
__label__1 gravitational waves are mass  created distortions in space that propagate at the speed of light and are predicted by general relativity
__label__0 since gravity is by far the weakest force  extreme conditions are needed to generate significant gravitational waves
__label__0 this  until recently  was a question of whether there is enough gravitation to stop the expansion of the universe
__label__0 in the past few years  it has become a question of the combination of gravitation and what is called the cosmological constant
__label__0 the cosmological constant was invented by einstein to prohibit the expansion or contraction of the universe
__label__0 at the time he developed general relativity  einstein considered that an illogical possibility
__label__0 this means that if you travel far enough in any direction  you will return to your starting point  analogous to circumnavigating the earth
__label__0 in between these two is a flat  zero curvature  universe
__label__0 the recent discovery of the cosmological constant has shown the universe is very close to flat  and will expand forever
__label__0 the simple laws of physics apply  of course  but complex systems may reveal patterns that simple systems do not
__label__1 the emerging field of complexity is devoted to the study of complex systems  including those outside the traditional bounds of physics
__label__0 of particular interest is the ability of complex systems to adapt and evolve
__label__0 the characteristic sound of a motorcycle buzzing by is an example of the doppler effect
__label__0 the high  pitch scream shifts dramatically to a lower  pitch roar as the motorcycle passes by a stationary observer
__label__0 sonic booms are one example of a broader phenomenon called bow wakes
__label__1 a bow wake  such as the one in  link   is created when the wave source moves faster than the wave propagation speed
__label__0 water waves spread out in circles from the point where created  and the bow wake is the familiar v  shaped wake trailing the source
__label__0 energies produced by van de graaffs are insufficient to produce new particles  but they have been instrumental in exploring several aspects of the nucleus
__label__0 another  equally famous  early accelerator is the cyclotron  invented in  by the american physicist  e o lawrence
__label__0 for a visual representation with more detail  see  link
__label__0 one solution to this problem is to have head  on collisions between particles moving in opposite directions
__label__0 colliding beams are made to meet head  on at points where massive detectors are located
__label__0 the type of benefits provided differ according to the country and their specific type of governmental system  but governments commonly provide such things as education  health care  and an infrastructure for transportation
__label__1 the term politics refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals  especially those related to the division of resources within a nation
__label__1 representative government and capitalism developed together in the united states  and many americans tend to equate democracy  a political system in which people govern themselves  with capitalism
__label__0 in theory  a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled  for good or bad  by government
__label__0 therefore  some goods are provided by the government
__label__1 such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called public goods
__label__0 two such public goods are national security and education
__label__0 one of the many important things government does is regulate public access to common goods like natural resources
__label__1 unlike public goods  which all people may use without charge  common goods are in limited supply
__label__1 a democracy is a government in which political power  influence over institutions  leaders  and policies  rests in the hands of the people
__label__1 in a representative democracy  however  the citizens do not govern directly
__label__0 instead  they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people
__label__1 in a direct democracy  unlike representative democracy  people participate directly in making government decisions
__label__0 for example  in ancient athens  the most famous example of a direct democracy  all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the assembly
__label__1 many americans fear that a set of elite citizens is really in charge of government in the united states and that others have no influence
__label__0 this belief is called the elite theory of government
__label__1 in contrast to that perspective is the pluralist theory of government  which says that political power rests with competing interest groups who share influence in government
__label__0 in this way  government policy is shaped from the bottom up and not from the top down  as we see in elitist theory
__label__0 robert dahl  author of who governs   was one of the first to advance the pluralist theory  and argued that politicians seeking an  electoral payoff  are attentive to the concerns of politically active citizens and  through them  become acquainted with the needs of ordinary people
__label__0 they will attempt to give people what they want in exchange for their votes  dahl  who governs
__label__0 
__label__0 groups opposed to abortion argued that the buffer zone prevented them from speaking to women to try to persuade them not to have the procedure done
__label__1 in   in the case of mccullen v coakley  the us supreme court struck down the law that created a buffer zone between protestors and clinic entrances
__label__0 mccullen v coakley   us       melissa jeltsen   the reality of abortion clinics without buffer zones   the huffington post   july
__label__0 the federal government does not always side with those who oppose abortion  however
__label__0 several states have attempted to pass laws requiring women to notify their husbands  and often obtain their consent  before having an abortion
__label__0 civil rights legislation did not focus solely on the right to vote or to hold public office  it also integrated schools and public accommodations  prohibited discrimination in housing and employment  and increased access to higher education
__label__0 activists for women s rights fought for  and won  greater reproductive freedom for women  better wages  and access to credit
__label__0 only a few decades ago  homosexuality was considered a mental disorder  and intercourse between consenting adults of the same sex was illegal in many states
__label__0 may
__label__0 young americans are opting out of politics  but not because they re cynical   httpwwwpsmagcompoliticsandlawyoungpeoplearenotsopoliticallyinclined
__label__0 although they may not realize it  becoming active in the community and engaging in a wide variety of community  based volunteer efforts are important forms of civic engagement and help government do its job
__label__0 the demands on government are great  and funds do not always exist to enable it to undertake all the projects it may deem necessary
__label__0 however  their hopes were not realized
__label__1 hoping to prevent conflict with indian tribes in the ohio valley  parliament passed the proclamation of   which forbade the colonists to purchase land or settle west of the appalachian mountains
__label__0 franois furstenberg
__label__0 
__label__1 the sons of liberty circulated this sensationalized version of the events of march     in order to promote the rightness of their cause  it depicts british soldiers firing on unarmed civilians in the event that became known as the boston massacre
__label__0 later portrayals would more prominently feature crispus attucks  an african american who was one of the first to die
__label__1 in the early months of   parliament responded to this latest act of colonial defiance by passing a series of laws called the coercive acts  intended to punish boston for leading resistance to british rule and to restore order in the colonies
__label__0 these acts virtually abolished town meetings in massachusetts and otherwise interfered with the colony s ability to govern itself
__label__0 by this time  war with great britain had already begun  following skirmishes between colonial militiamen and british troops at lexington and concord  massachusetts
__label__0 congress drafted a declaration of causes explaining the colonies  reasons for rebellion
__label__0 on july     congress declared american independence from britain and two days later signed the declaration of independence
__label__1 the final draft of the articles of confederation  which formed the basis of the new nation s government  was accepted by congress in november  and submitted to the states for ratification
__label__0 it would not become the law of the land until all thirteen states had approved it
__label__0 following the declaration of independence  each of the thirteen states had drafted and ratified a constitution providing for a republican form of government in which political power rested in the hands of the people  although the right to vote was limited to free  white  men  and the property requirements for voting differed among the states
__label__0 each state had a governor and an elected legislature
__label__1 the weaknesses of the articles of confederation  already recognized by many  became apparent to all as a result of an uprising of massachusetts farmers  led by daniel shays
__label__0 known as shays  rebellion  the incident panicked the governor of massachusetts  who called upon the national government for assistance
__label__0 because all thirteen states had to agree to any alteration of the articles  the convention in annapolis could not accomplish its goal
__label__0 two of the delegates  alexander hamilton and james madison  requested that all states send delegates to a convention in philadelphia the following year to attempt once again to revise the articles of confederation
__label__0 all the states except rhode island chose delegates to send to the meeting  a total of seventy men in all  but many did not attend
__label__0 those who favored a nation free of the influence of slavery feared that southerners might attempt to make it a permanent part of american society
__label__0 the only decision that all could agree on was the election of george washington  the former commander of the continental army and hero of the american revolution  as the president of the convention
__label__0 delegates from small states objected to this virginia plan
__label__1 another proposal  the new jersey plan  called for a unicameral legislature with one house  in which each state would have one vote
__label__0 thus  smaller states would have the same power in the national legislature as larger states
__label__0 the first three articles divide the national government into three branches  congress  the executive branch  and the federal judiciary  and describe the powers and responsibilities of each
__label__0 in article i  ten sections describe the structure of congress  the basis for representation and the requirements for serving in congress  the length of congressional terms  and the powers of congress
__label__0 the national legislature created by the article reflects the compromises reached by the delegates regarding such issues as representation  slavery  and national power
__label__0 although debates over slavery and representation in congress occupied many at the convention  the chief concern was the challenge of increasing the authority of the national government while ensuring that it did not become too powerful
__label__0 the framers resolved this problem through a separation of powers  dividing the national government into three separate branches and assigning different responsibilities to each one  as shown in  link
__label__0 they also created a system of checks and balances by giving each of three branches of government the power to restrict the actions of the others  thus requiring them to work together
__label__0 the strongest guarantee that the power of the national government would be restricted and the states would retain a degree of sovereignty was the framers  creation of a federal system of government
__label__1 in a federal system  power is divided between the federal  or national  government and the state governments
__label__1 great or explicit powers  called enumerated powers  were granted to the federal government to declare war  impose taxes  coin and regulate currency  regulate foreign and interstate commerce  raise and maintain an army and a navy  maintain a post office  make treaties with foreign nations and with native american tribes  and make laws regulating the naturalization of immigrants
__label__0 although the states retained a considerable degree of sovereignty  the supremacy clause in article vi of the constitution proclaimed that the constitution  laws passed by congress  and treaties made by the federal government were  the supreme law of the land
__label__0 in the event of a conflict between the states and the national government  the national government would triumph
__label__0 furthermore  although the federal government was to be limited to those powers enumerated in the constitution  article i provided for the expansion of congressional powers if needed
__label__0 but many people resisted increasing the powers of the national government at the expense of the states
__label__0 virginia s patrick henry  for example  feared that the newly created office of president would place excessive power in the hands of one man
__label__0 he also disapproved of the federal government s new ability to tax its citizens
__label__0 on the question of ratification  citizens quickly separated into two groups  federalists and anti  federalists
__label__0 the federalists supported it
__label__1 they tended to be among the elite members of society  wealthy and well  educated landowners  businessmen  and former military commanders who believed a strong government would be better for both national defense and economic growth
__label__0 the constitution contained no provisions for government support of churches or of religious education  and article vi explicitly forbade the use of religious tests to determine eligibility for public office
__label__0 this caused many  like henry abbot of north carolina  to fear that government would be placed in the hands of  pagans
__label__0 
__label__0 furthermore  tyranny could not arise in a government in which  the legislature necessarily predominates
__label__1 finally  the desire of office holders in each branch of government to exercise the powers given to them  described as  personal motives   would encourage them to limit any attempt by the other branches to overstep their authority
__label__0 according to madison   ambition must be made to counteract ambition
__label__0 
__label__0 in fact  presidents long followed george washington s example and limited themselves to two terms
__label__1 only in   after franklin roosevelt had been elected four times  was the twenty  second amendment passed to restrict the presidency to two terms
__label__0 of these  only ten were accepted by three  quarters of the state legislatures
__label__1 in   these first ten amendments were added to the constitution and became known as the bill of rights
__label__0 the prohibition in the first amendment against the establishment of an official church by the federal government differed significantly from both english precedent and the practice of several states that had official churches
__label__1 the fourth amendment  which protects americans from unwarranted search and seizure of their property  was also new
__label__0 other amendments rectify problems that have arisen over the years or that reflect changing times
__label__1 for example  the seventeenth amendment  ratified in   gave voters the right to directly elect us senators
__label__1 the twentieth amendment  which was ratified in  during the great depression  moved the date of the presidential inauguration from march to january
__label__0 the thirteenth  fourteenth  and fifteenth amendments  ratified at the end of the civil war  changed the lives of african americans who had been held in slavery
__label__1 the thirteenth amendment abolished slavery in the united states
__label__1 the fourteenth amendment granted citizenship to african americans and equal protection under the law regardless of race or color
__label__1 the fifteenth amendment gave men the right to vote regardless of race or color  but women were still prohibited from voting in most states
__label__1 after many years of campaigns for suffrage  as shown in  link   the nineteenth amendment finally gave women the right to vote in
__label__0 the last great extension of the suffrage occurred in  in the midst of the vietnam war
__label__1 the twenty  sixth amendment reduced the voting age from twenty  one to eighteen
__label__0 many people had complained that the young men who were fighting in vietnam should have the right to vote for or against those making decisions that might literally mean life or death for them
__label__1 federalism is an institutional arrangement that creates two relatively autonomous levels of government  each possessing the capacity to act directly on behalf of the people with the authority granted to it by the national constitution
__label__0 see john kincaid
__label__0 
__label__0 division of power can also occur via a unitary structure or confederation   link
__label__1 in contrast to federalism  a unitary system makes subnational governments dependent on the national government  where significant authority is concentrated
__label__0 before the late s  the united kingdom s unitary system was centralized to the extent that the national government held the most important levers of power
__label__0 the constitution contains several provisions that direct the functioning of us federalism
__label__0 some delineate the scope of national and state power  while others restrict it
__label__0 what these anti  federalists sought was further assurance that the national government s capacity to act directly on behalf of the people would be restricted  which the first ten amendments  bill of rights  provided
__label__1 the tenth amendment affirms the states  reserved powers   the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution  nor prohibited by it to the states  are reserved to the states respectively  or to the people
__label__0 indeed  state constitutions had bills of rights  which the first congress used as the source for the first ten amendments to the constitution
__label__0 like the federal government  the states can not violate personal freedoms by suspending the writ of habeas corpus  passing bills of attainder  or enacting ex post facto laws
__label__1 furthermore  the fourteenth amendment  ratified in   prohibits the states from denying citizens the rights to which they are entitled by the constitution  due process of law  or the equal protection of the laws
__label__0 lastly  three civil rights amendments  the fifteenth  nineteenth  and twenty  sixth  prevent both the states and the federal government from abridging citizens  right to vote based on race  sex  and age
__label__0 the movement for marriage equality has put the full faith and credit clause to the test in recent decades
__label__1 in light of baehr v lewin  a  ruling in which the hawaii supreme court asserted that the state s ban on same  sex marriage was unconstitutional  a number of states became worried that they would be required to recognize those marriage certificates
__label__0 baehr v lewin
__label__0 
__label__0 although the data reflect  results  the patterns we see in the figure give us a good idea of how governments have funded their activities in recent years
__label__0 for the federal government   percent of  revenue came from individual income taxes and  percent from payroll taxes  which combine social security tax and medicare tax
__label__0 when the bank s charter expired in   jeffersonian democratic  republicans prevailed in blocking its renewal
__label__0 however  the fiscal hardships that plagued the government during the war of   coupled with the fragility of the country s financial system  convinced congress and then  president james madison to create the second bank of the united states in
__label__0 the supreme court also sided with the federal government on the issue of whether states could tax federal property
__label__1 under the supremacy clause of article vi  legitimate national laws trump conflicting state laws
__label__0 as the court observed   the government of the union  though limited in its powers  is supreme within its sphere of action and its laws  when made in pursuance of the constitution  form the supreme law of the land   maryland s action violated national supremacy because  the power to tax is the power to destroy
__label__1 this second ruling established the principle of national supremacy  which prohibits states from meddling in the lawful activities of the national government
__label__1 first  interstate commerce was interpreted broadly to mean  commercial intercourse  among states  thus allowing congress to regulate navigation
__label__1 second  because the federal licensing act of   which regulated coastal commerce  was a constitutional exercise of congress s authority under the commerce clause  federal law trumped the new york state license  monopoly law that had granted ogden an exclusive steamboat operating license
__label__0 as marshall pointed out   the acts of new york must yield to the law of congress  gibbons v ogden   us
__label__0 a nullification crisis emerged in the s over president andrew jackson s tariff acts of  and
__label__0 led by john calhoun  president jackson s vice president  nullifiers argued that high tariffs on imported goods benefited northern manufacturing interests while disadvantaging economies in the south
__label__0 south carolina passed an ordinance of nullification declaring both tariff acts null and void and threatened to leave the union
__label__1 prior to the conflict  in dred scott v sandford  the supreme court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories  dred scott v sandford   us
__label__0 but the election of president abraham lincoln in  led eleven southern states to secede from the united states because they believed the new president would challenge the institution of slavery
__label__1 what was initially a conflict to preserve the union became a conflict to end slavery when lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation in   freeing all slaves in the rebellious states
__label__0 the defeat of the south had a huge impact on the balance of power between the states and the national government in two important ways
__label__0 the late s ushered in a new phase in the evolution of us federalism
__label__1 under dual federalism  the states and national government exercise exclusive authority in distinctly delineated spheres of jurisdiction
__label__0 like the layers of a cake  the levels of government do not blend with one another but rather are clearly defined
__label__0 the great depression of the s brought economic hardships the nation had never witnessed before   link
__label__0 between  and   the national unemployment rate reached  percent  industrial output dropped by half  stock market assets lost more than half their value  thousands of banks went out of business  and the gross domestic product shrunk by one  quarter  nicholas crafts and peter fearon
__label__0 the new deal programs president franklin d roosevelt proposed as a means to tackle the great depression ran afoul of the dual  federalism mindset of the justices on the supreme court in the s
__label__0 the court struck down key pillars of the new deal  the national industrial recovery act and the agricultural adjustment act  for example  on the grounds that the federal government was operating in matters that were within the purview of the states
__label__0 the court s obstructionist position infuriated roosevelt  leading him in  to propose a court  packing plan that would add one new justice for each one over the age of seventy  thus allowing the president to make a maximum of six new appointments
__label__0 the new deal changed the relationship americans had with the national government
__label__0 before the great depression  the government offered little in terms of financial aid  social benefits  and economic rights
__label__1 after the new deal  it provided old  age pensions  social security   unemployment insurance  agricultural subsidies  protections for organizing in the workplace  and a variety of other public services created during roosevelt s administration
__label__0 nowhere is this clearer than with respect to the social welfare and social insurance programs created during the new deal and great society eras  most of which are administered by both state and federal authorities and are jointly funded
__label__1 the social security act of   which created federal subsidies for state  administered programs for the elderly  people with handicaps  dependent mothers  and children  gave state and local officials wide discretion over eligibility and benefit levels
__label__1 the unemployment insurance program  also created by the social security act  requires states to provide jobless benefits  but it allows them significant latitude to decide the level of tax to impose on businesses in order to fund the program as well as the duration and replacement rate of unemployment benefits
__label__1 new federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency  reduces overall public spending  and improves policy outcomes
__label__0 during nixon s administration  general revenue sharing programs were created that distributed funds to the state and local governments with minimal restrictions on how the money was spent
__label__0 the election of ronald reagan heralded the advent of a  devolution revolution  in us federalism  in which the president pledged to return authority to the states according to the constitution
__label__0 however  many would say that the years since the  attacks have swung the pendulum back in the direction of central federal power
__label__1 the creation of the department of homeland security federalized disaster response power in washington  and the transportation security administration was created to federalize airport security
__label__0 broad new federal policies and mandates have also been carried out in the form of the faith  based initiative and no child left behind  during the george w bush administration  and the affordable care act  during barack obama s administration
__label__0 the national government has used grants to influence state actions as far back as the articles of confederation when it provided states with land grants
__label__0 in the first half of the s  land grants were the primary means by which the federal government supported the states
__label__1 block grants come with less stringent federal administrative conditions and provide recipients more flexibility over how to spend grant funds
__label__1 examples of block grants include the workforce investment act program  which provides state and local agencies money to help youths and adults obtain skill sets that will lead to better  paying jobs  and the surface transportation program  which helps state and local governments maintain and improve highways  bridges  tunnels  sidewalks  and bicycle paths
__label__0 finally  recipients of general revenue sharing faced the least restrictions on the use of federal grants
__label__0 however  congressional efforts to convert aid to families with dependent children  afdc  to a block grant succeeded
__label__0 the temporary assistance for needy families  tanf  block grant replaced the afdc in   marking the first time the federal government transformed an entitlement program  which guarantees individual rights to benefits  into a block grant
__label__0 under the afdc  the federal government had reimbursed states a portion of the costs they bore for running the program without placing a ceiling on the amount
__label__1 for example  title vi of the civil rights act of  authorizes the federal government to withhold federal grants as well as file lawsuits against state and local officials for practicing racial discrimination

__label__0 the strategy anti  abortion advocates have used in recent years is another example of venue shopping
__label__1 in their attempts to limit abortion rights in the wake of the  roe v wade supreme court decision making abortion legal nationwide  anti  abortion advocates initially targeted congress in hopes of obtaining restrictive legislation
__label__0 roe v wade   us
__label__0 lack of progress at the national level prompted them to shift their focus to state legislators  where their advocacy efforts have been more successful
__label__0 by   for example  thirty  eight states required some form of parental involvement in a minor s decision to have an abortion  forty  six states allowed individual health  care providers to refuse to participate in abortions  and thirty  two states prohibited the use of public funds to carry out an abortion except when the woman s life is in danger or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest
__label__0 federalism also comes with drawbacks
__label__1 chief among them are economic disparities across states  race  to  the  bottom dynamics  ie  states compete to attract business by lowering taxes and regulations   and the difficulty of taking action on issues of national importance
__label__0 protests have erupted nationwide in response to the deaths of african americans during interactions with police
__label__0 many people were deeply troubled by the revelations of edward snowden   link   that us government agencies are conducting widespread surveillance  capturing not only the conversations of foreign leaders and suspected terrorists but also the private communications of us citizens  even those not suspected of criminal activity
__label__0 the idea that americans  indeed  people in general  have fundamental rights and liberties was at the core of the arguments in favor of their independence
__label__0 in writing the declaration of independence in   thomas jefferson drew on the ideas of john locke to express the colonists  belief that they had certain inalienable or natural rights that no ruler had the power or authority to deny to his or her subjects
__label__0 it was a scathing legal indictment of king george iii for violating the colonists  liberties
__label__0 indeed  the federalists did include in the constitution some protections against legislative acts that might restrict the liberties of citizens  based on the history of real and perceived abuses by both british kings and parliaments as well as royal governors
__label__0 in article i  section   the constitution limits the power of congress in three ways  prohibiting the passage of bills of attainder  prohibiting ex post facto laws  and limiting the ability of congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus
__label__1 finally  the writ of habeas corpus is used in our common  law legal system to demand that a neutral judge decide whether someone has been lawfully detained
__label__0 particularly in times of war  or even in response to threats against national security  the government has held suspected enemy agents without access to civilian courts  often without access to lawyers or a defense  seeking instead to try them before military tribunals or detain them indefinitely without trial
__label__0 the federalists reasoned that the limited set of enumerated powers of congress  along with the limitations on those powers in article i  section   would suffice  and no separate bill of rights was needed
__label__0 alexander hamilton  writing as publius in federalist no    argued that the constitution was  merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation   rather than to concern itself with  the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns
__label__0 hamilton went on to argue that listing some rights might actually be dangerous  because it would provide a pretext for people to claim that rights not included in such a list were not protected
__label__0 the anti  federalists believed provisions such as the elastic clause in article i  section   of the constitution would allow congress to legislate on matters well beyond the limited ones foreseen by the constitution s authors  thus  they held that a bill of rights was necessary
__label__0 one of the anti  federalists  brutus  whom most scholars believe to be robert yates  wrote   the powers  rights  and authority  granted to the general government by this constitution  are as complete  with respect to every object to which they extend  as that of any state government  it reaches to every thing which concerns human happiness  life  liberty  and property  are under its controul  sic

__label__0 constitution society   to the citizens of the state of new  york   httpwwwconstitutionorgafpbrutushtm  march
__label__0 the experience of the past two centuries has suggested that the anti  federalists may have been correct in this regard  while the states retain a great deal of importance  the scope and powers of the national government are much broader today than in likely beyond even the imaginings of the federalists themselves  the struggle to have rights clearly delineated and the decision of the framers to omit a bill of rights nearly derailed the ratification process
__label__0 in the decades following the constitution s ratification  the supreme court declined to expand the bill of rights to curb the power of the states  most notably in the  case of barron v baltimore  barron v baltimore   us
__label__1 in this case  which dealt with property rights under the fifth amendment  the supreme court unanimously decided that the bill of rights applied only to actions by the federal government
__label__0 explaining the court s ruling  chief justice john marshall wrote that it was incorrect to argue that  the constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments  as well as against that which might be attempted by their  federal  government

__label__0 to use an example from today  the punishment for speeding by an out  of  state driver can not be more severe than the punishment for an in  state driver
__label__0 legal scholars and the courts have extensively debated the meaning of this privileges or immunities clause over the years  some have argued that it was supposed to extend the entire bill of rights  or at least the first eight amendments  to the states  while others have argued that only some rights are extended
__label__1 in   justice john paul stevens  writing for a majority of the supreme court  argued in saenz v roe that the clause protects the right to travel from one state to another  saenz v roe   us
__label__1 more recently  justice clarence thomas argued in the  mcdonald v chicago ruling that the individual right to bear arms applied to the states because of this clause  mcdonald v chicago   us   the second provision of the fourteenth amendment that pertains to applying the bill of rights to the states is the due process clause  which says   nor shall any state deprive any person of life  liberty  or property  without due process of law
__label__1 this provision is similar to the fifth amendment in that it also refers to  due process   a term that generally means people must be treated fairly and impartially by government officials  or with what is commonly referred to as substantive due process
__label__0 beginning in   the supreme court has found that various provisions of the bill of rights protecting these fundamental liberties must be upheld by the states  even if their state constitutions and laws do not protect them as fully as the bill of rights does  or at all
__label__0 this means there has been a process of selective incorporation of the bill of rights into the practices of the states  in other words  the constitution effectively inserts parts of the bill of rights into state laws and constitutions  even though it does nt do so explicitly
__label__0 when cases arise to clarify particular issues and procedures  the supreme court decides whether state laws violate the bill of rights and are therefore unconstitutional
__label__0 another area in which the supreme court gradually moved to incorporate the bill of rights regards censorship and the fourteenth amendment
__label__1 in near v minnesota     the court disagreed with state courts regarding censorship and ruled it unconstitutional except in rare cases
__label__0 near v minnesota   us
__label__0 the first of these two freedoms is known as the establishment clause
__label__1 congress is prohibited from creating or promoting a state  sponsored religion  this now includes the states too
__label__0 but some laws that may appear to establish certain religious practices are allowed
__label__1 for example  the courts have permitted religiously inspired blue laws that limit working hours or even shutter businesses on sunday  the christian day of rest  because by allowing people to practice their  christian  faith  such rules may help ensure the  health  safety  recreation  and general well  being  of citizens
__label__0 they have allowed restrictions on the sale of alcohol and sometimes other goods on sunday for similar reasons
__label__0 to avoid serving in the vietnam war  many people claimed to have a conscientious objection to military service on the basis that they believed this particular war was unwise or unjust
__label__1 however  the supreme court ruled in gillette v united states that to claim to be a conscientious objector  a person must be opposed to serving in any war  not just some wars  gillette v united states   us
__label__0 in   the supreme court made a controversial decision substantially narrowing the sherbert test in employment division v smith  more popularly known as  the peyote case
__label__0 employment division  department of human resources of oregon v smith   us
__label__1 this case involved two men who were members of the native american church  a religious organization that uses the hallucinogenic peyote plant as part of its sacraments
__label__0 after being arrested for possession of peyote  the two men were fired from their jobs as counselors at a private drug rehabilitation clinic
__label__0 such a conflict emerged in the  supreme court case known as burwell v hobby lobby  burwell v hobby lobby stores  inc   us
__label__0 the hobby lobby chain of stores sells arts and crafts merchandise at hundreds of stores  its founder  david green  is a devout fundamentalist christian whose beliefs include opposition to abortion and contraception
__label__1 consistent with these beliefs  he used his business to object to a provision of the patient protection and affordable care act  aca or obamacare  requiring employer  backed insurance plans to include no  charge access to the morning  after pill  a form of emergency contraception  arguing that this requirement infringed on his conscience
__label__0 based in part on the federal rfra  the supreme court agreed  with green and hobby lobby s position and said that hobby lobby and other closely held businesses did not have to provide employees free access to emergency contraception or other birth control if doing so would violate the religious beliefs of the business  owners  because there were other less restrictive ways the government could ensure access to these services for hobby lobby s employees  eg  paying for them directly
__label__0 americans who vocally supported the communist cause or opposed the war often found themselves in jail
__label__1 in schenck v united states  the supreme court ruled that people encouraging young men to dodge the draft could be imprisoned for doing so  arguing that recommending that people disobey the law was tantamount to  falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic  and thus presented a  clear and present danger  to public order  schenck v united states   us
__label__0 similarly  communists and other revolutionary anarchists and socialists during the red scare after the war were prosecuted under various state and federal laws for supporting the forceful or violent overthrow of government
__label__0 this general approach to political speech remained in place for the next fifty years
__label__0 he was arrested  charged with  desecration of a venerated object   among other offenses   and eventually convicted of that offense
__label__1 however  in   the supreme court decided in texas v johnson that burning the flag was a form of symbolic speech protected by the first amendment and found the law  as applied to flag desecration  to be unconstitutional  texas v johnson   us
__label__1 in near v minnesota  an early case regarding press freedoms  the supreme court ruled that the government generally could not engage in prior restraint  that is  states and the federal government could not in advance prohibit someone from publishing something without a very compelling reason  near v minnesota   us
__label__0 this standard was reinforced in  in the pentagon papers case  in which the supreme court found that the government could not prohibit the new york times and washington post newspapers from publishing the pentagon papers  new york times co v united states   us
__label__0 these papers included materials from a secret history of the vietnam war that had been compiled by the military
__label__1 more specifically  the papers were compiled at the request of secretary of defense robert mcnamara and provided a study of us political and military involvement in vietnam from  to
__label__0 daniel ellsberg famously released passages of the papers to the press to show that the united states had secretly enlarged the scope of the war by bombing cambodia and laos among other deeds while lying to the american public about doing so
__label__0 furthermore  the courts have recognized that government officials and other public figures might try to silence press criticism and avoid unfavorable news coverage by threatening a lawsuit for defamation of character
__label__1 in the  new york times v sullivan case  the supreme court decided that public figures needed to demonstrate not only that a negative press statement about them was untrue but also that the statement was published or made with either malicious intent or  reckless disregard  for the truth  new york times v sullivan   us

__label__1 economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity
__label__0 these can be individual decisions  family decisions  business decisions or societal decisions
__label__0 many authors had written on economics in the centuries before smith  but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way
__label__1 in the first chapter  smith introduces the division of labor  which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers  instead of all the tasks being done by the same person
__label__0 how can macroeconomic policy be used to pursue these goals
__label__1 monetary policy  which involves policies that affect bank lending  interest rates  and financial capital markets  is conducted by a nation s central bank
__label__0 for the united states  this is the federal reserve
__label__0 they analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior  that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use
__label__1 a theory is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other
__label__0 the purpose of a theory is to take a complex  real  world issue and simplify it down to its essentials
__label__0 a good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram  which is shown in  link
__label__1 it pictures the economy as consisting of two groups  households and firms  that interact in two markets  the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees
__label__0 although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions  market economies have a very decentralized structure
__label__1 a market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services  who may be either individuals or businesses
__label__0 the new york stock exchange  shown in  link   is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together
__label__1 exports are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad
__label__1 imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically
__label__1 the size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product  gdp
__label__1 economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what must be given up to obtain something that is desired
__label__0 the idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else  in short  opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative
__label__0 people desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide
__label__0 utility  as we will see in the chapter on consumer choices  is subjective but that does not make it less real
__label__0 just as individuals can not have everything they want and must instead make choices  society as a whole can not have everything it might want  either
__label__0 this section of the chapter will explain the constraints faced by society  using a model called the production possibilities frontier  ppf
__label__0 there are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice
__label__1 this pattern is common enough that it has been given a name  the law of diminishing returns  which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose  the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline
__label__0 when government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime  for example  the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large
__label__1 allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires
__label__0 how to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question  and is usually discussed in political science  sociology  and philosophy classes as well as in economics
__label__0 rather  it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually exists
__label__0 philosophers draw a distinction between positive statements  which describe the world as it is  and normative statements  which describe how the world should be
__label__0 for example  an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city
__label__0 but even if the budget constraint or a ppf shifts  scarcity remains  just at a different level
__label__0 the second theme is tradeoffs
__label__0 as depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier  it is necessary to give up some of one good to gain more of the other good
__label__0 finally  the statistics introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices
__label__0 an economist might say that people choose not to get a college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college  and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today
__label__1 price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded  qd  or supplied  qs  and the corresponding percent change in price
__label__1 the price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price
__label__1 the price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price
__label__0 elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories  elastic  inelastic  and unitary
__label__1 an elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one  indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price
__label__1 elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply
__label__1 unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply  as summarized in  link
__label__0 recall that the elasticity between these two points was
__label__0 demand was inelastic between points a and b and elastic between points g and h this shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a straight  line demand curve
__label__1 zero elasticity or perfect inelasticity  as depicted in  link  refers to the extreme case in which a percentage change in price  no matter how large  results in zero change in quantity
__label__0 while a perfectly inelastic supply is an extreme example  goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves
__label__0 the example of cigarette taxes showed that because demand is inelastic  taxes are not effective at reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking  and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices
__label__1 the analysis  or manner  of how the burden of a tax is divided between consumers and producers is called tax incidence
__label__0 typically  the incidence  or burden  of a tax falls both on the consumers and producers of the taxed good
__label__0 the cross  price elasticity of demand puts some meat on the bones of these ideas
__label__1 the term  cross  price  refers to the idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good
__label__0 let s define what is meant by the firm
__label__1 a firm  or business  combines inputs of labor  capital  land  and raw or finished component materials to produce outputs
__label__0 if the firm is successful  the outputs are more valuable than the inputs
__label__0 we can distinguish between two types of cost  explicit and implicit
__label__1 explicit costs are out  of  pocket costs  that is  payments that are actually made
__label__0 wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs
__label__0 it means total revenue minus explicit costs  the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out
__label__1 economic profit is total revenue minus total cost  including both explicit and implicit costs
__label__0 the difference is important because even though a business pays income taxes based on its accounting profit  whether or not it is economically successful depends on its economic profit
__label__1 fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of production  at least not in the short term
__label__0 whether you produce a lot or a little  the fixed costs are the same
__label__1 average total cost  sometimes referred to simply as average cost  is total cost divided by the quantity of output
__label__0 since the total cost of producing  haircuts is    the average total cost for producing each of  haircuts is    or   per haircut
__label__1 finally  the right  hand portion of the long  run average cost curve  running from output level q to q  shows a situation where  as the level of output and the scale rises  average costs rise as well
__label__0 this situation is called diseconomies of scale
__label__0 a firm or a factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to manage  resulting in unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each other  and as failures to communicate lead to disruptions in the flow of work and materials
__label__1 what a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price
__label__1 the total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded
__label__1 when economists talk about supply  they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price
__label__1 price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service
__label__0 a rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service  while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied
__label__0 like demand  supply can be illustrated using a table or a graph
__label__1 a supply schedule is a table  like  link   that shows the quantity supplied at a range of different prices
__label__0 again  price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons
__label__1 the point where the supply curve  s  and the demand curve  d  cross  designated by point e in  link   is called the equilibrium
__label__1 the equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree  that is  where the amount of the product consumers want to buy  quantity demanded  is equal to the amount producers want to sell  quantity supplied
__label__1 the equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree  that is  where the amount of the product consumers want to buy  quantity demanded  is equal to the amount producers want to sell  quantity supplied
__label__0 this common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity
__label__1 when the price is below equilibrium  there is excess demand  or a shortage  that is  at the given price the quantity demanded  which has been stimulated by the lower price  now exceeds the quantity supplied  which had been depressed by the lower price
__label__0 in this situation  eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations  only to find many stations running short of fuel
__label__1 the assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors  other than the product s price  are changing
__label__0 economists call this assumption ceteris paribus  a latin phrase meaning  other things being equal
__label__0 any given demand or supply curve is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that all else is held equal
__label__0 a demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two  and only two  variables when all other variables are kept constant
__label__0 the proportion of elderly citizens in the united states population is rising
__label__0 it rose from   in  to   in   and will be a projected  by the us census bureau    of the population by
__label__0 these changes in demand are shown as shifts in the curve
__label__0 therefore  a shift in demand happens when a change in some economic factor  other than price  causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price
__label__0 the following work it out feature shows how this happens
__label__0 for example  in  the manchurian plain in northeastern china  which produces most of the country s wheat  corn  and soybeans  experienced its most severe drought in  years
__label__0 a drought decreases the supply of agricultural products  which means that at any given price  a lower quantity will be supplied  conversely  especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right
__label__0 when a firm discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost  the supply curve will shift to the right  as well
__label__0 for instance  in the s a major scientific effort nicknamed the green revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice
__label__0 well  it is clear that a drought reduces supply  so i will shift back the supply curve  as in the shift from the original supply curve s to s shown on the diagram  called shift
__label__0 so the equilibrium moves from e to e  the equilibrium quantity is lower and the equilibrium price is higher
__label__0 then  a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good  so the supply curve shifts right  as shown by the shift from s to s  on the diagram  shown as shift    so that the equilibrium now moves from e to e
__label__0 the most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product  adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be
__label__0 according to the common agricultural policy reform passed in   the european union  eu  will spend about  billion euros per year  or  billion dollars per year  or roughly   of the eu budget  on price supports for europe s farmers from  to
__label__0 link  illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for wheat in europe
__label__0 in the absence of government intervention  the price would adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point e  with price p and quantity q
__label__0 at that above  equilibrium salary  excess supply or a surplus results
__label__0 in a situation of excess supply in the labor market  with many applicants for every job opening  employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have
__label__0 nurses  salary will move down toward equilibrium  in contrast  if the salary is below the equilibrium at  say    per year  then a situation of excess demand or a shortage arises
__label__0 in mid   the us minimum wage was raised to   per hour
__label__0 local political movements in a number of us cities have pushed for a higher minimum wage  which they call a living wage
__label__0 promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure a reasonable standard of living
__label__0 the laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets
__label__1 according to the law of demand  a higher rate of return  that is  a higher price  will decrease the quantity demanded
__label__0 as the interest rate rises  consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow
__label__0 instead  each consumer reacts according to that person s preferences and budget set  and each profit  seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits
__label__0 the following clear it up feature examines the demand and supply models
__label__0 to understand how a household will make its choices  economists look at what consumers can afford  as shown in a budget constraint line  and the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices
__label__1 in a budget constraint line  the quantity of one good is measured on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good is measured on the vertical axis
__label__0 the most common pattern of total utility  as shown here  is that consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility  but at a decreasing rate
__label__1 the third column shows marginal utility  which is the additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption
__label__0 this equation for marginal utility is  mu  change in total utility change in quantity mu  change in total utility change in quantity
__label__0 notice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed  which means that each subsequent unit of a good consumed provides less additional utility
__label__0 this process of decision making suggests a rule to follow when maximizing utility
__label__0 since the price of t  shirts is twice as high as the price of movies  to maximize utility the last t  shirt chosen needs to provide exactly twice the marginal utility  mu  of the last movie
__label__0 how does this rise in income alter her utility  maximizing choice
__label__0 kimberly will again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from concert tickets and overnight getaways and seek her utility  maximizing choice on the new budget line
__label__0 but how will her new choice relate to her original choice
__label__0 this occurs for two reasons  and both effects can occur simultaneously
__label__1 the substitution effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price
__label__1 the income effect is that a higher price means  in effect  the buying power of income has been reduced  even though actual income has not changed   which leads to buying less of the good  when the good is normal
__label__0 again  let s proceed with a concrete example
__label__0 the economic logic is precisely the same as in the case of a consumption choice budget constraint  but the labels are different on a labor  leisure budget constraint
__label__0 link  and  link  show yelberton s intertemporal budget constraint
__label__0 yelberton s choice involves comparing the utility of present consumption during his working life and future consumption after retirement
__label__0 and what s more  actions under these conditions are indeed predictable  if the underlying environment is better understood
__label__1 so  behavioral economics seeks to enrich the understanding of decision  making by integrating the insights of psychology into economics
__label__0 it does this by investigating how given dollar amounts can mean different things to individuals depending on the situation
__label__1 industries differ from one another in terms of how many sellers there are in a specific market  how easy or difficult it is for a new firm to enter  and the type of products that are sold
__label__0 this is referred to as the market structure of the industry
__label__0 in this chapter  we focus on perfect competition
__label__0 a perfectly competitive firm has only one major decision to make  namely  what quantity to produce
__label__0 to understand why this is so  consider a different way of writing out the basic definition of profit
__label__0 in this example  the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves cross at a price of   and a quantity of  produced
__label__0 if the farmer started out producing at a level of   and then experimented with increasing production to   marginal revenues from the increase in production would exceed marginal costs  and so profits would rise
__label__0 no perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price
__label__0 however  the combination of many firms entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market
__label__1 for an increasing cost industry  as the market expands  the old and new firms experience increases in their costs of production  which makes the new zero  profit level intersect at a higher price than before
__label__0 here companies may have to deal with limited inputs  such as skilled labor
__label__0 to explore what is meant by allocative efficiency  it is useful to walk through an example
__label__0 begin by assuming that the market for wholesale flowers is perfectly competitive  and so p  mc
__label__0 there are two types of monopoly  based on the types of barriers to entry they exploit
__label__1 one is natural monopoly  where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition
__label__1 the other is legal monopoly  where laws prohibit  or severely limit  competition
__label__0 copyright office
__label__1 a patent gives the inventor the exclusive legal right to make  use  or sell the invention for a limited time  in the united states  exclusive patent rights last for  years
__label__0 the idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup their investment in rd  but then to allow other firms to produce the product more cheaply once the patent expires
__label__0 but in certain areas  like the invention of new software  it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection should apply
__label__0 there is also a body of law known as trade secrets
__label__0 even if a company does not have a patent on an invention  competing firms are not allowed to steal their secrets
__label__0 businesses have developed a number of schemes for creating barriers to entry by deterring potential competitors from entering the market
__label__1 one method is known as predatory pricing  in which a firm uses the threat of sharp price cuts to discourage competition
__label__0 predatory pricing is a violation of us antitrust law  but it is difficult to prove
__label__0 for a perfect competitor  each additional unit sold brought a positive marginal revenue  because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price
__label__0 but a monopolist can sell a larger quantity and see a decline in total revenue
__label__0 when a monopolist increases sales by one unit  it gains some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit  but also loses some marginal revenue because every other unit must now be sold at a lower price
__label__0 a perfectly competitive market has many firms selling identical products  who all act as price takers in the face of the competition
__label__1 if you recall  price takers are firms that have no market power
__label__0 they simply have to take the market price as given
__label__0 crew  and nordstrom s   plus  more stores that sold women s specialty clothing  like motherhood maternity and victoria s secret
__label__0 most of the markets that consumers encounter at the retail level are monopolistically competitive
__label__0 the other type of imperfectly competitive market is oligopoly
__label__1 oligopolistic markets are those dominated by a small number of firms
__label__0 some intangible aspects may be promises like a guarantee of satisfaction or money back  a reputation for high quality  services like free delivery  or offering a loan to purchase the product
__label__0 finally  product differentiation may occur in the minds of buyers
__label__0 for example  many people could not tell the difference in taste between common varieties of beer or cigarettes if they were blindfolded but  because of past habits and advertising  they have strong preferences for certain brands
__label__0 although the process by which a monopolistic competitor makes decisions about quantity and price is similar to the way in which a monopolist makes such decisions  two differences are worth remembering
__label__0 first  although both a monopolist and a monopolistic competitor face downward  sloping demand curves  the monopolist s perceived demand curve is the market demand curve  while the perceived demand curve for a monopolistic competitor is based on the extent of its product differentiation and how many competitors it faces
__label__0 second  a monopolist is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry  but a monopolistic competitor who earns profits must expect the entry of firms with similar  but differentiated  products
__label__0 thus  although a monopolistically competitive firm may earn positive economic profits in the short term  the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the long run
__label__0 remember that zero economic profit is not equivalent to zero accounting profit
__label__1 a zero economic profit means the firm s accounting profit is equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use
__label__0 rather  they are oligopolies
__label__1 oligopoly arises when a small number of large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry
__label__0 examples of oligopoly abound and include the auto industry  cable television  and commercial air travel
__label__0 by acting together  oligopolistic firms can hold down industry output  charge a higher price  and divide up the profit among themselves
__label__1 when firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high  it is called collusion
__label__1 a group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel
__label__0 the desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can instead raise the prices that they charge and earn higher profits has been well understood by economists
__label__0 adam smith wrote in wealth of nations in    people of the same trade seldom meet together  even for merriment and diversion  but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public  or in some contrivance to raise prices
__label__0 each oligopolist  however  must worry that while it is holding down output  other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and earning higher profits
__label__1 link  shows the prisoner s dilemma for a two  firm oligopoly  known as a duopoly
__label__0 if firms a and b both agree to hold down output  they are acting together as a monopoly and will each earn   in profits
__label__1 one example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the kinked demand curve  in which competing oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts  but not price increases
__label__0 this situation is shown in  link
__label__0 a corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm
__label__1 when one firm purchases another  it is called an acquisition
__label__1 in many cases  these large firms were organized in the legal form of a  trust   in which a group of formerly independent firms were consolidated together by mergers and purchases  and a group of  trustees  then ran the companies as if they were a single firm
__label__0 thus  when the us government passed the sherman antitrust act in  to limit the power of these trusts  it was called an antitrust law
__label__0 in an early demonstration of the law s power  the us supreme court in  upheld the government s right to break up standard oil  which had controlled about   of the country s oil refining  into  independent firms  including exxon  mobil  amoco  and chevron
__label__0 regulators have struggled for decades to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry
__label__1 an early tool was the concentration ratio  which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms  typically the top four to eight firms
__label__0 for an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy  refer to monopoly
__label__1 say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has  firms with the market shares shown in  link   where the market share is each firm s proportion of total sales in that market
__label__0 defining a market is often controversial
__label__0 for example  microsoft in the early s had a dominant share of the software for computer operating systems
__label__1 antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices  practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced  but that might have the effect of reducing competition
__label__0 antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial  because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others  for example  if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement  which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price
__label__1 tying sales happen when a customer is required to buy one product only if the customer also buys a second product
__label__0 tying sales are controversial because they force consumers to purchase a product that they may not actually want or need
__label__0 all sides agreed that the capabilities of computer software that was compatible with windows  both software produced by microsoft and that produced by other companies  had expanded dramatically in the s
__label__0 having a monopoly or a near  monopoly is not necessarily illegal in and of itself  but in cases where one company controls a great deal of the market  antitrust regulators look at any allegations of restrictive practices with special care
__label__0 the regulators will try to choose a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and the broader social interest
__label__0 point c illustrates one tempting choice  the regulator requires that the firm produce the quantity of output where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of   and charge the price of   which is equal to marginal cost at that point
__label__0 this rule is appealing because it requires price to be set equal to marginal cost  which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive market  and it would assure consumers a higher quantity and lower price than at the monopoly choice a
__label__0 beginning in the s  it became clear to policymakers of all political leanings that the existing price regulation was not working well
__label__1 the united states carried out a great policy experiment  the deregulation discussed in monopoly  removing government controls over prices and quantities produced in airlines  railroads  trucking  intercity bus travel  natural gas  and bank interest rates
__label__0 the clear it up discusses the outcome of deregulation in one industry in particular  airlines
__label__0 what are the results of airline deregulation
__label__1 the collapse of the markets for these assets precipitated the financial crisis and led to the failure of lehman brothers  a major investment bank  numerous large commercial banks  such as wachovia  and even the federal national mortgage corporation  fannie mae   which had to be nationalized  that is  taken over by the federal government
__label__0 one response to the financial crisis was the dodd  frank act  which attempted major reforms of the financial system
__label__0 the legislation s purpose  as noted on doddfrankcom is
__label__1 the effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or  external  to the exchange is called an externality
__label__0 because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved  they are sometimes called spillovers  externalities can be negative or positive
__label__0 if you hate country music  then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality
__label__0 pollution is a negative externality
__label__0 economists illustrate the social costs of production with a demand and supply diagram
__label__1 the social costs include the private costs of production incurred by the company and the external costs of pollution that are passed on to society
__label__0 however  when the externality of pollution exists  the supply curve no longer represents all social costs
__label__0 because externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs  but only some of them  economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of market failure
__label__1 when there is market failure  the private market fails to achieve efficient output  because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output andor consumers do not account for all benefits obtained  a positive externality
__label__0 in the same year  the clean air act was enacted to address air pollution
__label__0 just two years later  in   congress passed and the president signed the far  reaching clean water act
__label__0 these command  and  control environmental laws  and their amendments and updates  have been largely responsible for america s cleaner air and water in recent decades
__label__0 when a city or state government sets up a marketable permit program  eg cap  and  trade   it must start by determining the overall quantity of pollution it will allow as it tries to meet national pollution standards
__label__0 however  it also found that a middle  range estimate of the health and other benefits from cleaner air was   trillion  about  times higher than the costs
__label__0 a more recent study by the epa estimated that the environmental benefits to americans from the clean air act will exceed their costs by a margin of four to one
__label__0 the epa estimated that  in  the benefits of clean air act programs will total about   billion
__label__0 however  as the extent of environmental protection increases  the cheap and easy ways of reducing pollution begin to decrease  and more costly methods must be used
__label__0 the marginal cost curve rises
__label__0 also  as environmental protection increases  the largest marginal benefits are achieved first  followed by reduced marginal benefits
__label__0 however  low  income countries  with some understandable exasperation  point out that high  income countries do not have much moral standing to lecture them on the necessities of putting environmental protection ahead of economic growth
__label__0 after all  high  income countries have historically been the primary contributors to greenhouse warming by burning fossil fuels  and still are today
__label__0 it is hard to tell people who are living in a low  income country  where adequate diet  health care  and education are lacking  that they should sacrifice an improved quality of life for a cleaner environment
__label__1 depending on their different income levels and political preferences  countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency  that is  the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier
__label__0 however  all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency  that is  the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it
__label__0 in certain cases  however  competition can discourage new technology  especially when other firms can quickly copy a new idea
__label__0 consider a pharmaceutical firm deciding to develop a new drug
__label__0 however  when a firm invests in new technology  the private benefits  or profits  that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits
__label__1 the social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product  whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole  as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology
__label__1 as you learned in environmental protection and negative externalities  positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party  or parties  consider the example of the big drug company  which is planning its rd budget for the next year
__label__0 data in  link   from the us bureau of labor statistics  usual weekly earnings of wage and salary workers  third quarter   demonstrate that median weekly earnings are higher for workers who have completed more education
__label__0 while these rates of return will beat equivalent investments in treasury bonds or savings accounts  the estimated returns to education go primarily to the individual worker  so these returns are private rates of return to education
__label__0 the first row is a header row and it labels the last three columns   less than a high school degree    high school degree  no college   and  bachelor s degree
__label__0 one way to increase new technology is to guarantee the innovator an exclusive right to that new product or process
__label__1 intellectual property rights include patents  which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make  use  or sell the invention for a limited time  and copyright laws  which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of literature  music  film  video  and pictures
__label__0 for example  if a pharmaceutical firm has a patent on a new drug  then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for twenty  one years  unless the firm with the patent grants permission
__label__1 for example  united for medical research  a coalition of groups that seek funding for the national institutes of health   which is supported by federal grants   states   nih  supported research added   billion to our gdp and supported seven million jobs in  alone
__label__0 the united states remains the leading sponsor of medical  related research spending   billion in
__label__0 other institutions  such as the national academy of scientists and the national academy of engineers  receive federal grants for innovative projects
__label__0 the agriculture and food research initiative  afri  at the united states department of agriculture awards federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most important agricultural problems  from food safety to childhood obesity
__label__0 instead  public goods have two defining characteristics  they are nonexcludable and nonrivalrous
__label__1 the first characteristic  that a public good is nonexcludable  means that it is costly or impossible to exclude someone from using the good
__label__0 comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues  economic inequality and poverty
__label__1 poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income  called the poverty line  that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living
__label__1 poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income  called the poverty line  that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living
__label__0 in the united states  the official definition of the poverty line traces back to a single person  mollie orshansky
__label__0 in   orshansky  who was working for the social security administration  published an article called  children of the poor  in a highly useful and dry  as  dust publication called the social security bulletin
__label__0 as a result  the person experiences no net gain for working
__label__0 economists call this problem the poverty trap
__label__1 the us government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who have incomes just above the poverty line  who are referred to as the near  poor
__label__1 the us government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who have incomes just above the poverty line  who are referred to as the near  poor
__label__0 such programs are called the safety net  in recognition of the fact that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income
__label__1 from the great depression of the s until   the united states  most visible antipoverty program was aid to families with dependent children  afdc   which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the poverty line
__label__0 this program was often just called  welfare   in   congress passed and president bill clinton signed into law the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act  more commonly called the  welfare reform act   the new law replaced afdc with temporary assistance for needy families  tanf
__label__1 often called  food stamps   supplemental nutrition assistance program  snap  is a federally funded program  started in   in which each month poor people receive a card like a debit card that they can use to buy food
__label__0 the amount of food aid for which a household is eligible varies by income  number of children  and other factors but  in general  households are expected to spend about   of their own net income on food  and if   of their net income is not enough to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet  then those households are eligible for snap
__label__0 snap can contribute to the poverty trap
__label__1 medicaid was created by congress in  and is a joint health insurance program entered into by both the states and the federal government
__label__0 the federal government helps fund medicaid  but each state is responsible for administering the program  determining the level of benefits  and determining eligibility
__label__0 for example  you could draw a bar graph that showed the share of income going to each fifth of the income distribution
__label__0 link  presents an alternative way of showing inequality data in what is called a lorenz curve
__label__1 the lorenz curve shows the cumulative share of population on the horizontal axis and the cumulative percentage of total income received on the vertical axis
__label__0 public policy can attempt to build a ladder of opportunities so that  even though all children will never come from identical families and attend identical schools  each child has a reasonable opportunity to attain an economic niche in society based on their interests  desires  talents  and efforts
__label__0 some of those initiatives include those shown in  link
__label__1 a labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to deal with workers collectively  rather than as individuals
__label__1 thus  negotiations between unions and firms are sometimes called collective bargaining  the subject of labor unions can be controversial
__label__0 supporters of labor unions view them as the workers  primary line of defense against efforts by profit  seeking firms to hold down wages and benefits
__label__0 two key issues in the dispute were the desire of the shipping companies and port operators to use handheld scanners for record  keeping and computer  operated cabs for loading and unloading ships  changes which the union opposed  along with overtime pay
__label__1 president obama threatened to use the labor management relations act of   commonly known as the taft  hartley act  where a court can impose an   day  cooling  off period  in order to allow time for negotiations to proceed without the threat of a work stoppage
__label__0 federal mediators were called in  and the two sides agreed to a deal in february
__label__0 the close connection between union membership and a friendly legal environment is apparent in the history of us unions
__label__1 the great rise in union membership in the s followed the passage of the national labor  management relations act of   which specified that workers had a right to organize unions and that management had to give them a fair chance to do so
__label__0 the us government strongly encouraged the formation of unions during the early s in the belief that unions would help to coordinate the all  out production efforts needed during world war ii
__label__0 investigating the black  white earnings gapblacks experienced blatant labor market discrimination during much of the twentieth century
__label__0 until the passage of the civil rights act of   it was legal in many states to refuse to hire a black worker  regardless of the credentials or experience of that worker
__label__0 moreover  blacks were often denied access to educational opportunities  which in turn meant that they had lower levels of qualifications for many jobs
__label__1 the civil rights act of  prohibits employment discrimination based on race  color  religion  sex  or national origin
__label__1 the age discrimination in employment act of  prohibited discrimination on the basis of age against individuals who are  years of age or older
__label__1 the civil rights act of  provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination
__label__0 today  affirmative action policies are applied only to federal contractors who have lost a discrimination lawsuit
__label__0 this type of redress is enforced by the federal equal employment opportunity commission  eeoc
__label__1 in august   many members of the us congress used their summer recess to return to their home districts and hold town hall  style meetings to discuss president obama s proposed changes to the us healthcare system
__label__0 this was officially known as the patient protection and affordable care act  ppaca  or as the affordable care act  aca   but was more popularly known as obamacare
__label__0 the bill s opponents  claims ranged from the charge that the changes were unconstitutional and would add   billion to the deficit  to extreme claims about the inclusion of things like the implantation of microchips and so  called  death panels  that decide which critically  ill patients receive care and which do not
__label__1 also  the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information  in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction
__label__0 let s begin with some examples of how imperfect information complicates transactions in goods  labor  and financial capital markets
__label__0 the presence of imperfect information can easily cause a decline in prices or quantities of products sold
__label__1 a market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as a thin market
__label__1 by contrast  a market with many buyers and sellers is called a thick market
__label__0 when imperfect information is severe and buyers and sellers are discouraged from participating  markets may become extremely thin as a relatively small number of buyer and sellers attempt to communicate enough information that they can agree on a price
__label__0 if only you knew more economics  you would not be so irrational   is what many mainstream economists seem to be saying
__label__0 a group known as behavioral economists has challenged this notion  because so much of this so  called  quirky  behavior is extremely common among us
__label__0 for example  a conventional economist would say that if you lost a   bill today  and also got an extra   in your paycheck  you should feel perfectly neutral
__label__1 sellers may offer a warranty  which is a promise to fix or replace the good  at least for a certain period of time
__label__1 the seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract  where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period
__label__0 service contracts are often used with large purchases such as cars  appliances and even houses
__label__0 in the financial capital market  before a bank makes a loan  it requires a prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income  in addition  the bank conducts a credit check on the individual s past borrowing
__label__1 another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan  that is  another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so
__label__1 insurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental financial effect
__label__1 generally  households or firms with insurance make regular payments  called premiums
__label__1 unemployment insurance  employers in every state pay a small amount for unemployment insurance  which goes into a fund that is used to pay benefits to workers for a period of time  usually six months  after they lose their jobs
__label__1 workman s compensation insurance  employers are required by law to pay a small percentage of the salaries that they pay into funds  typically run at the state level  that are used to pay benefits to workers who suffer an injury on the job
__label__1 moral hazard refers to the case when people engage in riskier behavior with insurance than they would if they did not have insurance
__label__0 for example  if you have health insurance that covers the cost of visiting the doctor  you may be less likely to take precautions against catching an illness that might require a doctor s visit
__label__1 health insurance policies often have a copayment  in which the policyholder must pay a small amount  for example  a person might have to pay   for each doctor visit  and the insurance company would cover the rest
__label__1 another method of cost  sharing is coinsurance  which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost
__label__0 for example  insurance might pay for   of the costs of repairing a home after a fire  but the homeowner would pay the other
__label__1 adverse selection refers to the problem in which the buyers of insurance have more information about whether they are high  risk or low  risk than the insurance company does
__label__0 this creates an asymmetric information problem for the insurance company because buyers who are high  risk tend to want to buy more insurance  without letting the insurance company know about their higher risk
__label__0 in march of   president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  ppaca
__label__0 this highly contentious law began to be phased in over time starting in october of
__label__0 individuals can not  however  take the few thousand dollars that they save in any given year  write a letter to general motors or some other firm  and negotiate to invest their money with that firm
__label__1 financial capital markets bridge this gap  that is  they find ways to take the inflow of funds from many separate suppliers of financial capital and transform it into the funds desired by demanders of financial capital
__label__0 such financial markets include stocks  bonds  bank loans  and other financial investments
__label__0 they also provide advice on potential products  customers  and key employees
__label__1 typically  a venture capital fund invests in a number of firms  and then investors in that fund receive returns according to how the fund as a whole performs  the amount of money invested in venture capital fluctuates substantially from year to year  as one example  venture capital firms invested more than   billion in   according to the national venture capital association
__label__0 all early  stage investors realize that the majority of small startup businesses will never hit it big  indeed  many of them will go out of business within a few months or years
__label__1 a corporate bond is issued by firms  but bonds are also issued by various levels of government
__label__1 for example  a municipal bond is issued by cities  a state bond by us states  and a treasury bond by the federal government through the us department of the treasury
__label__0 those who buy the stock become the owners  or shareholders  of the firm
__label__1 stock represents ownership of a firm  that is  a person who owns   of a company s stock  by definition  owns the entire company
__label__0 first  a firm receives money from the sale of its stock only when the company sells its own stock to the public  the public includes individuals  mutual funds  insurance companies  and pension funds
__label__1 a firm s first sale of stock to the public is called an initial public offering  ipo
__label__0 the ipo is important for two reasons
__label__1 a private company is owned by the people who run it on a day  to  day basis
__label__1 a private company can be run by individuals  in which case it is called a sole proprietorship  or it can be run by a group  in which case it is a partnership
__label__1 accurate information is sometimes not available because corporate governance  the name economists give to the institutions that are supposed to watch over top executives  fails  as the following clear it up feature on lehman brothers shows  how did lack of corporate governance lead to the lehman brothers failure
__label__0 it is usually the average return over a period of time  usually in years or even decades
__label__1 risk measures the uncertainty of that project s profitability
__label__0 there are several types of risk  including default risk and interest rate risk
__label__0 banks offer a range of accounts to serve different needs
__label__1 a checking account typically pays little or no interest  but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money  either by writing a check or by using a debit card  that is  a card which works like a credit card  except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company
__label__1 a checking account typically pays little or no interest  but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money  either by writing a check or by using a debit card  that is  a card which works like a credit card  except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company
__label__1 a savings account typically pays some interest rate  but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine  or you can access the funds electronically
__label__0 in part  this safety arises because a bank account offers more security than keeping a few thousand dollars in the toe of a sock in your underwear drawer
__label__1 in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation  fdic  protects the savings of the average person
__label__0 every bank is required by law to pay a fee to the fdic  based on the size of its deposits
__label__0 this is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor at maturity
__label__0 the bond has a coupon rate or interest rate  which is usually semi  annual  but can be paid at different times throughout the year
__label__0 bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that were clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest
__label__1 the bond yield measures the rate of return a bond is expected to pay over time
__label__0 bonds are bought not only when they are issued  they are also bought and sold during their lifetimes
__label__0 an individual firm may find itself buffeted by unfavorable supply and demand conditions or hurt by unlucky or unwise managerial decisions
__label__1 thus  a standard recommendation from financial investors is diversification  which means buying stocks or bonds from a wide range of companies
__label__0 a saver who diversifies is following the old proverb   do nt put all your eggs in one basket   in any broad group of companies  some firms will do better than expected and some will do worse  but the extremes have a tendency to cancel out extreme increases and decreases in value
__label__0 about two  thirds of us households own their own home
__label__0 an owner s equity in a house is the monetary value the owner would have after selling the house and repaying any outstanding bank loans used to buy the house
__label__0 for example  imagine that you buy a house for    paying   of the price as a down payment and taking out a bank loan for the remaining
__label__1 compound interest is an interest rate calculation on the principal plus the accumulated interest
__label__0 in   congress passed and president george w bush signed into law the bipartisan campaign reform act  bcra
__label__0 the relatively noncontroversial portions of the act strengthen the rules requiring full and speedy disclosure of who contributes money to campaigns
__label__1 the relatively noncontroversial portions of the act strengthen the rules requiring full and speedy disclosure of who contributes money to campaigns
__label__0 as this example suggests  we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in environmental protection and negative externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution  the problem called regulatory capture  which we defined in monopoly and antitrust policy
__label__0 in legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes  or rules for safety in the workplace  or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations  you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma
__label__0 the political pressure to pass a prescription drug benefit for medicare was apparently quite high  while the political pressure to assist the  million with no health insurance at all was considerably lower
__label__0 one reason might be that senior citizens are represented by aarp  a well  funded and well  organized lobbying group  while there is no umbrella organization to lobby for those without health insurance
__label__0 for example  policies that impose price controls  like rent control  may look as if they benefit renters and impose costs only on landlords
__label__0 however  when landlords then decide to reduce the number of rental units available in the area  a number of people who would have liked to rent an apartment end up living somewhere else because no units were available
__label__1 democracy is sometimes summed up  and oversimplified  in two words   majority rule
__label__0 when voters face three or more choices  however  then voting may not always be a useful way of determining what the majority prefers
__label__1 the situation in which choice a is preferred by a majority over choice b  choice b is preferred by a majority over choice c  and choice c is preferred by a majority over choice a is called a voting cycle
__label__0 it is easy to imagine sets of government choices  say  perhaps the choice between increased defense spending  increased government spending on health care  and a tax cut  in which a voting cycle could occur
__label__0 in april   the union representing us tire manufacturing workers filed a request with the us international trade commission  itc   asking it to investigate tire imports from china
__label__0 under us trade law  if imports from a country increase to the point that they cause market disruption in the united states  as determined by the itc  then it can also recommend a remedy for this market disruption
__label__0 who buys all of this production
__label__1 this demand can be divided into four main parts  consumer spending  consumption   business spending  investment   government spending on goods and services  and spending on net exports
__label__0 see the following clear it up feature to understand what is meant by investment
__label__1 the net export component of gdp is equal to the dollar value of exports  x  minus the dollar value of imports  m    x  m
__label__1 the gap between exports and imports is called the trade balance
__label__1 if a country s exports are larger than its imports  then a country is said to have a trade surplus
__label__0 indeed  the trade deficit grew quite large in the late s and in the mid s
__label__0 link   b  also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades  even after the declines during the great recession between  and
__label__0 as noted before  if exports and imports are equal  foreign trade has no effect on total gdp
__label__0 to avoid this problem  which would overstate the size of the economy considerably  government statisticians count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption  investment  government  and trade purposes
__label__1 intermediate goods  which are goods that go into the production of other goods  are excluded from gdp calculations
__label__1 net national product  nnp  is calculated by taking gnp and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out  or reduced in value because of aging  over the course of a year
__label__1 the process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation
__label__0 similarly  if you do not know the rate of inflation  it is difficult to figure out if a rise in gdp is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced
__label__1 the nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time
__label__1 the real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation
__label__0 link  shows the us nominal and real gdp since
__label__0 because  is the base year  the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year
__label__1 a significant decline in real gdp is called a recession
__label__1 an especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression
__label__0 the severe drop in gdp that occurred during the great depression of the s is clearly visible in the figure  as is the great recession of
__label__0 thus  a recession lasts from peak to trough  and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak
__label__1 the movement of the economy from peak to trough and trough to peak is called the business cycle
__label__0 it is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough  to  peak expansions of the twentieth century have happened since
__label__1 exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country a s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country b s currency  for example  japanese yen per british pound   or as the inverse  for example  british pounds per japanese yen
__label__0 two types of exchange rates can be used for this purpose  market exchange rates and purchasing power parity  ppp  equivalent exchange rates
__label__1 market exchange rates vary on a day  to  day basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets
__label__0 one remarkable change in the us economy in recent decades is that  as of   only about   of women participated in the paid labor force
__label__0 by the second decade of the s  nearly   of women participated in the paid labor force according to the bureau of labor statistics
__label__0 as women are now in the labor force  many of the services they used to produce in the non  market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted to some extent into the market economy  which makes the gdp appear larger even if more services are not actually being consumed
__label__0 before the last two centuries  although rulers  nobles  and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the subsistence level  the average person s standard of living had not changed much for centuries
__label__0 progressive  powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
__label__0 according to the dutch economic historian jan luiten van zanden  slavery  based societies  favorable demographics  global trading routes  and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the industrial revolution to succeed
__label__1 the industrial revolution refers to the widespread use of power  driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the s
__label__0 economic growth depends on many factors
__label__0 key among those factors is adherence to the rule of law and protection of property rights and contractual rights by a country s government so that markets can work effectively and efficiently
__label__0 laws must be clear  public  fair  enforced  and equally applicable to all members of society
__label__0 the second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change
__label__1 technological change is a combination of invention  advances in knowledge  and innovation  which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service
__label__0 for example  the transistor was invented in
__label__0 while productivity growth was high in  and   around     it has slowed down since then
__label__0 productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages
__label__0 over time  the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce
__label__0 the category of technology is the  joker in the deck
__label__0 earlier we described it as the combination of invention and innovation
__label__0 when most people think of new technology  the invention of new products like the laser  the smartphone  or some new wonder drug come to mind
__label__1 when society increases the level of capital per person  the result is called capital deepening
__label__0 the idea of capital deepening can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per worker
__label__0 some low  income and middle  income economies around the world have shown a pattern of convergence  in which their economies grow faster than those of high  income countries
__label__0 gdp increased by an average rate of   per year in the s and   per year from  to  in the high  income countries of the world  which include the united states  canada  the countries of the european union  japan  australia  and new zealand
__label__0 how did these incomes increase
__label__1 the neoclassical growth consensus uses the aggregate production function to suggest that the period of modern economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital
__label__0 also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening to create growth and convergence
__label__0 there are some people who have only part time or temporary jobs and who are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as employed  though they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be
__label__0 additionally  there are individuals who are underemployed
__label__0 this includes those that are trained or skilled for one type or level of work who are working in a lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills
__label__0 there does not seem to be a long  term trend toward the rate moving generally higher or generally lower
__label__0 source  federal reserve economic data  fred  httpsresearchstlouisfedorgfredserieslrunttusas
__label__0 one primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the macro economy
__label__0 if firms believe that business is expanding  then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater quantity of labor  and the labor demand curve shifts to the right
__label__0 in other words  these people are involuntarily unemployed
__label__0 what causes involuntary unemployment
__label__0 one argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an implicit contract  which is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is having trouble  and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is strong
__label__0 this wage  setting behavior acts like a form of insurance  the employee has some protection against wage declines in bad times  but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times
__label__1 the insider  outsider model of the labor force  in simple terms  argues that those already working for firms are  insiders   while new employees  at least for a time  are  outsiders
__label__0 a firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization  to be familiar with routine procedures  to train new employees  and so on
__label__1 however  cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm s productivity and prospects  finally  the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline  there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan
__label__0 in a market economy  some companies are always going broke for a variety of reasons  old technology  poor management  good management that happened to make bad decisions  shifts in tastes of consumers so that less of the firm s product is desired  a large customer who went broke  or tough domestic or foreign competitors
__label__0 conversely  other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees
__label__0 however  adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly
__label__0 wages are typically reviewed only once or twice a year
__label__0 in many modern jobs  it is difficult to measure productivity at the individual level
__label__0 sure  the average worker in  is better educated and more productive than the average worker in   but not six times more productive
__label__0 sure  per capita gdp increased substantially from  to   but is the average person in the us economy really more than eight times better off in just  years
__label__0 not likely
__label__0 a modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of supply and demand
__label__0 to simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods  the price level in each period is typically reported as an index number  rather than as the dollar amount for buying the basket of goods
__label__1 price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time
__label__0 the cpi is calculated by government statisticians at the us bureau of labor statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four
__label__0 in recent years  the statisticians have paid considerable attention to a subtle problem  that the change in the total cost of buying a fixed basket of goods and services over time is conceptually not quite the same as the change in the cost of living  because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person to feel that his or her consumption provides an equal level of satisfaction or utility
__label__1 as we ve learned  cpi measures prices as they affect everyday household spending
__label__1 well  a core inflation index is typically calculated by taking the cpi and excluding volatile economic variables
__label__0 in this way  economists have a better sense of the underlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living
__label__1 there is an international price index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported
__label__1 an employment cost index measures wage inflation in the labor market
__label__1 the gdp deflator  measured by the bureau of economic analysis  is a price index that includes all the components of gdp  that is  consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports
__label__0 times of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower  as in the recession of     the great depression  the recession of     and the great recession in
__label__0 there were a few months in  that were deflationary  but not at an annual rate
__label__0 what are the economic problems caused by inflation  and why do economists often regard them with less concern than the general public
__label__0 consider a very short story   the land of funny money
__label__0 the problem of a good  looking nominal interest rate being transformed into an ugly  looking real interest rate can be worsened by taxes
__label__0 the us income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms  without an adjustment for inflation
__label__0 the worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment vehicles
__label__0 these plans are tax deferred  and they are portable so that if the individual takes a job with a different employer  their k  comes with them
__label__0 to the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return  retirees do not suffer from the inflation costs of traditional pensioners  however  ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation
__label__0 inflation can make long  term planning difficult
__label__0 in discussing unintended redistributions  we considered the case of someone trying to plan for retirement with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of inflation
__label__0 similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement  because they must consider what their money will really buy several decades in the future when the rate of future inflation can not be known with certainty
__label__1 an indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation
__label__0 a wide array of indexing arrangements is observed in private markets and government programs
__label__0 since the negative effects of inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not another  say  increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive  indexing will take some of the sting out of inflation
__label__0 the social security program offers two examples of indexing
__label__0 since the passage of the social security indexing act of   the level of social security benefits increases each year along with the consumer price index
__label__1 also  social security is funded by payroll taxes  which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount    in
__label__1 the balance of trade  or trade balance  is any gap between a nation s dollar value of its exports  or what its producers sell abroad  and a nation s dollar worth of imports  or the foreign  made products and services that households and businesses purchase
__label__1 recall from the macroeconomic perspective that if exports exceed imports  the economy is said to have a trade surplus
__label__1 if imports exceed exports  the economy is said to have a trade deficit
__label__1 a few decades ago  it was common to track the solid or physical items that were transported by planes  trains  and trucks between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade
__label__0 this measurement is called the merchandise trade balance
__label__0 in most high  income economies  including the united states  goods make up less than half of a country s total production  while services compose more than half
__label__0 statistics on the balance of trade are compiled by the bureau of economic analysis  bea  within the us department of commerce  using a variety of different sources
__label__1 the final category of the current account balance is unilateral transfers  which are payments made by government  private charities  or individuals in which money is sent abroad without any direct good or service being received
__label__0 economic or military assistance from the us government to other countries fits into this category  as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities
__label__0 the story of robinson and friday also provides a good opportunity to consider the law of comparative advantage  which you learn more about in the international trade chapter
__label__0 the following work it out feature steps you through calculating comparative advantage for the wheat and cloth traded between the united states and great britain in the s
__label__0 calculating comparative advantage
__label__0 the national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance
__label__0 in a nation s financial capital market  the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments
__label__0 when the trade deficit rises  it necessarily means a greater net inflow of foreign financial capital
__label__0 the national saving and investment identity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several different ways
__label__0 a nation s level of trade may at first sound like much the same issue as the balance of trade  but these two are actually quite separate
__label__0 it is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high level of trade  measured by its exports of goods and services as a share of its gdp  while it also has a near  balance between exports and imports
__label__1 a high level of trade indicates that a good portion of the nation s production is exported
__label__0 the next three chapters take up this task
__label__0 this chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand  how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium  and how shifts in aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium
__label__1 this chapter also relates the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy  growth  unemployment  and inflation   and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these goals
__label__1 the bottom line remains  however  that every sale represents income to someone  and so  say s law argues  a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in the economy
__label__1 because jean  baptiste say  adam smith  and other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as  classical  economists  modern economists who generally subscribe to the say s law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy are called neoclassical economists
__label__0 if supply always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level  then  as say himself recognized  it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur
__label__0 to be sure  even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand  the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses
__label__1 the alternative to say s law  with its emphasis on supply  can be named keynes  law   demand creates its own supply
__label__0 as a matter of historical accuracy  just as jean  baptiste say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as say s law  john maynard keynes never wrote down keynes  law  but the law is a useful simplification that conveys a certain point of view
__label__0 when keynes wrote his great work the general theory of employment  interest  and money during the great depression of the s  he pointed out that during the depression  the capacity of the economy to supply goods and services had not changed much
__label__0 warren harding was the first president to regularly give speeches over the radio
__label__0 president herbert hoover used radio as well  mainly to announce government programs on aid and unemployment relief
__label__0 herbert hoover  radio address to the nation on unemployment relief   the american presidency project   october   httpwwwpresidencyucsbedu  wspid
__label__0 yet it was franklin d roosevelt who became famous for harnessing the political power of radio
__label__0 on entering office in march   president roosevelt needed to quiet public fears about the economy and prevent people from removing their money from the banks
__label__0 stations chose their own broadcasting locations  signal strengths  and frequencies  which sometimes overlapped with one another or with the military  leading to tuning problems for listeners
__label__1 the radio act    created the federal radio commission  frc   which made the first effort to set standards  frequencies  and license stations
__label__0 the commission was under heavy pressure from congress  however  and had little authority
__label__0 television was also useful to combat scandals and accusations of impropriety
__label__0 republican vice presidential candidate richard nixon used a televised speech in  to address accusations that he had taken money from a political campaign fund illegally
__label__0 nixon laid out his finances  investments  and debts and ended by saying that the only election gift the family had received was a cocker spaniel the children named checkers
__label__0 lee huebner   the checkers speech after  years   the atlantic   september
__label__0 the  checkers speech  was remembered more for humanizing nixon than for proving he had not taken money from the campaign account

__label__0 without it  the press would not be free to alert citizens to government abuses and corruption
__label__1 in fact  one of new york s first newspapers  the new york weekly journal  began under john peter zenger in  with the goal of routing corruption in the colonial government

__label__0 during the second persian gulf war  fox news reporter geraldo rivera convinced the military to embed him with a us army unit in iraq to provide live coverage of its day  to  day activities
__label__0 during one of the reports he filed while traveling with the st airborne division  rivera had his camera operator record him drawing a map in the sand  showing where his unit was and using baghdad as a reference point
__label__0 the telecommunications act of  brought significant changes to the radio and television industries
__label__1 it dropped the limit on the number of radio stations  forty  and television stations  twelve  a single company could own
__label__1 the practice of granting anonymity to sources is sometimes referred to as reporter s privilege
__label__0 fueled by the first amendment s protection of the press  journalists have long offered to keep sources confidential to protect them from government prosecution
__label__0 concerns about the effects of media on consumers and the existence and extent of media bias go back to the s
__label__0 reporter and commentator walter lippmann noted that citizens have limited personal experience with government and the world and posited that the media  through their stories  place ideas in citizens  minds
__label__0 these ideas become part of the citizens  frame of reference and affect their decisions

__label__0 winner  take  all systems of electing candidates to office  which exist in several countries other than the united states  require that the winner receive either the majority of votes or a plurality of the votes
__label__0 us elections are based on plurality voting
__label__1 plurality voting  commonly referred to as first  past  the  post  is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins  whether or not he or she gains a majority   percent or greater  of the total votes cast
__label__0 the argument for this method is that it is ultimately the party and not the individual who will influence policy
__label__1 under this model of proportional representation  legislative seats are allocated to competing parties based on the total share of votes they receive in the election
__label__0 as a result  any given election can have multiple winners  and voters who might prefer a smaller party over a major one have a chance to be represented in government   link
__label__0 besides the existence of the electoral college  political scientist gary w cox has also suggested that the relative prosperity of the united states and the relative unity of its citizens have prevented the formation of  large dissenting groups  that might give support to third parties

__label__0 one of the best  known party realignments occurred when democrats moved to include african americans and other minorities into their national coalition during the great depression
__label__0 after the civil war  republicans  the party of lincoln  were viewed as the party that had freed the slaves
__label__0 their efforts to provide blacks with greater legal rights earned them the support of african americans in both the south  where they were newly enfranchised  and the northeast
__label__0 since winning elections is the first goal of the political party  it makes sense that the formal party organization mirrors the local  state  federal structure of the us political system
__label__0 while the lowest level of party organization is technically the precinct  many of the operational responsibilities for local elections fall upon the county  level organization
__label__0 the county  level organization is in many ways the workhorse of the party system  especially around election time
__label__0 in   for example  only one  third of the eligible voters in new hampshire voted in the state s primary  one of the earliest and thus most important in the nation  however   percent of eligible voters in the state voted in the general election in november

__label__0 people may see or read an occasional story about the meetings of the state committees or convention but pay little attention
__label__0 but the national conventions  organized and sponsored by the national  level party  can dominate the national discussion for several weeks in late summer  a time when the major media outlets are often searching for news
__label__1 these conventions are the definition of a media circus at which high  ranking politicians  party elites  and sometimes celebrities  such as actor  director clint eastwood   link    along with individuals many consider to be the future leaders of the party are brought before the public so the party can make its best case for being the one to direct the future of the country

__label__0 national party conventions culminate in the formal nomination of the party nominees for the offices of president and vice president  and they mark the official beginning of the presidential competition between the two parties
__label__0 leaders serve as party managers and are the highest  ranking members of the party in each chamber of congress
__label__1 the party whip ensures that members are present when a piece of legislation is to be voted on and directs them how to vote
__label__0 the whip is the second  highest ranking member of the party in each chamber
__label__1 the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader  the majority party s congressional leaders  have significant tools at their disposal to punish party members who defect on a particular vote
__label__0 finally  a member of the minority party must occasionally work with the opposition on some issues in order to accomplish any of his or her constituency s goals
__label__0 this is especially the case in the senate  which is a super  majority institution
__label__0 the past thirty years have brought a dramatic change in the relationship between the two parties as fewer conservative democrats and liberal republicans have been elected to office
__label__1 as political moderates  or individuals with ideologies in the middle of the ideological spectrum  leave the political parties at all levels  the parties have grown farther apart ideologically  a result called party polarization
__label__0 in other words  at least organizationally and in government  republicans and democrats have become increasingly dissimilar from one another   link
__label__0 perhaps the clearest sign of congress  ineffectiveness is that the threat of government shutdown has become a constant
__label__0 shutdowns occur when congress and the president are unable to authorize and appropriate funds before the current budget runs out
__label__1 a final possible cause for polarization is the increasing sophistication of gerrymandering  or the manipulation of legislative districts in an attempt to favor a particular candidate   link
__label__0 according to the gerrymandering thesis  the more moderate or heterogeneous a voting district  the more moderate the politician s behavior once in office
__label__0 legislators asked the courts to overturn the popular referendum and end the operation of the redistricting commission

__label__0 arizona state legislature v arizona independent redistricting commission   s ct
__label__1 but whereas interest groups often work indirectly to influence our leaders  political parties are organizations that try to directly influence public policy through its members who seek to win and hold public office
__label__0 parties accomplish this by identifying and aligning sets of issues that are important to voters in the hopes of gaining support during elections  their positions on these critical issues are often presented in documents known as a party platform   link    which is adopted at each party s presidential nominating convention every four years
__label__0 if successful  a party can create a large enough electoral coalition to gain control of the government
__label__0 two loosely affiliated party coalitions  known as the federalists and the democratic  republicans  soon emerged
__label__0 the federalists succeeded in electing their first leader  john adams  to the presidency in   only to see the democratic  republicans gain victory under thomas jefferson four years later in
__label__1 this marked the beginning of what historians call the second party system  the first parties had been the federalists and the jeffersonian republicans   with the splitting of the democratic  republicans and the formation of two new political parties
__label__0 one half  called simply the democratic party  was the party of jackson  it continued to advocate for the common people by championing westward expansion and opposing a national bank
__label__0 henry a wallace  a vice president under franklin roosevelt  formed a new progressive party  which had little in common with the earlier progressive party
__label__0 wallace favored racial desegregation and believed that the united states should have closer ties to the soviet union

__label__1 given its potential impact  interest group representatives  lobbyists  from the insurance industry  hospitals  medical device manufacturers  and organizations representing doctors  patients  and employers all tried to influence what the law would look like and the way it would operate
__label__0 as you might expect  the interest hires a lobbyist  employs one internally  or has a member volunteer to lobby on its behalf
__label__0 for present purposes  we might restrict our definition to the relatively broad one in the lobbying disclosure act
__label__0 anthony j nownes
__label__0 verizon and coca  cola will register to lobby in order to influence policy in a way that benefits them
__label__1 these corporations will either have one or more in  house lobbyists  who work for one interest group or firm and represent their organization in a lobbying capacity  andor will hire a contract lobbyist  individuals who work for firms that represent a multitude of clients and are often hired because of their resources and their ability to contact and lobby lawmakers  to represent them before the legislature
__label__0 interest groups and organizations represent both private and public interests in the united states
__label__1 private interests usually seek particularized benefits from government that favor either a single interest or a narrow set of interests
__label__0 for example  corporations and political institutions may lobby government for tax exemptions  fewer regulations  or favorable laws that benefit individual companies or an industry more generally

__label__0 in his classic work  the logic of collective action  economist mancur olson discussed the conditions under which collective actions problems would exist  and he noted that they were prevalent among organized interests

__label__0 tea party protests  for instance  gave individuals all over the country the opportunity to voice their opposition to government actions and control
__label__0 likewise  the occupy wall street movement also gave a voice to those individuals frustrated with economic inequality and the influence of large corporations on the public sector
__label__0 individually  the protestors would likely have received little notice  but by joining with others  they drew substantial attention in the media and from lawmakers   link
__label__0 interest groups can amplify the voices of such individuals through proper organization and allow them to participate in ways that would be less effective or even impossible alone or in small numbers
__label__0 the tea party is an example of a so  called astroturf movement  because it is not  strictly speaking  a grassroots movement
__label__0 many trace the party s origins to groups that champion the interests of the wealthy such as americans for prosperity and citizens for a sound economy
__label__0 the poor may also have low levels of efficacy  which refers to the conviction that you can make a difference or that government cares about you and your views
__label__0 people with low levels of efficacy are less likely to participate in politics  including voting and joining interest groups

__label__0 we saw above that pluralists even argued that assembling in groups is natural and that people will gravitate toward others with similar views
__label__1 in buckley v valeo     the supreme court upheld congress s right to regulate elections by restricting contributions to campaigns and candidates
__label__0 however  at the same time  it overturned restrictions on expenditures by candidates and their families  as well as total expenditures by campaigns
__label__0 buckley v valeo       us
__label__1 in   an exemption was granted to get  out  the vote and grassroots voter registration drives  creating what has become known as the soft  money loophole  soft money was a way in which interests could spend money on behalf of candidates without being restricted by federal law
__label__0 to close this loophole  senators john mccain and russell feingold sponsored the bipartisan campaign reform act in  to ban parties from collecting and distributing unregulated money
__label__0 the citizens united v federal election commission
__label__0 citizens united v federal election commission       us      and the mccutcheon v federal election commission mccutcheon v federal election commission       us
__label__0 cases opened the door for a substantially greater flow of money into elections
__label__0 citizens united overturned the soft money ban of the bipartisan campaign reform act and allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections
__label__0 essentially  the supreme court argued in a    decision that these entities had free speech rights  much like individuals  and that free speech included campaign spending
__label__1 according to the honest leadership and open government act  lobbyists must certify that they have not violated the law regarding gift giving  and the penalty for knowingly violating the law increased from a fine of   to one of
__label__1 also  revolving door laws also prevent lawmakers from lobbying government immediately after leaving public office
__label__0 members of the house of representatives can not register to lobby for a year after they leave office  while senators have a two  year  cooling off  period before they can officially lobby
__label__0 the meeting these delegates convened became known as the constitutional convention of
__label__0 although its prescribed purpose was to revise the articles of confederation  a number of delegates charted a path toward disposing of the articles entirely
__label__0 in the final draft of the us constitution  the bicameral congress established by the convention of  was given a number of powers and limitations
__label__0 these are outlined in article i  appendix b
__label__1 this article describes the minimum age of congresspersons  section    requires that congress meet at least once a year  section    guarantees members  pay  section    and gives congress the power to levy taxes  borrow money  and regulate commerce  section
__label__1 two remaining problems in the house are the size of each representative s constituency  the body of voters who elect him or her  and the challenge of washington  dc
__label__0 first  the average number of citizens in a congressional district now tops
__label__0 in general  congressional powers can be divided into three types  enumerated  implied  and inherent
__label__1 an enumerated power is a power explicitly stated in the constitution
__label__1 an implied power is one not specifically detailed in the constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government
__label__0 article i  section   of the us constitution details the enumerated powers of the legislature
__label__0 these include the power to levy and collect taxes  declare war  raise an army and navy  coin money  borrow money  regulate commerce among the states and with foreign nations  establish federal courts and bankruptcy rules  establish rules for immigration and naturalization  and issue patents and copyrights
__label__0 but in united states v lopez  a decision issued in   the court changed course again and  for the first time in half a century  struck down a law as an unconstitutional overstepping of the commerce clause
__label__0 united states v lopez   us
__label__0 five years later  the court did it again  convincing many that the country may be witnessing the beginning of a rollback in congress s power to regulate in the states
__label__0 when the patient protection and affordable care act  also known as the aca  or obamacare  came before the supreme court in   many believed the court would strike it down
__label__0 instead  the justices took the novel approach of upholding the law based on the congress s enumerated power to tax  rather than the commerce clause
__label__0 the us constitution is very clear about who can be elected as a member of the house or senate
__label__0 a house member must be a us citizen of at least seven years  standing and at least twenty  five years old
__label__0 until   it also limited advertisements run by unions and corporations thirty days before a primary and sixty days before a general election
__label__0 bipartisan campaign reform act of    httpwwwfecgovpagesbcrabcraupdateshtml  may      greg scott and gary mullen   thirty year report   september   httpwwwfecgovinfopublicationsyearpdf  may
__label__0 the fec s enforcement of the law spurred numerous court cases challenging it
__label__0 the most controversial decision was handed down by the supreme court in   whose ruling on citizens united v federal election commission led to the removal of spending limits on corporations
__label__0 justices in the majority argued that the bcra violated a corporation s free  speech rights
__label__0 citizens united v federal election commission   us
__label__0 the amount of money they raise against their challengers demonstrates their advantage
__label__0 in   for example  the average senate incumbent raised    whereas the average challenger raised only
__label__0 incumbent advantage   httpwwwopensecretsorgoverviewincumbsphpcycle  may
__label__0 this is one of the many reasons incumbents win a large majority of congressional races each electoral cycle
__label__0 incumbents attract more money because people want to give to a winner
__label__0 the speaker also rules on house procedures  often delegating authority for certain duties to other members
__label__0 he or she appoints members and chairs to committees  creates select committees to fulfill a specific purpose and then disband  and can even select a member to be speaker pro tempore  who acts as speaker in the speaker s absence
__label__0 finally  when the senate joins the house in a joint session  the speaker presides over these sessions  because they are usually held in the house of representatives
__label__0 below these leaders are the two party s respective whips
__label__0 a whip s job  as the name suggests  is to whip up votes and otherwise enforce party discipline
__label__0 this committee is the first call for proposed bills  fewer than  percent of which are reported out of committee to the floor
__label__0 the second type is the joint committee
__label__1 joint committee members are appointed from both the house and the senate  and are charged with exploring a few key issues  such as the economy and taxation
__label__0 technically  bills that raise revenue  like tax bills  must begin in the house
__label__0 this exception is encoded within the constitution in article i  section   which states   all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives  but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills
__label__0 yet  despite the seemingly clear language of the constitution  congress has found ways to get around this rule
__label__0 this flexibility about speaking in the senate gave rise to a unique tactic  the filibuster
__label__0 the word  filibuster  comes from the dutch word vrijbuiter  which means pirate
__label__0 this was difficult to do  but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the senate floor  with the salient exception of senator strom thurmond s record twenty  four  hour filibuster of the civil rights act
__label__0 in   after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era  the senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two  thirds to three  fifths  or sixty votes  where it remains today  except for judicial nominations for which only fifty  five votes are needed to invoke cloture
__label__0 moreover  filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act  the reconciliation act of  was the act under which the implementing legislation for obamacare was passed
__label__0 according to political scientist barbara sinclair  the primary trigger for the shift away from the classic legislative route was the budget reforms of the s
__label__0 the  budget and impoundment control act gave congress a mechanism for making large  all  encompassing  budget decisions
__label__0 in the years that followed  the budget process gradually became the vehicle for creating comprehensive policy changes
__label__0 new york  routledge
__label__0 as a result of a  supreme court decision  citizens united v federal election commission  there is no limit to how much money unions or corporations can donate to super pacs
__label__0 unlike pacs  however  super pacs can not contribute money directly to individual candidates
__label__0 these documents present legal arguments stating why a given court should take a case andor why a court should rule a certain way
__label__1 in obergefell v hodges     the supreme court case that legalized same  sex marriage nationwide  numerous interest groups filed amicus briefs
__label__0 obergefell v hodges   us
__label__0 for example  the human rights campaign  shown demonstrating in  link   filed a brief arguing that the fourteenth amendment s due process and equal protection clauses required that same  sex couples be afforded the same rights to marry as opposite  sex couples
__label__0 in a    decision  the us supreme court agreed
__label__1 in contrast  a representative who understands their role to be that of a trustee believes he or she is entrusted by the constituents with the power to use good judgment to make decisions on the constituents  behalf
__label__0 in the words of the eighteenth  century british philosopher edmund burke  who championed the trustee model of representation   parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests

__label__0 african americans were routinely deprived of the opportunity to participate in democracy  and hispanics and other minority groups were fairly insignificant in number and excluded by the states
__label__0 while women in many western states could vote sooner  all women were not able to exercise their right to vote nationwide until passage of the nineteenth amendment in   and they began to make up more than  percent of either chamber only in the s
__label__0 in the wake of the civil rights movement  african american representatives also began to enter congress in increasing numbers
__label__0 in   to better represent their interests  these representatives founded the congressional black caucus  cbc   an organization that grew out of a democratic select committee formed in

__label__0 in   according to gallup polling  the rise in approval accompanied a similar rise in other mood measures  including president bill clinton s approval ratings and general satisfaction with the state of the country and the economy

__label__0 early deliberations produced agreement that the executive would be a single person  elected for a single term of seven years by the legislature  empowered to veto legislation  and subject to impeachment and removal by the legislature
__label__0 new jersey s william paterson offered an alternate model as part of his proposal  typically referred to as the small  state or new jersey plan
__label__0 this plan called for merely amending the articles of confederation to allow for an executive branch made up of a committee elected by a unicameral congress for a single term
__label__0 
__label__0 in addition to describing the process of election for the presidency and vice presidency  the delegates to the constitutional convention also outlined who was eligible for election and how congress might remove the president
__label__1 article ii of the constitution lays out the agreed  upon requirements  the chief executive must be at least thirty  five years old and a  natural born  citizen of the united states  or a citizen at the time of the constitution s adoption  who has been an inhabitant of the united states for at least fourteen years
__label__0 us constitution  article ii  section
__label__1 while article ii also states that the term of office is four years and does not expressly limit the number of times a person might be elected president  after franklin d roosevelt was elected four times  from  to    the twenty  second amendment was proposed and ratified  limiting the presidency to two four  year terms
__label__0 three presidents have faced impeachment proceedings in the house  none has been both impeached by the house and removed by the senate
__label__0 in the wake of the civil war  president andrew johnson faced congressional contempt for decisions made during reconstruction
__label__0 president richard nixon faced an overwhelming likelihood of impeachment in the house for his cover  up of key information relating to the  break  in at the democratic party s campaign headquarters at the watergate hotel and apartment complex
__label__0 no sooner had the presidency been established than the occupants of the office  starting with george washington  began acting in ways that expanded both its formal and informal powers
__label__0 for example  washington established a cabinet or group of advisors to help him administer his duties  consisting of the most senior appointed officers of the executive branch
__label__0 some waged undeclared wars  as john adams did against the french in the quasi  war
__label__0 others agreed to negotiate for significant territorial gains  as thomas jefferson did when he oversaw the purchase of louisiana from france
__label__0 concerned that he might be violating the powers of the office  jefferson rationalized that his not facing impeachment charges constituted congress s tacit approval of his actions
__label__0 later dubbed the monroe doctrine  this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of american power in the twentieth century
__label__0 andrew jackson employed the veto as a measure of policy to block legislative initiatives with which he did not agree and acted unilaterally when it came to depositing federal funds in several local banks around the country instead of in the bank of the united states
__label__0 this move changed the way vetoes would be used in the future
__label__0 abraham lincoln  a member of congress at the time  was critical of polk s actions
__label__0 later  however  as president himself  lincoln used presidential war powers and the concepts of military necessity and national security to undermine the confederate effort to seek independence for the southern states
__label__1 he also famously used a unilateral proclamation to issue the emancipation proclamation  which cited the military necessity of declaring millions of slaves in confederate  controlled territory to be free
__label__0 his successor  andrew johnson  became so embroiled with radical republicans about ways to implement reconstruction policies and programs after the civil war that the house of representatives impeached him  although the legislators in the senate were unable to successfully remove him from office

__label__0 the law   executive privilege  definition and standards of application   presidential studies quarterly   no
__label__0 the more general defense of its use by white house officials and attorneys ensures that the president can secure candid advice from his or her advisors and staff members
__label__0 increasingly over time  presidents have made more use of their unilateral powers  including executive orders  rules that bypass congress but still have the force of law if the courts do not overturn them
__label__0 more recently  presidents have offered their own interpretation of legislation as they sign it via signing statements  discussed later in this chapter  directed to the bureaucratic entity charged with implementation
__label__0 however  president woodrow wilson  owing to a provision tacked onto the bill regarding presidential appointments  vetoed the legislation that would have transformed the budgeting process in this way
__label__0 his successor  warren harding  felt differently and signed the budget and accounting act of
__label__1 the act gave the president first  mover advantage in the budget process via the first  executive budget
__label__1 it also created the first  ever budget staff at the disposal of a president  at the time called the bureau of the budget but decades later renamed the office of management and budget   link
__label__0 in somewhat of a countervailing trend in the general election stage of the process  by the presidential election of   many states were using popular elections to choose their electors
__label__0 this became important in that election when andrew jackson won the popular vote and the largest number of electors  but the presidency was given to john quincy adams instead
__label__0 out of the frustration of jackson s supporters emerged a powerful two  party system that took control of the selection process  daniel myron greene
__label__0 the  elections seem to support the idea that the primary process produces a nominee rather than party insiders
__label__0 outsiders donald trump on the republican side and senator bernie sanders on the democratic side had much success despite significant concerns about them from party elites
__label__0 whether this pattern could be reversed in the case of a closely contested selection process remains to be seen
__label__1 the twelfth amendment  ratified in   provided for the separate election of president and vice president as well as setting out ways to choose a winner if no one received a majority of the electoral votes
__label__0 only once since the passage of the twelfth amendment  during the election of   has the house selected the president under these rules  and only once  in   has the senate chosen the vice president
__label__0 nor has public funding helped to solve the problem
__label__0 indeed  starting with barack obama s  decision to forfeit public funding so as to skirt the spending limitations imposed  candidates now regularly opt to raise more money rather than to take public funding

__label__1 in addition  political action committees  pacs   supposedly focused on issues rather than specific candidates  seek to influence the outcome of the race by supporting or opposing a candidate according to the pac s own interests
__label__0 these include the heads of the internal revenue service  the central intelligence agency  the office of management and budget  the federal reserve  the social security administration  the environmental protection agency  the national labor relations board  and the equal employment opportunity commission

__label__0 despite the fact that one  third of us presidents have appointed a supreme court justice in an election year  when associate justice antonin scalia died unexpectedly in early   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell declared that the senate would not hold hearings on a nominee until after the upcoming presidential election
__label__0 barbara perry   one  third of all us presidents appointed a supreme court justice in an election year   washington post   february   httpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewsmonkeycagewponethirdofalluspresidentsappointedasupremecourtjusticeinanelectionyear
__label__0 mcconnell remained adamant even after president barack obama  saying he was acting in fulfillment of his constitutional duty  nominated merrick garland  longtime chief judge of the federal circuit court of appeals for the dc circuit
__label__0 garland is highly respected by senators from both parties and won confirmation to his dc circuit position by a    vote in the senate
__label__0 when supreme court justice antonin scalia died unexpectedly in early   many in washington braced for a political sandstorm of obstruction and accusations
__label__0 such was the record of supreme court nominations during the obama administration and  indeed  for the last few decades
__label__0 nor is this phenomenon restricted to nominations for the highest court in the land
__label__0 indeed  until the twentieth century  many presidents had little to do with the naming of their running mate at the nominating convention
__label__0 the office was seen as a form of political exile  and that motivated republicans to name theodore roosevelt as william mckinley s running mate in
__label__0 the strategy was to get the ambitious politician out of the way while still taking advantage of his popularity
__label__0 but in the s  starting with jimmy carter  presidents made a far more conscious effort to make their vice presidents part of the governing team  placing them in charge of increasingly important issues
__label__0 sometimes  as in the case of bill clinton and al gore  the partnership appeared to be smooth if not always harmonious
__label__0 in the case of george w bush and his very experienced vice president dick cheney  observers speculated whether the vice president might have exercised too much influence
__label__0 the first act undertaken by the new president  the delivery of an inaugural address  can do much to set the tone for what is intended to follow
__label__1 while such an address may be an exercise in rhetorical inspiration  it also allows the president to set forth priorities within the overarching vision of what he or she intends to do
__label__1 the concept of going public involves the president delivering a major television address in the hope that americans watching the address will be compelled to contact their house and senate member and that such public pressure will result in the legislators supporting the president on a major piece of legislation
__label__1 through the work of scientists in the late th century  the main features of the electrostatic force  the existence of two types of charge  the observation that like charges repel  unlike charges attract  and the decrease of force with distance  were eventually refined  and expressed as a mathematical formula
__label__1 the mathematical formula for the electrostatic force is called coulomb s law after the french physicist charles coulomb       who performed experiments and first proposed a formula to calculate it
__label__0 for example  a charged rubber comb attracts neutral bits of paper from a distance via the coulomb force
__label__0 it is very useful to think of an object being surrounded in space by a force field
__label__0 the force field carries the force to another object  called a test object  some distance away

__label__0 once those fields are found  the total field can be determined using vector addition  solution
__label__0 its  electrons   from the oxygen atom and  from the two hydrogen atoms  tend to remain closer to the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nuclei
__label__1 this creates two centers of equal and opposite charges  what is called a dipole  as illustrated in  link
__label__1 the magnitude of the dipole is called the dipole moment  these two centers of charge will terminate some of the electric field lines coming from a free charge  as on a dna molecule
__label__1 conductors contain free charges that move easily
__label__1 when excess charge is placed on a conductor or the conductor is put into a static electric field  charges in the conductor quickly respond to reach a steady state called electrostatic equilibrium
__label__0 another device that makes use of some of these principles is a faraday cage
__label__1 this is a metal shield that encloses a volume
__label__0 the study of electrostatics has proven useful in many areas
__label__0 this module covers just a few of the many applications of electrostatics
__label__0 the heart of the process is shown in simplified form in  link
__label__0 a selenium  coated aluminum drum is sprayed with positive charge from points on a device called a corotron
__label__0 selenium is a substance with an interesting property  it is a photoconductor
__label__1 that is  selenium is an insulator when in the dark and a conductor when exposed to light
__label__1 the ink jet printer  commonly used to print computer  generated text and graphics  also employs electrostatics
__label__0 a nozzle makes a fine spray of tiny ink droplets  which are then given an electrostatic charge
__label__0 this implies that a conductor is an equipotential surface in static situations
__label__0 there can be no voltage difference across the surface of a conductor  or charges will flow
__label__1 one of the uses of this fact is that a conductor can be fixed at zero volts by connecting it to the earth with a good conductor  a process called grounding
__label__0 grounding can be a useful safety tool
__label__0 recall that e  v  de  v  d size   e  v  d    for a parallel plate capacitor
__label__0 also shown in  link  are maximum electric field strengths in v  m  called dielectric strengths  for several materials
__label__0 these are the fields above which the material begins to break down and conduct
__label__0 ohm s law  like hooke s law  is not universally valid
__label__0 the many substances for which ohm s law holds are called ohmic
__label__0 these include good conductors like copper and aluminum  and some poor conductors under certain circumstances
__label__0 most well  known applications  however  use a time  varying voltage source
__label__1 alternating current  ac  is the flow of electric charge that periodically reverses direction
__label__0 if the source varies periodically  particularly sinusoidally  the circuit is known as an alternating current circuit
__label__1 a thermal hazard is one where excessive electric power causes undesired thermal effects  such as starting a fire in the wall of a house
__label__1 a shock hazard occurs when electric current passes through a person
__label__1 shocks range in severity from painful  but otherwise harmless  to heart  stopping lethality
__label__0 the sheer number of nerve cells and the incredibly greater number of connections between them makes this system the subtle wonder that it is
__label__1 nerve conduction is a general term for electrical signals carried by nerve cells
__label__1 it is one aspect of bioelectricity  or electrical effects in and created by biological systems
__label__1 an electrocardiogram  ecg  is a record of the voltages created by the wave of depolarization and subsequent repolarization in the heart
__label__0 voltages between pairs of electrodes placed on the chest are vector components of the voltage wave on the heart
__label__0 when are resistors in series
__label__1 resistors are in series whenever the flow of charge  called the current  must flow through devices sequentially
__label__1 resistors are in series whenever the flow of charge  called the current  must flow through devices sequentially
__label__0 the reason for the decrease in output voltage for depleted or overloaded batteries is that all voltage sources have two fundamental parts  a source of electrical energy and an internal resistance
__label__0 let us examine both
__label__1 kirchhoff s second rule  the loop rule  is an application of conservation of energy
__label__0 the loop rule is stated in terms of potential  vv size   v     rather than potential energy  but the two are related since pe elec  q vpe elec  qv size   ital
__label__1 a potentiometer is a null measurement device for measuring potentials  voltages
__label__0 see  link
__label__0 if freely suspended  one pole will point toward the north
__label__0 the two poles are thus named the north magnetic pole and the south magnetic pole  or more properly  north  seeking and south  seeking poles  for the attractions in those directions
__label__0 what happens on a microscopic scale is illustrated in  link
__label__0 the regions within the material called domains act like small bar magnets
__label__0 within domains  the poles of individual atoms are aligned
__label__1 electromagnetism is the use of electric current to make magnets
__label__1 these temporarily induced magnets are called electromagnets
__label__0 electromagnets are employed for everything from a wrecking yard crane that lifts scrapped cars to controlling the beam of a km  circumference particle accelerator to the magnets in medical imaging machines  see  link
__label__0 instrument for magnetic resonance imaging  mri
__label__0 this separation of charge creates a voltage  size        known as the hall emf  across the conductor
__label__1 the creation of a voltage across a current  carrying conductor by a magnetic field is known as the hall effect  after edwin hall  the american physicist who discovered it in
__label__0 the hall effect
__label__0 a  electrons move to the left in this flat conductor  conventional current to the right
__label__0 the field around a long straight wire is found to be in circular loops
__label__0 the right hand rule   rhr  emerges from this exploration and is valid for any current segment  point the thumb in the direction of the current  and the fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field loops created by it
__label__0 a  compasses placed near a long straight current  carrying wire indicate that field lines form circular loops centered on the wire
__label__1 b  right hand rule  states that  if the right hand thumb points in the direction of the current  the fingers curl in the direction of the field
__label__1 integral calculus is needed to sum the field for an arbitrary shape current
__label__1 this results in a more complete law  called ampere s law  which relates magnetic field and current in a general way
__label__1 ampere s law in turn is a part of maxwell s equations  which give a complete theory of all electromagnetic phenomena
__label__1 a solenoid is a long coil of wire  with many turns or loops  as opposed to a flat loop
__label__0 because of its shape  the field inside a solenoid can be very uniform  and also very strong
__label__0 it non  invasively produces two  dimensional and three  dimensional images of the body that provide important medical information with none of the hazards of x  rays
__label__1 mri is based on an effect called nuclear magnetic resonance  nmr  in which an externally applied magnetic field interacts with the nuclei of certain atoms  particularly those of hydrogen  protons
__label__0 these nuclei possess their own small magnetic fields  similar to those of electrons and the current loops discussed earlier in this chapter
__label__0 when placed in an external magnetic field  such nuclei experience a torque that pushes or aligns the nuclei into one of two new energy states  depending on the orientation of its spin  analogous to the n pole and s pole in a bar magnet
__label__0 this relationship is known as faraday s law of induction
__label__0 the units for emf are volts  as is usual
__label__1 as discussed in motional emf  motional emf is induced when a conductor moves in a magnetic field or when a magnetic field moves relative to a conductor
__label__1 if motional emf can cause a current loop in the conductor  we refer to that current as an eddy current
__label__0 eddy currents can produce significant drag  called magnetic damping  on the motion involved
__label__0 is the maximum  peak  emf
__label__0 note that the frequency of the oscillation is f      f      size   f          and the period is t    f      t    f      size   t    f
__label__0 link  shows a graph of emf as a function of time  and it now seems reasonable that ac voltage is sinusoidal
__label__1 this is known as the transformer equation  and it simply states that the ratio of the secondary to primary voltages in a transformer equals the ratio of the number of loops in their coils
__label__1 a thermal hazard occurs when there is electrical overheating
__label__1 a shock hazard occurs when electric current passes through a person
__label__0 both hazards have already been discussed
__label__0 the beauty of a coral reef  the warm radiance of sunshine  the sting of sunburn  the x  ray revealing a broken bone  even microwave popcorn  all are brought to us by electromagnetic waves
__label__0 the list of the various types of electromagnetic waves  ranging from radio transmission waves to nuclear gamma  ray   size g    ray  emissions  is interesting in itself
__label__1 electric field lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative charges
__label__1 the electric field is defined as the force per unit charge on a test charge  and the strength of the force is related to the electric constant  size    rsub  size          also known as the permittivity of free space
__label__0 as the process continues  the charge separation reverses and the field reaches its maximum downward value  returns to zero  and rises to its maximum upward value at the end of one complete cycle
__label__0 the outgoing wave has an amplitude proportional to the maximum separation of charge
__label__0 its wavelength   size   left   right     is proportional to the period of the oscillation and  hence  is smaller for short periods or high frequencies
__label__0 the dimensions of the antenna are critical for determining the frequency of the radiated electromagnetic waves
__label__0 this is a resonant phenomenon and when we tune radios or tv  we vary electrical properties to achieve appropriate resonant conditions in the antenna
__label__1 am radio waves are used to carry commercial radio signals in the frequency range from  to  khz
__label__1 the abbreviation am stands for amplitude modulation  which is the method for placing information on these waves
__label__0 see  link
__label__0 television is also broadcast on electromagnetic waves
__label__0 since the waves must carry a great deal of visual as well as audio information  each channel requires a larger range of frequencies than simple radio transmission
__label__1 microwaves are the highest  frequency electromagnetic waves that can be produced by currents in macroscopic circuits and devices
__label__0 microwave frequencies range from about  hz  hz size
__label__0 the microwave and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum overlap  see  link
__label__1 infrared radiation is generally produced by thermal motion and the vibration and rotation of atoms and molecules
__label__0 electronic transitions in atoms and molecules can also produce infrared radiation
__label__0 this is true whenever the reflecting surfaces are perpendicular  and it is independent of the angle of incidence
__label__1 such an object  shown in  link   is called a corner reflector  since the light bounces from its inside corner
__label__0 many inexpensive reflector buttons on bicycles  cars  and warning signs have corner reflectors designed to return light in the direction from which it originated
__label__0 due to the lens s shape  light is thus bent toward the axis at both surfaces
__label__1 the point at which the rays cross is defined to be the focal point f of the lens
__label__1 the distance from the center of the lens to its focal point is defined to be the focal lengthff size   f    of the lens
__label__0 while ray tracing for complicated lenses  such as those found in sophisticated cameras  may require computer techniques  there is a set of simple rules for tracing rays through thin lenses
__label__1 a thin lens is defined to be one whose thickness allows rays to refract  as illustrated in  link   but does not allow properties such as dispersion and aberrations
__label__0 an ideal thin lens has two refracting surfaces but the lens is thin enough to assume that light rays bend only once
__label__0 the eye manages this by varying the power  and focal length  of the lens to accommodate for objects at various distances
__label__1 the process of adjusting the eye s focal length is called accommodation
__label__0 a person with normal  ideal  vision can see objects clearly at distances ranging from  cm to essentially infinity
__label__0 more divergent rays from a close object are converged on the retina for a clear image
__label__1 the distance to the farthest object that can be seen clearly is called the far point of the eye  normally infinity
__label__1 farsightedness  or hyperopia  is the inability to see close objects clearly while distant objects may be clear
__label__1 another common vision defect is astigmatism  an unevenness or asymmetry in the focus of the eye
__label__0 for example  rays passing through a vertical region of the eye may focus closer than rays passing through a horizontal region  resulting in the image appearing elongated
__label__0 this is true to an extent  but we find that color perception is even subtler than our eye s response for various wavelengths of light
__label__1 the two major types of light  sensing cells  photoreceptors  in the retina are rods and cones
__label__0 rods are more sensitive than cones by a factor of about  and are solely responsible for peripheral vision as well as vision in very dark environments
__label__0 one theory that takes various factors into account was advanced by edwin land       the creative founder of the polaroid corporation
__label__1 land proposed  based partly on his many elegant experiments  that the three types of cones are organized into systems called retinexes
__label__1 each retinex forms an image that is compared with the others  and the eye  brain system thus can compare a candle  illuminated white table cloth with its generally reddish surroundings and determine that it is actually white
__label__0 if we pass light through smaller openings  often called slits  we can use huygens s principle to see that light bends as sound does  see  link
__label__1 the bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or an obstacle is called diffraction
__label__0 diffraction is a wave characteristic and occurs for all types of waves
__label__0 constructive
__label__0 size   d
__label__0 the brightest colors are those that interfere constructively
__label__0 this interference is between light reflected from different surfaces of a thin film  thus  the effect is known as thin film interference
__label__0 as noticed before  interference effects are most prominent when light interacts with something having a size similar to its wavelength
__label__0 waves having such a direction are said to be polarized
__label__1 for an em wave  we define the direction of polarization to be the direction parallel to the electric field
__label__0 thus we can think of the electric field arrows as showing the direction of polarization  as in  linkan em wave  such as light  is a transverse wave
__label__1 the sun and many other light sources produce waves that are randomly polarized  see  link
__label__0 such light is said to be unpolarized because it is composed of many waves with all possible directions of polarization
__label__1 polaroid materials  invented by the founder of polaroid corporation  edwin land  act as a polarizing slit for light  allowing only polarization in one direction to pass through
__label__1 another interesting phenomenon associated with polarized light is the ability of some crystals to split an unpolarized beam of light into two
__label__0 such crystals are said to be birefringent  see  link
__label__0 each of the separated rays has a specific polarization
__label__1 an inertial frame of reference is a reference frame in which a body at rest remains at rest and a body in motion moves at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted on by an outside force
__label__0 it was not until   when einstein published his first paper on special relativity  that the currently accepted conclusion was reached
__label__0 based mostly on his analysis that the laws of electricity and magnetism would not allow another speed for light  and only slightly aware of the michelson  morley experiment  einstein detailed his second postulate of special relativity
__label__0 second postulate of special relativity
__label__0 an observer of electromagnetic radiation sees relativistic doppler effects if the source of the radiation is moving relative to the observer
__label__0 the wavelength of the radiation is longer  called a red shift  than that emitted by the source when the source moves away from the observer and shorter  called a blue shift  when the source moves toward the observer
__label__0 the type of gas and its temperature  for example  could be determined
__label__1 we now know that these em emissions come from electrons transitioning between energy levels in individual atoms and molecules  thus  they are called atomic spectra
__label__0 atomic spectra remain an important analytical tool today
__label__0 they are akin to lines in atomic spectra  implying the energy levels of atoms are quantized
__label__0 phenomena such as discrete atomic spectra and characteristic x rays are explored further in atomic physics
__label__0 ultraviolet radiation  approximately  ev to  ev  overlaps with the low end of the energy range of x rays  but uv is typically lower in energy
__label__1 uv comes from the de  excitation of atoms that may be part of a hot solid or gas
__label__0 not all molecules have this property
__label__1 air  for example  is nearly transparent to many ir frequencies  microwaves are the highest frequencies that can be produced by electronic circuits  although they are also produced naturally
__label__0 thus microwaves are similar to ir but do not extend to as high frequencies
__label__1 hp  matter and photons     hp  matter and photons   size       h  over  p      where h h size   h    is planck s constant and p p size   p    is momentum
__label__0 this is defined to be the de broglie wavelength
__label__0 note that we already have this for photons  from the equation p  h   p  h   size   p  h
__label__1 particle  wave duality  the fact that all particles have wave properties  is one of the cornerstones of quantum mechanics
__label__1 we first came across it in the treatment of photons  those particles of em radiation that exhibit both particle and wave properties  but not at the same time
__label__1 the english scientist william crookes  among others  continued to study what for some time were called crookes tubes  wherein electrons are freed from atoms and molecules in the rarefied gas inside the tube and are accelerated from the cathode  negative  to the anode  positive  by the high potential
__label__0 these  cathode rays  collide with the gas atoms and molecules and excite them  resulting in the emission of electromagnetic  em  radiation that makes the electrons  path visible as a ray that spreads and fades as it moves away from the cathode
__label__1 gas discharge tubes today are most commonly called cathode  ray tubes  because the rays originate at the cathode
__label__0 crookes showed that the electrons carry momentum  they can make a small paddle wheel rotate
__label__0 hydrogen spectrum wavelength
__label__0 the balmer series requires that n f   n f   size   n rsub  size   f
__label__0 so  if a nucleus has z z size   z    protons  z   z   size   z      for hydrogen   for helium  etc
__label__0 and only one electron  that atom is called a hydrogen  like atom
__label__0 the spectra of hydrogen  like ions are similar to hydrogen  but shifted to higher energy by the greater attractive force between the electron and nucleus
__label__0 each type of atom  or element  has its own characteristic electromagnetic spectrum
__label__0 x rays lie at the high  frequency end of an atom s spectrum and are characteristic of the atom as well
__label__0 in this section  we explore characteristic x rays and some of their important applications
__label__0 we have previously discussed x rays as a part of the electromagnetic spectrum in photon energies and the electromagnetic spectrum
__label__1 once it is excited  the atom can de  excite in several ways  one of which is to re  emit a photon of the same energy as excited it  a single step back to the ground state
__label__0 this is called atomic de  excitation
__label__0 all other paths of de  excitation involve smaller steps  in which lower  energy  longer wavelength  photons are emitted
__label__0 although these level lifetimes are short in human terms  they are many orders of magnitude longer than is typical and  thus  are said to be metastable  meaning relatively stable
__label__1 phosphorescence is the de  excitation of a metastable state
__label__0 glow  in  the  dark materials  such as luminous dials on some watches and clocks and on children s toys and pajamas  are made of phosphorescent substances
__label__1 the name laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation  the process just described
__label__0 the process was proposed and developed following the advances in quantum physics
__label__0 in order to explore the substructure of atoms  and knowing that magnetic fields affect moving charges   the dutch physicist hendrik lorentz      suggested that his student pieter zeeman      study how spectra might be affected by magnetic fields
__label__1 what they found became known as the zeeman effect  which involved spectral lines being split into two or more separate emission lines by an external magnetic field  as shown in  link
__label__0 for their discoveries  zeeman and lorentz shared the  nobel prize in physics
__label__0 physical characteristics that are quantized  such as energy  charge  and angular momentum  are of such importance that names and symbols are given to them
__label__0 the values of quantized entities are expressed in terms of quantum numbers  and the rules governing them are of the utmost importance in determining what nature is and does
__label__0 this section covers some of the more important quantum numbers and rules  all of which apply in chemistry  material science  and far beyond the realm of atomic physics  where they were first discovered
__label__0 the emission of these rays is called nuclear radioactivity or simply radioactivity
__label__0 the rays themselves are called nuclear radiation
__label__1 a nucleus that spontaneously destroys part of its mass to emit radiation is said to decay  a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states
__label__0 apart from  size        size        and   size        there are other forms of nuclear radiation as well  and these also produce ionization with similar effects
__label__1 we define ionizing radiation as any form of radiation that produces ionization whether nuclear in origin or not  since the effects and detection of the radiation are related to ionization
__label__1 these dosimeters  literally  dose meters  are personal radiation monitors that detect the amount of radiation by the discharge of a rechargeable internal capacitor
__label__0 the amount of discharge is related to the amount of ionizing radiation encountered  a measurement of dose
__label__0 the energy of the radiation is sufficient to excite atoms in a material that may fluoresce  such as the phosphor used by rutherford s group
__label__0 materials called scintillators use a more complex collaborative process to convert radiation energy into light
__label__0 scintillators may be liquid or solid  and they can be very efficient
__label__1 we have already identified protons as the particles that carry positive charge in the nuclei
__label__1 however  there are actually two types of particles in the nuclei  the proton and the neutron  referred to collectively as nucleons  the constituents of nuclei
__label__0 decay modes of nuclides out of the region of stability consistently produce nuclides closer to the region of stability
__label__0 there are more stable nuclei having certain numbers of protons and neutrons  called magic numbers
__label__1 magic numbers indicate a shell structure for the nucleus in which closed shells are more stable
__label__0 there are actually three types of beta decay
__label__0 the first discovered was  ordinary  beta decay and is called   size    rsup  size           decay or electron emission
__label__1 antielectrons are the antimatter counterpart to electrons  being nearly identical  having the same mass  spin  and so on  but having a positive charge and an electron family number of
__label__0 when a positron encounters an electron  there is a mutual annihilation in which all the mass of the antielectron  electron pair is converted into pure photon energy
__label__0 the reaction  e   e      e   e      size   e rsup  size         e rsup  size        rightarrow g  g     conserves electron family number as well as all other conserved quantities
__label__0 this reduces it to n   n   size    n  slash
__label__0 for an arbitrary time  not just a multiple of the half  life  the exponential relationship must be used  radioactive dating is a clever use of naturally occurring radioactivity
__label__0 its most famous application is carbon dating
__label__0 we can therefore learn about nuclear forces by examining how tightly bound the nuclei are
__label__1 we define the binding energy  be  of a nucleus to be the energy required to completely disassemble it into separate protons and neutrons
__label__0 we can determine the be of a nucleus from its rest mass
__label__1 second  nuclear radiation depends on the nuclide and not on the chemical compound it is in  so that a radioactive nuclide can be put into a compound designed for specific purposes
__label__0 the compound is said to be tagged
__label__1 a tagged compound used for medical purposes is called a radiopharmaceutical
__label__1 link  shows a patient in a circular array of detectors that may be stationary or rotated  with detector output used by a computer to construct a detailed image
__label__0 this technique is called single  photon  emission computed tomography  spect  or sometimes simply spet
__label__0 the spatial resolution of this technique is poor  about  cm  but the contrast  ie
__label__0 this is due to the body s ability to partially repair the damage
__label__1 any dose less than  msv   rem  is called a low dose   sv to  sv   to  rem  is called a moderate dose  and anything greater than  sv   rem  is called a high dose
__label__0 there is no known way to determine after the fact if a person has been exposed to less than  msv
__label__1 to physically limit radiation doses  we use shielding  increase the distance from a source  and limit the time of exposure
__label__0 worldwide  it is also used to irradiate food  an application that promises to grow in the future
__label__1 food irradiation is the treatment of food with ionizing radiation
__label__0 it is used to reduce pest infestation and to delay spoilage and prevent illness caused by microorganisms
__label__1 nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two nuclei are combined  or fused  to form a larger nucleus
__label__0 we know that all nuclei have less mass than the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons that form them
__label__0 break  even has nearly been reached and gives hope that ignition and commercial plants may become a reality in a few decades  two techniques have shown considerable promise
__label__1 the first of these is called magnetic confinement and uses the property that charged particles have difficulty crossing magnetic field lines
__label__0 the tokamak  shown in  link   has shown particular promise
__label__0 being chargeless  even low  energy neutrons can strike a nucleus and be absorbed once they feel the attractive nuclear force
__label__0 large nuclei are described by a liquid drop model with surface tension and oscillation modes  because the large number of nucleons act like atoms in a drop
__label__0 the neutron is attracted and thus  deposits energy  causing the nucleus to deform as a liquid drop
__label__0 control rods containing nuclides that very strongly absorb neutrons are used to adjust neutron flux
__label__1 to produce large power  reactors contain hundreds to thousands of critical masses  and the chain reaction easily becomes self  sustaining  a condition called criticality
__label__1 neutron flux should be carefully regulated to avoid an exponential increase in fissions  a condition called supercriticality
__label__0 exploring the systematic behavior of their interactions has revealed even more about matter  forces  and energy
__label__1 particle physics deals with the substructures of atoms and nuclei and is particularly aimed at finding those truly fundamental particles that have no further substructure
__label__1 the peduncle attaches the flower to the plant
__label__1 a whorl of sepals  collectively called the calyx  is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the unopened floral bud
__label__0 sepals are usually photosynthetic organs  although there are some exceptions
__label__1 the ovary houses one or more ovules  each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization
__label__1 the ovary houses one or more ovules  each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization
__label__1 the male reproductive organs  the stamens  collectively called the androecium   surround the central carpel
__label__1 stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac  like structure called the anther
__label__1 the other sperm fuses with the n polar nuclei  forming a triploid cell that will develop into the endosperm  which is tissue that serves as a food reserve
__label__1 the zygote develops into an embryo with a radicle  or small root  and one  monocot  or two  dicot  leaf  like organs called cotyledons
__label__1 the zygote develops into an embryo with a radicle  or small root  and one  monocot  or two  dicot  leaf  like organs called cotyledons
__label__0 this difference in the number of embryonic leaves is the basis for the two major groups of angiosperms  the monocots and the eudicots
__label__0 monocots include grasses and lilies  and eudicots or dicots form a polyphyletic group
__label__1 basal angiosperms are a group of plants that are believed to have branched off before the separation into monocots and eudicots because they exhibit traits from both groups
__label__0 they are categorized separately in many classification schemes
__label__1 explore this website for additional information on pollinators  more than  percent of angiosperms depend on animals for pollination  the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma
__label__0 consequently  plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators
__label__0 efforts to preserve biodiversity take several lines of action  from preserving heirloom seeds to barcoding species
__label__1 heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations  as opposed to the seeds used for large  scale agricultural production
__label__1 barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences  taken from a well  characterized portion of the genome  are used to identify a species through dna analysis
__label__0 the first reliable record of gymnosperms dates their appearance to the pennsylvanian period  about  million years ago   link
__label__1 gymnosperms were preceded by progymnosperms  the first naked seed plants  which arose about  million years ago
__label__1 progymnosperms were a transitional group of plants that superficially resembled conifers  cone bearers  because they produced wood from the secondary growth of the vascular tissues  however  they still reproduced like ferns  releasing spores into the environment
__label__0 progymnosperms were a transitional group of plants that superficially resembled conifers  cone bearers  because they produced wood from the secondary growth of the vascular tissues  however  they still reproduced like ferns  releasing spores into the environment
__label__1 seed ferns   link   produced their seeds along their branches without specialized structures
__label__1 what makes them the first true seed plants is that they developed structures called cupules to enclose and protect the ovule  the female gametophyte and associated tissues  which develops into a seed upon fertilization
__label__0 what makes them the first true seed plants is that they developed structures called cupules to enclose and protect the ovule  the female gametophyte and associated tissues  which develops into a seed upon fertilization
__label__0 seed plants resembling modern tree ferns became more numerous and diverse in the coal swamps of the carboniferous period
__label__0 three cell divisions transform the single  celled zygote into an eight  celled structure
__label__1 after further cell division and rearrangement of existing cells  a celled hollow structure called a blastula is formed
__label__1 next  the blastula undergoes further cell division and cellular rearrangement during a process called gastrulation
__label__1 different cell layers  called germ layers  are formed during gastrulation
__label__1 these germ layers are programmed to develop into certain tissue types  organs  and organ systems during a process called organogenesis
__label__1 further subdivision of animals with three germ layers  triploblasts  results in the separation of animals that may develop an internal body cavity derived from mesoderm  called a coelom  and those that do not
__label__0 this epithelial cell  lined coelomic cavity represents a space  usually filled with fluid  which lies between the visceral organs and the body wall
__label__1 a third group of triploblasts has a slightly different coelom derived partly from mesoderm and partly from endoderm  which is found between the two layers
__label__0 although still functional  these are considered false coeloms  and those animals are called pseudocoelomates
__label__1 although still functional  these are considered false coeloms  and those animals are called pseudocoelomates
__label__0 the phylum nematoda  roundworms  is an example of a pseudocoelomate
__label__0 the mouth or anus develops from a structure called the blastopore   link
__label__1 the blastopore is the indentation formed during the initial stages of gastrulation
__label__0 in later stages  a second opening forms  and these two openings will eventually give rise to the mouth and anus   link
__label__0 the earliest distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the type of cleavage undergone by the zygote
__label__1 protostomes undergo spiral cleavage  meaning that the cells of one pole of the embryo are rotated  and thus misaligned  with respect to the cells of the opposite pole
__label__0 this is due to the oblique angle of the cleavage
__label__0 a cell does not have the ability to develop into any cell type
__label__1 in contrast  deuterostomes undergo indeterminate cleavage  in which cells are not yet pre  determined at this early stage to develop into specific cell types

__label__1 the family hominidae of order primates includes the hominoids  the great apes   link
__label__0 evidence from the fossil record and from a comparison of human and chimpanzee dna suggests that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common hominoid ancestor approximately  million years ago
__label__0 its brain size was    cubic centimeters  approximately the size of a modern chimpanzee brain
__label__0 it also had prognathic jaws  which is a relatively longer jaw than that of modern humans
__label__0 in the mids  the fossil of an adult female a afarensis was found in the afar region of ethiopia and dated to  million years ago   link
__label__1 the shoot system generally grows above ground  where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis
__label__1 the root system  which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals  is usually underground
__label__0 link  shows the organ systems of a typical plant
__label__1 meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated  and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant
__label__1 in contrast  permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing
__label__1 lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant
__label__1 intercalary meristems occur only in monocots  at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes  the areas where leaves attach to a stem
__label__0 intercalary meristems occur only in monocots  at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes  the areas where leaves attach to a stem
__label__1 this tissue enables the monocot leaf blade to increase in length from the leaf base  for example  it allows lawn grass leaves to elongate even after repeated mowing
__label__0 the xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other   link
__label__1 in stems  the xylem and the phloem form a structure called a vascular bundle  in roots  this is termed the vascular stele or vascular cylinder
__label__0 this light micrograph shows a cross section of a squash  curcurbita maxima  stem
__label__0 each teardrop  shaped vascular bundle consists of large xylem vessels toward the inside and smaller phloem cells toward the outside

__label__1 an axillary bud is usually found in the axil  the area between the base of a leaf and the stem  where it can give rise to a branch or a flower
__label__1 an axillary bud is usually found in the axil  the area between the base of a leaf and the stem  where it can give rise to a branch or a flower
__label__1 the apex  tip  of the shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud
__label__1 collenchyma cells are elongated cells with unevenly thickened walls   link
__label__0 they provide structural support  mainly to the stem and leaves
__label__1 the dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis  a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying tissue
__label__1 woody plants have a tough  waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark  which further protects the plant from damage
__label__1 epidermal cells are the most numerous and least differentiated of the cells in the epidermis
__label__1 trichomes are hair  like structures on the epidermal surface
__label__1 they help to reduce transpiration  the loss of water by aboveground plant parts   increase solar reflectance  and store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores
__label__0 they help to reduce transpiration  the loss of water by aboveground plant parts   increase solar reflectance  and store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores
__label__1 openings called stomata  singular  stoma  allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and water vapor
__label__0 the  a  colorized scanning  electron micrograph shows a closed stoma of a dicot
__label__1 phloem tissue is composed of sieve  tube cells  companion cells  phloem parenchyma  and phloem fibers
__label__1 a series of sieve  tube cells  also called sieve  tube elements  are arranged end to end to make up a long sieve tube  which transports organic substances such as sugars and amino acids
__label__0 the sugars flow from one sieve  tube cell to the next through perforated sieve plates  which are found at the end junctions between two cells
__label__0 some plants  especially those that are woody  also increase in thickness during their life span
__label__1 the increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth  and is the result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem
__label__1 secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant  and is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem
__label__0 the periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants
__label__1 in some plants  the periderm has many openings  known as lenticels  which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the outside atmosphere   link
__label__0 this supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active cells of the cortex  xylem and phloem
__label__1 corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter
__label__1 stolons are stems that run almost parallel to the ground  or just below the surface  and can give rise to new plants at the nodes
__label__1 runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals  strawberries are an example
__label__1 tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons  and contain many adventitious or unusual buds  familiar to us as the  eyes  on potatoes
__label__1 a bulb  which functions as an underground storage unit  is a modification of a stem that has the appearance of enlarged fleshy leaves emerging from the stem or surrounding the base of the stem  as seen in the iris
__label__0 most roots are underground
__label__1 some plants  however  also have adventitious roots  which emerge above the ground from the shoot
__label__0 when the plant embryo emerges from the seed  the radicle of the embryo forms the root system
__label__1 the tip of the root is protected by the root cap  a structure exclusive to roots and unlike any other plant structure
__label__0 the root cap is continuously replaced because it gets damaged easily as the root pushes through soil
__label__1 the vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root  which is called the stele   link
__label__1 a layer of cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root
__label__0 the endodermis is exclusive to roots  and serves as a checkpoint for materials entering the root s vascular system
__label__1 each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina  which is also the widest part of the leaf
__label__0 some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole
__label__1 leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves
__label__1 small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules
__label__1 most leaves have a midrib  which travels the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue
__label__0 in an opposite leaf arrangement  two leaves arise at the same point  with the leaves connecting opposite each other along the branch
__label__1 if there are three or more leaves connected at a node  the leaf arrangement is classified as whorled
__label__0 each leaflet may have its own stalk  but is attached to the rachis

__label__0 common name  umbrella plant
__label__1 water potential is a measure of the potential energy in water
__label__0 plant physiologists are not interested in the energy in any one particular aqueous system  but are very interested in water movement between two systems
__label__1 transpiration  the loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through stomata  is a passive process  meaning that metabolic energy in the form of atp is not required for water movement
__label__0 the energy driving transpiration is the difference in energy between the water in the soil and the water in the atmosphere
__label__1 structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources
__label__0 sugars produced in sources  such as leaves  need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation
__label__1 the points of sugar delivery  such as roots  young shoots  and developing seeds  are called sinks
__label__0 it allows plants to optimize their use of light and space
__label__1 photoperiodism is the ability to use light to track time
__label__0 plants can tell the time of day and time of year by sensing and using various wavelengths of sunlight

__label__0 phytochromes have two photo  interconvertible forms  pr and pfr
__label__1 gravitropism ensures that roots grow into the soil and that shoots grow toward sunlight
__label__1 growth of the shoot apical tip upward is called negative gravitropism  whereas growth of the roots downward is called positive gravitropism
__label__1 apical dominance  the inhibition of lateral bud formation  is triggered by auxins produced in the apical meristem
__label__1 flowering  fruit setting and ripening  and inhibition of abscission  leaf falling  are other plant responses under the direct or indirect control of auxins
__label__0 auxins also act as a relay for the effects of the blue light and red  far  red responses
__label__1 the plant hormone abscisic acid  aba  was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping of cotton bolls
__label__0 however  more recent studies indicate that aba plays only a minor role in the abscission process
__label__1 oligosaccharins also play a role in plant defense against bacterial and fungal infections
__label__0 they act locally at the site of injury  and can also be transported to other tissues
__label__0 cells in contact with a support surface contract  whereas cells on the opposite side of the support expand   link
__label__0 application of jasmonic acid is sufficient to trigger tendril coiling without a mechanical stimulus

__label__0 in the venus flytrap  two modified leaves are joined at a hinge and lined with thin fork  like tines along the outer edges
__label__0 carbon that was obtained from atmospheric co composes the majority of the dry mass within most plants
__label__0 an inorganic compound does not contain carbon and is not part of  or produced by  a living organism
__label__1 inorganic substances  which form the majority of the soil solution  are commonly called minerals  those required by plants include nitrogen  n  and potassium  k  for structure and regulation
__label__0 in addition to macronutrients  organisms require various elements in small amounts
__label__0 these micronutrients  or trace elements  are present in very small quantities

__label__1 the organic material of soil  called humus  is made up of microorganisms  dead and alive   and dead animals and plants in varying stages of decay
__label__0 in the s  edith bolling wilson took a more active but still private role assisting her husband  president woodrow wilson  afflicted by a stroke  in the last years of his presidency
__label__0 however  as the niece of one president and the wife of another  it was eleanor roosevelt in the s and s who opened the door for first ladies to do something more
__label__0 while running for the presidency for the first time in   bill clinton frequently touted the experience and capabilities of his wife
__label__0 there was a lot to brag about
__label__0 the president also exercises the power of pardon without conditions
__label__0 once used fairly sparingly  apart from andrew johnson s wholesale pardons of former confederates during the reconstruction period  the pardon power has become more visible in recent decades
__label__0 these fears mingled with existing anti  japanese sentiment across the country and created a paranoia that washed over the west coast like a large wave
__label__1 in an attempt to calm fears and prevent any real fifth  column actions  president franklin d roosevelt signed executive order   which authorized the removal of people from military areas as necessary
__label__0 when the military dubbed the entire west coast a military area  it effectively allowed for the removal of more than  japanese americans from their homes
__label__1 on the other hand  signing statements are statements issued by a president when agreeing to legislation that indicate how the chief executive will interpret and enforce the legislation in question
__label__0 signing statements are less powerful than vetoes  though congressional opponents have complained that they derail legislative intent
__label__0 the constitution also limits the supreme court s original jurisdiction to those rare cases of disputes between states  or between the united states and foreign ambassadors or ministers
__label__1 so  for the most part  the supreme court is an appeals court  operating under appellate jurisdiction and hearing appeals from the lower courts
__label__0 the rest of the development of the judicial system and the creation of the lower courts were left in the hands of congress
__label__1 in their first case of significance  chisholm v georgia     the justices ruled that the federal courts could hear cases brought by a citizen of one state against a citizen of another state  and that article iii  section   of the constitution did not protect the states from facing such an interstate lawsuit
__label__0 chisholm v georgia   us
__label__0 however  their decision was almost immediately overturned by the eleventh amendment  passed by congress in  and ratified by the states in
__label__1 in protecting the states  the eleventh amendment put a prohibition on the courts by stating   the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity  commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state  or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state
__label__0 it was an early hint that congress had the power to change the jurisdiction of the courts as it saw fit and stood ready to use it  in an atmosphere of perceived weakness  the first chief justice  john jay  an author of the federalist papers and appointed by president george washington  resigned his post to become governor of new york and later declined president john adams s offer of a subsequent term  associated press
__label__0 what you should know about forgotten founding father john jay   pbs newshour
__label__0 if the courts find an action to be unconstitutional  it becomes null and void
__label__1 judicial review was established in the supreme court case marbury v madison  when  for the first time  the court declared an act of congress to be unconstitutional  marbury v madison   us
__label__1 judicial review was established in the supreme court case marbury v madison  when  for the first time  the court declared an act of congress to be unconstitutional  marbury v madison   us
__label__0 wielding this power is a role marshall defined as the  very essence of judicial duty   and it continues today as one of the most significant aspects of judicial power
__label__0 judicial review lies at the core of the court s ability to check the other branches of government  and the states
__label__0 president adams had appointed william marbury to a position in washington  dc  but his commission was not delivered before adams left office
__label__0 so marbury petitioned the supreme court to use its power under the judiciary act of  and issue a writ of mandamus to force the new president s secretary of state  james madison  to deliver the commission documents
__label__0 it was a task madison refused to do
__label__0 the federal court system is most often called upon when a case touches on constitutional rights
__label__0 for example  when samantha elauf  a muslim woman  was denied a job working for the clothing retailer abercrombie  fitch because a headscarf she wears as religious practice violated the company s dress code  the supreme court ruled that her first amendment rights had been violated  making it possible for her to sue the store for monetary damages
__label__0 in a number of cases  they have expressed reluctance to expand rights without limit  and they still balance that expansion with the government s need to govern  provide for the common good  and serve a broader societal purpose
__label__1 for example  the supreme court has upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty  ruling that the eighth amendment does not prevent a person from being put to death for committing a capital crime and that the government may consider  retribution and the possibility of deterrence  when it seeks capital punishment for a crime that so warrants it
__label__0 gregg v georgia   us
__label__0 in other words  there is a greater good  more safety and security  that may be more important than sparing the life of an individual who has committed a heinous crime
__label__0 courts hear two different types of disputes  criminal and civil
__label__0 under criminal law  governments establish rules and punishments  laws define conduct that is prohibited because it can harm others and impose punishment for committing such an act
__label__1 crimes are usually labeled felonies or misdemeanors based on their nature and seriousness  felonies are the more serious crimes
__label__1 the federal courts  on the other hand  will hear any case that involves a foreign government  patent or copyright infringement  native american rights  maritime law  bankruptcy  or a controversy between two or more states
__label__0 cases arising from activities across state lines  interstate commerce  are also subject to federal court jurisdiction  as are cases in which the united states is a party
__label__0 there are ninety  four us district courts in the fifty states and us territories  of which eighty  nine are in the states  at least one in each state
__label__0 the others are in washington  dc  puerto rico  guam  the us virgin islands  and the northern mariana islands
__label__0 today s federal court system was not an overnight creation  it has been changing and transitioning for more than two hundred years through various acts of congress
__label__1 since district courts are not called for in article iii of the constitution  congress established them and narrowly defined their jurisdiction  at first limiting them to handling only cases that arose within the district
__label__0 beginning in  when there were just thirteen  the district courts became the basic organizational units of the federal judicial system
__label__1 the us court system operates on the principle of stare decisis  latin for stand by things decided   which means that today s decisions are based largely on rulings from the past  and tomorrow s rulings rely on what is decided today
__label__0 stare decisis is especially important in the us common law system  in which the consistency of precedent ensures greater certainty and stability in law and constitutional interpretation  and it also contributes to the solidity and legitimacy of the court system itself
__label__0 at the federal level  the president nominates a candidate to a judgeship or justice position  and the nominee must be confirmed by a majority vote in the us senate  a function of the senate s  advice and consent  role
__label__0 all judges and justices in the national courts serve lifetime terms of office
__label__0 since their appointments  both justices have made rulings consistent with a more liberal ideology
__label__0 the death of justice antonin scalia in february  has prompted the most recent discussion of appointing a new justice  with obama nominating merrick garland to fill the vacant seat
__label__0 however  action on this nominee is unlikely given the election of republican donald trump to the presidency
__label__0 sandra day oconnor  nominated by republican president ronald reagan  often became a champion for women s rights
__label__0 david souter  nominated by republican george h w bush  more often than not sided with the court s liberal wing
__label__0 and even on the present  day court  anthony kennedy  a reagan appointee  has become notorious as the court s swing vote  sometimes siding with the more conservative justices but sometimes not
__label__0 for better or worse  sometimes it is only a controversial nominee who leaves a president s legacy behind
__label__0 for example  the reagan presidency is often remembered for two controversial nominees to the supreme court  robert bork and douglas ginsburg  the former accused of taking an overly conservative and  extremist view of the constitution  john m broder
__label__0 edward m kennedy  senate stalwart  is dead at

__label__1 the supreme court of the united states  sometimes abbreviated scotus  is a one  of  a  kind institution
__label__0 while a look at the supreme court typically focuses on the nine justices themselves  they represent only the top layer of an entire branch of government that includes many administrators  lawyers  and assistants who contribute to and help run the overall judicial system
__label__0 with the death of associate justice antonin scalia in february   there remain three current justices who are considered part of the court s more conservative wing  chief justice roberts and associate justices thomas and alito  while four are considered more liberal  leaning  justices ginsburg  breyer  sotomayor  and kagan   link
__label__0 justice kennedy has become known as the  swing  vote  particularly on decisions like the court s same  sex marriage rulings in   because he sometimes takes a more liberal position and sometimes a more conservative one
__label__0 had the democrats retained the presidency in   the replacement for scalia s spot on the court could have swung many key votes in a moderate or liberal direction
__label__0 the supreme court begins its annual session on the first monday in october and ends late the following june
__label__0 every year  there are literally thousands of people who would like to have their case heard before the supreme court  but the justices will select only a handful to be placed on the docket  which is the list of cases scheduled on the court s calendar
__label__0 the court typically accepts fewer than  percent of the as many as ten thousand cases it is asked to review every year
__label__0 supreme court procedures   united states courts
__label__1 most often  the petitioner is asking the supreme court to grant a writ of certiorari  a request that the lower court send up its record of the case for review
__label__0 once a writ of certiorari  cert
__label__1 the solicitor general is the lawyer who represents the federal government before the supreme court  he or she decides which cases  in which the united states is a party  should be appealed from the lower courts and personally approves each one presented   link
__label__0 most of the cases the solicitor general brings to the court will be given a place on the docket
__label__0 if not  then the most senior justice ruling with the majority chooses the writer
__label__1 likewise  the most senior justice in the dissenting group can assign a member of that group to write the dissenting opinion  however  any justice who disagrees with the majority may write a separate dissenting opinion
__label__1 if a justice agrees with the outcome of the case but not with the majority s reasoning in it  that justice may write a concurring opinion
__label__0 by   thirty  six states had repealed their sodomy laws  and most states were only selectively enforcing them
__label__0 changes in state laws  along with an emerging lgbt movement  no doubt swayed the court and led it to the reversal of its earlier ruling with the  decision  lawrence v texas   link
__label__0 lawrence v texas   us
__label__1 but the most significant check on the supreme court is executive and legislative leverage over the implementation and enforcement of its rulings
__label__0 this process is called judicial implementation
__label__0 while it is true that courts play a major role in policymaking  they have no mechanism to make their rulings a reality
__label__0 
__label__0 president andrew jackson is reported to have said   john marshall has made his decision  now let him enforce it   and the court s ruling was basically ignored
__label__0 court history   supreme court history  the first hundred years
__label__0 httpwwwpbsorgwnetsupremecourtantebellumhistoryhtml  march
__label__0 abraham lincoln  too  famously ignored chief justice roger b taney s order finding unconstitutional lincoln s suspension of habeas corpus rights in   early in the civil war
__label__0 the constitution allocated more power to the federal government by effectively adding two new branches  a president to head the executive branch and the supreme court to head the judicial branch
__label__0 the specific delegated or expressed powers granted to congress and to the president were clearly spelled out in the body of the constitution under article i  section   and article ii  sections  and
__label__0 in addition to these expressed powers  the national government was given implied powers that  while not clearly stated  are inferred
__label__1 these powers stem from the elastic clause in article i  section   of the constitution  which provides congress the authority  to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers
__label__0 this statement has been used to support the federal government s playing a role in controversial policy matters  such as the provision of healthcare  the expansion of power to levy and collect taxes  and regulation of interstate commerce
__label__1 finally  article vi declared that the us constitution and any laws or treaties made in connection with that document were to supersede constitutions and laws made at the state level
__label__0 throughout us history  the national and state governments have battled for dominance over the implementation of public policy and the funding of important political programs
__label__0 upon taking office in  during the great depression     president franklin d roosevelt initiated a series of legislative proposals to boost the economy and put people back to work
__label__0 the enacted programs allowed the federal government to play a broader role in revitalizing the economy while greatly expanding its power
__label__1 johnson declared a  war on poverty   instituting a package of great society programs designed to improve circumstances for lower  income americans across the nation
__label__0 the new programs included medicare and medicaid  which are health insurance programs for seniors and low  income citizens respectively  and the food stamp program  which provides food assistance to low  income families
__label__0 these initiatives greatly expanded the role of the federal government in providing a social safety net  karen tumulty    great society  agenda led to great  and lasting  philosophical divide   washington post   january   httpwwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsgreatsocietyagendaledtogreatandlastingphilosophicaldividebeddebceecastoryhtml
__label__0 state and local governments became partners in their implementation and also came to rely on the financial support they received from the federal government in the form of program grants  michael schuyler
__label__0 in   oregon became the first state to switch to mail  in voting when citizens passed a ballot measure for it to take effect
__label__0 in march   governor kate brown took another step to expand the voting franchise
__label__0 she signed a bill into law that makes voter registration automatic for all citizens in the state with a driver s license
__label__0 given their focus on pursuing individual objectives  states with an individualistic mindset will tend to advance tax breaks as a way of trying to boost a state s economy or as a mechanism for promoting individual initiative and entrepreneurship
__label__0 for instance  new jersey governor chris christie made headlines in  when discussing the incentives he used to attract businesses to the state
__label__0 christie encouraged a number of businesses to move to camden  where unemployment has risen to almost  percent  by providing them with hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks  dean dechiaro     m in tax breaks later  christie says his camden plan wo nt work for america   us
__label__0 several critiques have come to light since elazar first introduced his theory of state political culture fifty years ago
__label__1 the original theory rested on the assumption that new cultures could arise with the influx of settlers from different parts of the world  however  since immigration patterns have changed over time  it could be argued that the three cultures no longer match the country s current reality
__label__0 as an example of the frankenstein veto  when an appropriations bill was sent to wisconsin governor james e doyle for signature in   doyle scrapped over seven hundred words from a passage that would have appropriated millions of dollars to transportation
__label__0 the words that remained in the bill redirected those funds to education
__label__0 for example  texas governor greg abbott made headlines in  for writing to the ceo of general electric  ge   urging the company to relocate its corporate headquarters from connecticut  which had just raised its corporate tax rate  to texas  patrick svitek   abbott tries wooing general electric to texas   the texas tribune   june   httpswwwtexastribuneorgabbottlookswoogeneralelectricconnecticut
__label__0 as his state s spokesperson  abbott promoted texas s friendly corporate tax structure and investment in transportation and education funding in hopes of enticing ge to relocate there and bring economic opportunities with it
__label__0 the company has since decided to relocate to boston  after receiving incentives  worth up to   million  from massachusetts officials  ted mann and jon kamp   general electric to move headquarters to boston   the wall street journal   january   httpwwwwsjcomarticlesgeneralelectricplanstomoveheadquarterstoboston
__label__0 another example involved texas governor rick perry touring california in  in order to bring prospective businesses from the golden state to texas
__label__0 new jersey governor chris christie gained national attention in  over his handling of the aftermath of hurricane sandy  which caused an estimated   billion worth of damage and cost the lives of over  individuals along the east coast of the united states october
__label__0 these images show just how much some neighborhoods were changed by hurricane sandy   httpwwwhuffingtonpostcomhurricanesandysecondanniversaryimagesnhtml
__label__0 christie was famously photographed with president obama during their joint tour of the damaged areas  and the governor subsequently praised the president for his response   link
__label__0 although they may choose to exercise this formal power only during the closing days of their term  if at all  most governors have the authority to grant pardons just as us presidents do
__label__0 a pardon absolves someone of blame for a crime and can secure his or her release from prison
__label__0 governors can also commute sentences  reducing the time an individual must servepardons  reprieves  commutations and respites   httpwwwsoswvgov  public  services  execrecords  pages  pardonsaspx  march
__label__0 if there are doubts about the person s guilt  concerns about his or her mental health  or reason to feel the punishment was inappropriately harsh

__label__0 new york  atherton press
__label__1 a delegate legislator represents the will of those who elected him or her to office and acts in their expressed interest  even when it goes against personal belief about what is ultimately in the constituency s best interest
__label__0 on the other hand  trustees believe they were elected to exercise their own judgment and know best because they have the time and expertise to study and understand an issue
__label__0 race and turnout  does descriptive representation in state legislatures increase minority voting   political research quarterly   no
__label__0 
__label__0 thus  increased diversity in state legislatures can have consequences for voter engagement and for the type of legislation pursued and passed within these bodies
__label__0 under consecutive term limits  a member can serve for only a specified period of time in either the state house or the state senate  most commonly eight years
__label__0 to try to regain a seat in the legislature once the limit has been met  the member will have to wait to run for office again
__label__0 interest groups may thus enjoy greater ability to set the agenda and push for policy that favors their organization
__label__0 this same research also found that under term limits state legislators feel they have lost power relative to the governor and to various bureaucratic agency officials
__label__0 see note above
__label__0 this presumed loss of power could damage the state legislature s ability to adequately check the actions of the executive branch and to perform legislative functions  such as oversight
__label__0 the activities by which government achieves these functions include  but are not limited to  taxation  homeland security  immigration  foreign affairs  and education
__label__0 the more society grows and the need for government services expands  the more challenging bureaucratic management and public administration becomes
__label__0 public administration is both the implementation of public policy in government bureaucracies and the academic study that prepares civil servants for work in those organizations
__label__0 under president george washington  the bureaucracy remained small enough to accomplish only the necessary tasks at hand  for the early origins of the us bureaucracy see michael nelson
__label__0 
__label__0 with the onset of the great depression in   the united states faced record levels of unemployment and the associated fall into poverty  food shortages  and general desperation
__label__0 when the republican president and congress were not seen as moving aggressively enough to fix the situation  the democrats won the  election in overwhelming fashion
__label__0 while the federal bureaucracy grew by leaps and bounds during the twentieth century  it also underwent a very different evolution
__label__0 beginning with the pendleton act in the s  the bureaucracy shifted away from the spoils system toward a merit system
__label__0 the distinction between these two forms of bureaucracy is crucial
__label__0 the classic model of bureaucracy is typically called the ideal weberian model  and it was developed by max weber  an early german sociologist
__label__0 weber argued that the increasing complexity of life would simultaneously increase the demands of citizens for government services
__label__0 elected officials are regularly frustrated when bureaucrats seem not follow the path they intended
__label__0 as a result  the bureaucratic process becomes inundated with red tape
__label__1 this is the name for the procedures and rules that must be followed to get something done
__label__0 in this photograph  lois lerner  the former director of the internal revenue service s exempt organizations unit  sits before an oversight committee in congress following a  investigation
__label__0 on the advice of her attorney  lerner invoked her fifth amendment right not to incriminate herself and refused to answer questions
__label__1 the act s merit systems protection board is a quasi  juridical institutional board headed by three members appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate that hears complaints  conducts investigations into possible abuses  and institutes protections for bureaucrats who speak out
__label__0 campbell   civil service reform
__label__0 over time  congress and the president have strengthened these protections with additional acts
__label__0 these include the whistleblower protection act of  and the whistleblower protection enhancement act of   which further compelled federal agencies to protect whistleblowers who reasonably perceive that an institution or the people in the institution are acting inappropriately   link
__label__1 one approach to thinking about public policy is to see it as the broad strategy government uses to do its job
__label__0 more formally  it is the relatively stable set of purposive governmental actions that address matters of concern to some part of society  james e anderson
__label__1 forests  water  and fisheries  however  are a type of public good called common goods  which are not excludable but may be finite
__label__0 the problem with both public and common goods is that since no one owns them  no one has a financial interest in protecting their long  term or future value
__label__0 without government regulation  a factory owner can feel free to pollute the air or water  since he or she will have no responsibility for the pollution once the winds or waves carry it somewhere else  see  link
__label__0 in   theodore lowi argued that it was possible to categorize policy based upon the degree to which costs and benefits were concentrated on the few or diffused across the many
__label__1 one policy category  known as distributive policy  tends to collect payments or resources from many but concentrates direct benefits on relatively few
__label__1 while distributive policy  according to lowi  has diffuse costs and concentrated benefits  regulatory policy features the opposite arrangement  with concentrated costs and diffuse benefits
__label__0 a relatively small number of groups or individuals bear the costs of regulatory policy  but its benefits are expected to be distributed broadly across society
__label__1 a final type of policy is redistributive policy  so named because it redistributes resources in society from one group to another
__label__0 that is  according to lowi  the costs are concentrated and so are the benefits  but different groups bear the costs and enjoy the benefits
__label__0 after completing a minimum number of years of work  american workers may claim a form of pension upon reaching retirement age
__label__1 it is often called an entitlement program since it guarantees benefits to a particular group  and virtually everyone will eventually qualify for the plan given the relatively low requirements for enrollment
__label__0 the amount of money a worker receives is based loosely on his or her lifetime earnings
__label__1 medicaid is a formula  based  health insurance program  which means beneficiaries must demonstrate they fall within a particular income category
__label__0 individuals in the medicaid program receive a fairly comprehensive set of health benefits  although access to health care may be limited because fewer providers accept payments from the program  it pays them less for services than does medicare
__label__0 a lobbying group that frequently takes on advocacy roles is aarp  formerly the american association of retired persons    link
__label__1 aarp s primary job is to convince the government to provide more public resources and services to senior citizens  often through regulatory or redistributive politics
__label__1 the policy process contains four sequential stages     agenda setting     policy enactment     policy implementation  and    evaluation
__label__0 given the sheer number of issues already processed by the government  called the continuing agenda  and the large number of new proposals being pushed at any one time  it is typically quite difficult to move a new policy all the way through the process
__label__0 agenda setting is the crucial first stage of the public policy process
__label__0 
__label__0 roosevelt sought to implement a new approach to economic regulation known as keynesianism
__label__1 named for its developer  the economist john maynard keynes  keynesian economics argues that it is possible for a recession to become so deep  and last for so long  that the typical models of economic collapse and recovery may not work
__label__0 keynes suggested that economic growth was closely tied to the ability of individuals to consume goods
__label__0 portions of the budget not devoted to mandatory spending are categorized as discretionary spending because congress must pass legislation to authorize money to be spent each year
__label__0 about  percent of the approximately   trillion set aside for discretionary spending each year pays for most of the operations of government  including employee salaries and the maintenance of federal buildings
__label__0 as you would expect  keynesians and supply  siders disagree about which forms of tax policy are best
__label__0 keynesians  with their concern about whether consumers can really stimulate demand  prefer progressive taxes systems that increase the effective tax rate as the taxpayer s income increases
__label__0 this policy leaves those most likely to spend their money with more money to spend
__label__0 financial panics arise when too many people  worried about the solvency of their investments  try to withdraw their money at the same time
__label__0 such panics plagued us banks until    link    when congress enacted the federal reserve act
__label__1 the act established the federal reserve system  also known as the fed  as the central bank of the united states
__label__0 if the european continent was stable  so too was the world
__label__0 during the cold war era that followed world war ii  stability was achieved by the existence of dual superpowers  the united states and the soviet union  and by the real fear of the nuclear annihilation of which both were capable
__label__0 until approximately   advanced industrial democracies aligned themselves behind one of these two superpowers
__label__0 one of the unique and challenging aspects of global affairs is the fact that no world  level authority exists to mandate when and how the world s nations interact
__label__0 after the failed attempt by president woodrow wilson and others to formalize a  league of nations  in the wake of world war i in the s  and on the heels of a worldwide depression that began in   came world war ii  history s deadliest military conflict
__label__0 now  in the early decades of the twenty  first century  it is common to think of the september  terrorist attacks in  as the big game  changer
__label__1 the balance of trade is the relationship between a country s inflow and outflow of goods
__label__1 the united states sells many goods and services around the world  but overall it maintains a trade deficit  in which more goods and services are coming in from other countries than are going out to be sold overseas
__label__0 at the more serious end of the foreign policy decision  making spectrum  and usually as a last resort when diplomacy fails  the us military and defense establishment exists to provide the united states the ability to wage war against other state and nonstate actors
__label__0 such war can be offensive  as were the iraq war in  and the  removal of panamanian leader manuel noriega
__label__0 or it can be defensive  as a means to respond to aggression from others  such as the persian gulf war in   also known as operation desert storm   link
__label__0 this makes diplomacy and international coordination an ongoing bargain as issues evolve and governmental leaders and nations change
__label__0 foreign relations are certainly made smoother by the existence of cross  national voluntary associations like the united nations  the organization of american states  and the african union
__label__1 flash mobs are examples of collective behavior  noninstitutionalized activity in which several or many people voluntarily engage
__label__0 other examples are a group of commuters traveling home from work and a population of teens adopting a favorite singer s hairstyle
__label__1 casual crowds consist of people who are in the same place at the same time but who are nt really interacting  such as people standing in line at the post office
__label__1 conventional crowds are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly  like a religious service
__label__1 expressive crowds are people who join together to express emotion  often at funerals  weddings  or the like
__label__1 the final type  acting crowds  focuses on a specific goal or action  such as a protest movement or riot  in addition to the different types of crowds  collective groups can also be identified in two other ways
__label__1 a mass is a relatively large number of people with a common interest  though they may not be in close proximity  lofland    such as players of the popular facebook game farmville
__label__1 a public  on the other hand  is an unorganized  relatively diffused group of people who share ideas  such as the libertarian political party
__label__1 neil smelser s    meticulous categorization of crowd behavior  called value  added theory  is a perspective within the functionalist tradition based on the idea that several conditions must be in place for collective behavior to occur
__label__0 each condition adds to the likelihood that collective behavior will occur
__label__0 social organizations worldwide take stands on such general areas of concern as poverty  sex trafficking  and the use of genetically modified organisms  gmos  in food
__label__0 nongovernmental organizations  ngos  are sometimes formed to support such movements  such as the international federation of organic agriculture movement  foam
__label__0 global efforts to reduce poverty are represented by the oxford committee for famine relief  oxfam   among others
__label__0 is a revolutionary movement
__label__1 religious  redemptive movements are  meaning seeking   and their goal is to provoke inner change or spiritual growth in individuals
__label__0 organizations pushing these movements include heaven s gate or the branch davidians
__label__0 resource mobilization
__label__1 mccarthy and zald    conceptualize resource mobilization theory as a way to explain movement success in terms of the ability to acquire resources and mobilize individuals
__label__0 resources are primarily time and money  and the more of both  the greater the power of organized movements
__label__0 successful social movements use three kinds of frames  snow and benford   to further their goals
__label__1 the first type  diagnostic framing  states the problem in a clear  easily understood way
__label__0 when applying diagnostic frames  there are no shades of gray  instead  there is the belief that what  they  do is wrong and this is how  we  will fix it
__label__0 in the gay marriage movement  a call to action might encourage you to vote  no  on proposition  in california  a move to limit marriage to male  female couples   or conversely  to contact your local congressperson to express your viewpoint that marriage should be restricted to male  female couples
__label__0 with so many similar diagnostic frames  some groups find it best to join together to maximize their impact
__label__0 when social movements link their goals to the goals of other social movements and merge into a single group  a frame alignment process  snow et al
__label__1 occurs  an ongoing and intentional means of recruiting participants to the movement
__label__0 how has this technology affected social change in our society and others
__label__1 one very positive way is crowdsourcing  thanks to the web  digital crowdsourcing is the process of obtaining needed services  ideas  or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people  and especially from an online community rather than from traditional employees or suppliers
__label__0 web  based companies such as kickstarter have been created precisely for the purposes of raising large amounts of money in a short period of time  notably by sidestepping the traditional financing process
__label__1 sociology is the study of groups and group interactions  societies and social interactions  from small and personal groups to very large groups
__label__1 a group of people who live in a defined geographic area  who interact with one another  and who share a common culture is what sociologists call a society
__label__0 sociologists study all aspects and levels of society
__label__0 it is impossible to study one without the other
__label__1 german sociologist norbert elias called the process of simultaneously analyzing the behavior of individuals and the society that shapes that behavior figuration
__label__0 an application that makes this concept understandable is the practice of religion
__label__0 this even applied to the researchers themselves  who  they believed  should be aware of how their own cultural biases could influence their research
__label__1 to deal with this problem  weber and dilthey introduced the concept of verstehen  a german word that means to understand in a deep way
__label__0 in seeking verstehen  outside observers of a social world  an entire culture or a small setting  attempt to understand it from an insider s point of view
__label__0 in his book the nature of social action     weber described sociology as striving to
__label__0 researchers analyze data using statistical techniques to see if they can uncover patterns of human behavior
__label__1 qualitative sociology seeks to understand human behavior by learning about it through in  depth interviews  focus groups  and analysis of content sources  like books  magazines  journals  and popular media
__label__1 macro  level theories relate to large  scale issues and large groups of people  while micro  level theories look at very specific relationships between individuals or small groups
__label__1 grand theories attempt to explain large  scale relationships and answer fundamental questions such as why societies form and why they change
__label__0 sociological theory is constantly evolving and should never be considered complete
__label__0 functionalism grew out of the writings of english philosopher and biologist  hebert spencer       who saw similarities between society and the human body  he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning  the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning  spencer
__label__1 the parts of society that spencer referred to were the social institutions  or patterns of beliefs and behaviors focused on meeting social needs  such as government  education  family  healthcare  religion  and the economy
__label__0 durkheim believed that individuals may make up society  but in order to study society  sociologists have to look beyond individuals to social facts
__label__1 social facts are the laws  morals  values  religious beliefs  customs  fashions  rituals  and all of the cultural rules that govern social life  durkheim
__label__0 each of these social facts serves one or more functions within a society
__label__0 conflict theory
__label__1 conflict theory looks at society as a competition for limited resources
__label__0 this perspective is a macro  level approach most identified with the writings of german philosopher and sociologist karl marx       who saw society as being made up of individuals in different social classes who must compete for social  material  and political resources such as food and housing  employment  education  and leisure time
__label__1 constructivism is an extension of symbolic interaction theory which proposes that reality is what humans cognitively construct it to be
__label__0 we develop social constructs based on interactions with others  and those constructs that last over time are those that have meanings which are widely agreed  upon or generally accepted by most within the society
__label__0 people commonly try to understand the happenings in their world by finding or creating an explanation for an occurrence
__label__0 social scientists may develop a hypothesis for the same reason
__label__1 a hypothesis is a testable educated guess about predicted outcomes between two or more variables  it s a possible explanation for specific happenings in the social world and allows for testing to determine whether the explanation holds true in many instances  as well as among various groups or in different places
__label__0 reliability increases the likelihood that what happens to one person will happen to all people in a group
__label__1 researchers also strive for validity  which refers to how well the study measures what it was designed to measure
__label__0 returning to the crime rate during a full moon topic  reliability of a study would reflect how well the resulting experience represents the average adult crime rate during a full moon
__label__1 a hypothesis is an assumption about how two or more variables are related  it makes a conjectural statement about the relationship between those variables
__label__0 in sociology  the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another
__label__0 while many sociologists rely on the scientific method as a research approach  others operate from an interpretive framework
__label__0 while systematic  this approach does nt follow the hypothesis  testing model that seeks to find generalizable results
__label__1 as a research method  a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions  often in the form of a questionnaire
__label__0 the survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods
__label__0 the success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample
__label__1 in a random sample  every person in a population has the same chance of being chosen for the study
__label__0 according to the laws of probability  random samples represent the population as a whole
__label__0 the researcher will end up with a wide range of responses  some of which may be surprising
__label__0 the benefit of written opinions  though  is the wealth of material that they provide
__label__1 an interview is a one  on  one conversation between the researcher and the subject  and it is a way of conducting surveys on a topic
__label__0 interviews are similar to the short  answer questions on surveys in that the researcher asks subjects a series of questions
__label__0 later  he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some details of the story and the new yorker issued an apology
__label__0 however  rothman s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a  dot com  company and exemplified the lengths to which a sociologist will go to uncover material
__label__1 rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation  in which researchers join people and participate in a group s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context
__label__0 this method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life
__label__1 one way researchers test social theories is by conducting an experiment  meaning they investigate relationships to test a hypothesis  a scientific approach
__label__0 a researcher will need to do some legwork to track them down and gain access to records
__label__1 to guide the search through a vast library of materials and avoid wasting time reading unrelated sources  sociologists employ content analysis  applying a systematic approach to record and value information gleaned from secondary data as they relate to the study at hand
__label__0 or if you are having coffee with a good friend  perhaps that question warrants a more detailed response
__label__1 these examples are all aspects of culture  which is shared beliefs  values  and practices  that participants must learn
__label__0 sociologically  we examine in what situation and context certain behavior is expected  and in which situations perhaps it is not
__label__1 ethnocentrism  or evaluating and judging another culture based on how it compares to one s own cultural norms
__label__0 ethnocentrism  as sociologist william graham sumner    described the term  involves a belief or attitude that one s own culture is better than all others
__label__0 values are deeply embedded and critical for transmitting and teaching a culture s beliefs
__label__1 beliefs are the tenets or convictions that people hold to be true
__label__0 individuals in a society have specific beliefs  but they also share collective values
__label__0 a boy who helps an elderly woman board a bus may receive a smile and a  thank you   a business manager who raises profit margins may receive a quarterly bonus
__label__0 people sanction certain behaviors by giving their support  approval  or permission  or by instilling formal actions of disapproval and nonsupport
__label__1 sanctions are a form of social control  a way to encourage conformity to cultural norms
__label__1 formal norms are established  written rules
__label__0 they are behaviors worked out and agreed upon in order to suit and serve the most people
__label__1 writing another person s words as if they are one s own has a name  plagiarism
__label__0 the consequences for violating this norm are severe and usually result in expulsion
__label__1 unlike mores  folkways are norms without any moral underpinnings
__label__0 rather  folkways direct appropriate behavior in the day  to  day practices and expressions of a culture
__label__0 in the united states  for example  the number thirteen is associated with bad luck
__label__0 in japan  however  the number four is considered unlucky  since it is pronounced similarly to the japanese word for  death
__label__0 the sapir  whorf hypothesis is based on the idea that people experience their world through their language  and that they therefore understand their world through the culture embedded in their language
__label__1 the hypothesis  which has also been called linguistic relativity  states that language shapes thought  swoyer
__label__0 subculture and counterculture
__label__1 a subculture is just what it sounds like  a smaller cultural group within a larger culture  people of a subculture are part of the larger culture but also share a specific identity within a smaller group
__label__0 hunter  gatherer societies demonstrate the strongest dependence on the environment of the various types of preindustrial societies
__label__0 as the basic structure of human society until about  years ago  these groups were based around kinship or tribes
__label__0 his primary concern was that the cultural glue that held society together was failing  and people were becoming more divided
__label__0 in his book the division of labor in society     durkheim argued that as society grew more complex  social order made the transition from mechanical to organic  preindustrial societies  durkheim explained  were held together by mechanical solidarity  a type of social order maintained by the collective consciousness of a culture
__label__0 societies with mechanical solidarity act in a mechanical fashion  things are done mostly because they have always been done that way
__label__0 additionally  marx saw conflict in society as the primary means of change
__label__1 economically  he saw conflict existing between the owners of the means of production  the bourgeoisie  and the laborers  called the proletariat
__label__0 marx maintained that these conflicts appeared consistently throughout history during times of social revolution
__label__0 another idea that marx developed is the concept of false consciousness
__label__1 false consciousness is a condition in which the beliefs  ideals  or ideology of a person are not in the person s own best interest
__label__0 the symbolic interactionism theory  the third of the three most recognized theories of sociology  is based on weber s early ideas that emphasize the viewpoint of the individual and how that individual relates to society
__label__1 for weber  the culmination of industrialization  rationalization  and the like results in what he referred to as the iron cage  in which the individual is trapped by institutions and bureaucracy
__label__1 this leads to a sense of  disenchantment of the world   a phrase weber used to describe the final condition of humanity
__label__0 another way of looking at this concept is through wi
__label__0 thomas s notable thomas theorem which states   if men define situations as real  they are real in their consequences   thomas and thomas
__label__0 that is  people s behavior can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality
__label__1 sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits that a person experiences according to their rank and role in society
__label__1 some statuses are ascribed  those you do not select  such as son  elderly person  or female
__label__0 all we can observe is behavior  or role performance
__label__1 role performance is how a person expresses his or her role
__label__0 sociologist erving goffman presented the idea that a person is like an actor on a stage
__label__0 and commuting times and distances have continued to increase as new suburbs developed farther and farther from city centers
__label__0 simultaneously  this dynamic contributed to an exponential increase in natural resource use  like petroleum  which sequentially increased pollution in the form of carbon emissions
__label__1 as the suburbs became more crowded and lost their charm  those who could afford it turned to the exurbs  communities that exist outside the ring of suburbs and are typically populated by even wealthier families who want more space and have the resources to lengthen their commute
__label__1 together  the suburbs  exurbs  and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis
__label__0 as the social policy  debate feature illustrates  the suburbs also have their share of socio  economic problems
__label__1 in the united states  white flight refers to the migration of economically secure white people from racially mixed urban areas and toward the suburbs
__label__0 this occurred throughout the twentieth century  due to causes as diverse as the legal end of racial segregation established by brown v board of education to the mariel boatlift of cubans fleeing cuba s mariel port for miami
__label__1 while you might be more familiar with the phrase  global warming   climate change is the term now used to refer to long  term shifts in temperatures due to human activity and  in particular  the release of greenhouse gases into the environment
__label__0 the planet as a whole is warming  but the term climate change acknowledges that the short  term variations in this process can include both higher and lower temperatures  despite the overarching trend toward warmth
__label__0 often  the stories are not newsmakers  but simply an unpleasant part of life for the people who live near toxic sites such as centralia  pennsylvania and hinkley  california
__label__0 in many cases  people in these neighborhoods can be part of a cancer cluster without realizing the cause
__label__0 where will people live
__label__1 to explore these questions  we turn to demography  or the study of populations
__label__1 three of the most important components that affect the issues above are fertility  mortality  and migration  the fertility rate of a society is a measure noting the number of children born
__label__1 changing fertility  mortality  and migration rates make up the total population composition  a snapshot of the demographic profile of a population
__label__0 this number can be measured for societies  nations  world regions  or other groups
__label__0 ehrlich s ideas suggest that the human population is moving rapidly toward complete environmental collapse  as privileged people use up or pollute a number of environmental resources such as water and air
__label__1 he advocated for a goal of zero population growth  zpg   in which the number of people entering a population through birth or immigration is equal to the number of people leaving it via death or emigration
__label__0 while support for this concept is mixed  it is still considered a possible solution to global overpopulation
__label__1 later  george herbert mead      studied the self  a person s distinct identity that is developed through social interaction
__label__0 in order to engage in this process of  self   an individual has to be able to view him or herself through the eyes of others
__label__0 most importantly  we have to learn language  whether it s the dominant language or one common in a subculture  whether it s verbal or through signs  in order to communicate and to think
__label__1 as we saw with danielle  without socialization we literally have no self  nature versus nurturesome experts assert that who we are is a result of nurture  the relationships and caring that surround us
__label__0 others argue that who we are is based entirely in genetics
__label__1 just as young children pretend to be doctors or lawyers  play house  and dress up  adults also engage in anticipatory socialization  the preparation for future life roles
__label__0 examples would include a couple who cohabitate before marriage or soon  to  be parents who read infant care books and prepare their home for the new arrival
__label__1 peer groupsa peer group is made up of people who are similar in age and social status and who share interests
__label__0 peer group socialization begins in the earliest years  such as when kids on a playground teach younger children the norms about taking turns  the rules of a game  or how to shoot a basket
__label__1 the term group is an amorphous one and can refer to a wide variety of gatherings  from just two people  think about a  group project  in school when you partner with another student   a club  a regular gathering of friends  or people who work together or share a hobby
__label__0 in short  the term refers to any collection of at least two people who interact with some frequency and who share a sense that their identity is somehow aligned with the group
__label__0 types of groups
__label__0 sociologist charles horton cooley      suggested that groups can broadly be divided into two categories  primary groups and secondary groups  cooley
__label__0 according to cooley  primary groups play the most critical role in our lives
__label__0 the feeling that we belong in an elite or select group is a heady one  while the feeling of not being allowed in  or of being in competition with a group  can be motivating in a different way
__label__0 sociologist william sumner      developed the concepts of in  group and out  group to explain this phenomenon  sumner
__label__1 in short  an in  group is the group that an individual feels she belongs to  and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is
__label__0 after all  how well could soldiers function in a battle if they had no idea whom to listen to or if different people were calling out orders
__label__1 other secondary groups  like a workplace or a classroom  also have formal leaders  but the styles and functions of leadership can vary significantly  leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader
__label__1 an instrumental leader is one who is goal  oriented and largely concerned with accomplishing set tasks
__label__0 former secretary of state hillary clinton s experiences provide an example of the way society reacts to a high  profile woman who is an instrumental leader
__label__0 despite the stereotype  boatwright and forrest    have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership
__label__0 in addition to these leadership functions  there are three different leadership styles
__label__1 democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making
__label__0 while this style can work well with highly motivated and mature participants who have clear goals and guidelines  it risks group dissolution and a lack of progress
__label__1 as the name suggests  authoritarian leaders issue orders and assigns tasks
__label__0 these leaders are clear instrumental leaders with a strong focus on meeting goals
__label__0 from schools to businesses to healthcare to government  these organizations  referred to as formal organizations  are highly bureaucratized
__label__0 indeed  all formal organizations are  or likely will become  bureaucracies
__label__1 a bureaucracy is an ideal type of formal organization
__label__0 these may include prison or a rehabilitation center
__label__0 symbolic interactionist erving goffman states that most coercive organizations are total institutions
__label__1 a total institution is one in which inmates or military soldiers live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place
__label__1 a clear division of labor refers to the fact that within a bureaucracy  each individual has a specialized task to perform
__label__0 for example  psychology professors teach psychology  but they do not attempt to provide students with financial aid forms
__label__0 this results in an impersonal organization
__label__0 customers frequently complain that stores like walmart care little about individuals  other businesses  and the community at large
__label__1 bureaucracies are  in theory at least  meritocracies  meaning that hiring and promotion is based on proven and documented skills  rather than on nepotism or random choice
__label__0 in order to get into a prestigious college  you need to perform well on the sat and have an impressive transcript
__label__0 and what is the relationship between deviance and crime
__label__1 according to sociologist william graham sumner  deviance is a violation of established contextual  cultural  or social norms  whether folkways  mores  or codified law
__label__0 it can be as minor as picking your nose in public or as major as committing murder
__label__0 think of social order as an employee handbook and social control as a manager
__label__0 when a worker violates a workplace guideline  the manager steps in to enforce the rules  when an employee is doing an exceptionally good job at following the rules  the manager may praise or promote the employee
__label__1 the means of enforcing rules are known as sanctions
__label__0 sanctions can be positive as well as negative
__label__0 although shoplifting  a form of social deviance  may be illegal  there are no laws dictating the proper way to scratch your nose
__label__0 that does nt mean picking your nose in public wo nt be punished  instead  you will encounter informal sanctions
__label__0 informal sanctions emerge in face  to  face social interactions
__label__1 developed by researchers at the university of chicago in the s and s  social disorganization theory asserts that crime is most likely to occur in communities with weak social ties and the absence of social control
__label__0 an individual who grows up in a poor neighborhood with high rates of drug use  violence  teenage delinquency  and deprived parenting is more likely to become a criminal than an individual from a wealthy neighborhood with a good school system and families who are involved positively in the community
__label__0 conflict theory was greatly influenced by the work of german philosopher  economist  and social scientist karl marx
__label__0 marx believed that the general population was divided into two groups
__label__0 sociologist edwin lemert expanded on the concepts of labeling theory and identified two types of deviance that affect identity formation
__label__1 primary deviance is a violation of norms that does not result in any long  term effects on the individual s self  image or interactions with others
__label__0 speeding is a deviant act  but receiving a speeding ticket generally does not make others view you as a bad person  nor does it alter your own self  concept
__label__0 since criminology was a young field  he drew on other aspects of sociology including social interactions and group learning  laub
__label__1 his conclusions established differential association theory  which suggested that individuals learn deviant behavior from those close to them who provide models of and opportunities for deviance
__label__0 according to sutherland  deviance is less a personal choice and more a result of differential socialization processes
__label__0 in modern us society  crimes are classified as one of two types based on their severity
__label__1 violent crimes  also known as  crimes against a person   are based on the use of force or the threat of force
__label__0 rape  murder  and armed robbery fall under this category
__label__1 when we think of crime  we often picture street crime  or offenses committed by ordinary people against other people or organizations  usually in public spaces
__label__1 an often overlooked category is corporate crime  or crime committed by white  collar workers in a business environment
__label__0 embezzlement  insider trading  and identity theft are all types of corporate crime
__label__0 due to these issues  the us bureau of justice statistics publishes a separate self  report study known as the national crime victimization report  ncvr
__label__1 a self  report study is a collection of data gathered using voluntary response methods  such as questionnaires or telephone interviews
__label__0 self  report data are gathered each year  asking approximately  people in the united states about the frequency and types of crime they ve experienced in their daily lives  bjs
__label__0 courtsonce a crime has been committed and a violator has been identified by the police  the case goes to court
__label__1 a court is a system that has the authority to make decisions based on law
__label__0 the us judicial system is divided into federal courts and state courts
__label__0 the first is differential class  based access to technology in the form of the digital divide
__label__1 this digital divide has led to the second form  a knowledge gap  which is  as it sounds  an ongoing and increasing gap in information for those who have less access to technology
__label__0 simply put  students in well  funded schools receive more exposure to technology than students in poorly funded schools
__label__0 according to the functionalist perspective  health is vital to the stability of the society  and therefore sickness is a sanctioned form of deviance
__label__0 talcott parsons    was the first to discuss this in terms of the sick role  patterns of expectations that define appropriate behavior for the sick and for those who take care of them
__label__1 as we discussed in the beginning of the chapter  interactionists focus on the specific meanings and causes people attribute to illness
__label__1 the term medicalization of deviance refers to the process that changes  bad  behavior into  sick  behavior
__label__1 a related process is demedicalization  in which  sick  behavior is normalized again
__label__0 unfortunately  the us census current population survey of  shows that  percent of people in the united states have no health insurance at all
__label__0 equally alarming  a study by the commonwealth fund shows that in    million adults were either uninsured or underinsured  that is  people who pay at least  percent of their income on healthcare costs not covered by insurance or  for low  income adults  those whose medical expenses or deductibles are at least  percent of their income  schoen  doty  robertson  and collins
__label__0 the commonwealth study further reports that while underinsurance has historically been an issue that low  income families faced  today it is affecting middle  income families more and more  why are so many people uninsured or underinsured
__label__0 the best example of socialized medicine is in great britain  where the national health system  nhs  gives free healthcare to all its residents
__label__0 and despite some us citizens  knee  jerk reaction to any healthcare changes that hint of socialism  the united states has one socialized system with the veterans health administration
__label__1 it is important to distinguish between socialized medicine  in which the government owns the healthcare system  and universal healthcare  which is simply a system that guarantees healthcare coverage for everyone
__label__0 germany  singapore  and canada all have universal healthcare
__label__0 marilyn winkleby and her research associates    state that  one of the strongest and most consistent predictors of a person s morbidity and mortality experience is that person s socioeconomic status  ses
__label__0 this finding persists across all diseases with few exceptions  continues throughout the entire lifespan  and extends across numerous risk factors for disease
__label__1 morbidity is the incidence of disease
__label__0 it is important to remember that economics are only part of the ses picture  research suggests that education also plays an important role
__label__0 phelan and link    note that many behavior  influenced diseases like lung cancer  from smoking   coronary artery disease  from poor eating and exercise habits   and aids initially were widespread across ses groups
__label__1 anxiety is a normal reaction to stress that we all feel at some point  but anxiety disorders are feelings of worry and fearfulness that last for months at a time
__label__0 anxiety disorders include obsessive compulsive disorder  ocd   panic disorders  posttraumatic stress disorder  ptsd   and both social and specific phobias
__label__0 the second most common mental disorders in the united states are mood disorders  roughly  percent of us adults are likely to be affected yearly  while  percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime  national institute of mental health
__label__0 major mood disorders are depression  bipolar disorder  and dysthymic disorder
__label__0 the world health organization makes a distinction between the various terms used to describe handicaps that s important to the sociological perspective
__label__1 they use the term impairment to describe the physical limitations  while reserving the term disability to refer to the social limitation
__label__0 before the passage of the americans with disabilities act  ada  in   people in the united states with disabilities were often excluded from opportunities and social institutions many of us take for granted
__label__1 social epidemiology is the study of the causes and distribution of diseases
__label__0 social epidemiology can reveal how social problems are connected to the health of different populations
__label__0 the stigma may keep people from seeking help for their illness  making it worse than it needs to be
__label__1 contested illnesses are those that are questioned or questionable by some medical professionals
__label__0 disorders like fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome may be either true illnesses or only in the patients  heads  depending on the opinion of the medical professional
__label__0 these are granted for the invention or discovery of any new and useful process  product  or machine  or for a significant improvement to existing technologies
__label__0 the second type of patent is a design patent
__label__1 commonly conferred in architecture and industrial design  this means someone has invented a new and original design for a manufactured product
__label__1 new media encompasses all interactive forms of information exchange
__label__0 these include social networking sites  blogs  podcasts  wikis  and virtual worlds
__label__0 but the numbers are misleading
__label__1 media consolidation is a process in which fewer and fewer owners control the majority of media outlets
__label__1 this creates an oligopoly in which a few firms dominate the media marketplace
__label__0 such a fast  paced dynamic is not always to our benefit
__label__1 some sociologists assert that this level of media exposure leads to narcotizing dysfunction  a result in which people are too overwhelmed with media input to really care about the issue  so their involvement becomes defined by awareness instead of by action  lazerfeld and merton
__label__1 increasingly prominent in the discussion of new media and feminism is cyberfeminism  the application to  and promotion of  feminism online
__label__0 research on cyberfeminism runs the gamut from the liberating use of blogs by women living in iraq during the second gulf war  peirce   to an investigation of the suicide girls web site  magnet
__label__0 geography  race  gender  and other factors have always played a role in the reality of success
__label__1 more recently  the increased outsourcing  or contracting a job or set of jobs to an outside source  of manufacturing jobs to developing nations has greatly diminished the number of high  paying  often unionized  blue  collar positions available
__label__1 in short  collective behavior is any group behavior that is not mandated or regulated by an institution
__label__0 there are three primary forms of collective behavior  the crowd  the mass  and the public
__label__0 it takes a fairly large number of people in close proximity to form a crowd  lofland
__label__0 examples include a group of people attending an ani difranco concert  tailgating at a patriots game  or attending a worship service
__label__1 conventional crowds are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly  like a religious service
__label__1 expressive crowds are people who join together to express emotion  often at funerals  weddings  or the like
__label__1 the final type  acting crowds  focuses on a specific goal or action  such as a protest movement or riot  in addition to the different types of crowds  collective groups can also be identified in two other ways
__label__0 sociologist david aberle    addresses this question by developing categories that distinguish among social movements based on what they want to change and how much change they want
__label__1 reform movements seek to change something specific about the social structure
__label__0 examples include antinuclear groups  mothers against drunk driving  madd   the dreamers movement for immigration reform  and the human rights campaign s advocacy for marriage equality
__label__0 resource mobilization and the civil rights movementan example of resource mobilization theory is activity of the civil rights movement in the decade between the mid s and the mid s
__label__0 social movements had existed before  notably the women s suffrage movement and a long line of labor movements  thus constituting an existing social movement sector  which is the multiple social movement industries in a society  even if they have widely varying constituents and goals
__label__0 the civil rights movement had also existed well before rosa parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man
__label__1 the anti  gay marriage movement is an example of diagnostic framing with its uncompromising insistence that marriage is only between a man and a woman
__label__1 prognostic framing  the second type  offers a solution and states how it will be implemented
__label__0 some examples of this frame  when looking at the issue of marriage equality as framed by the anti  gay marriage movement  include the plan to restrict marriage to  one man  one woman  or to allow only  civil unions  instead of marriages
__label__1 new social movement theory  a development of european social scientists in the s and s  attempts to explain the proliferation of postindustrial and postmodern movements that are difficult to analyze using traditional social movement theories
__label__0 rather than being one specific theory  it is more of a perspective that revolves around understanding movements as they relate to politics  identity  culture  and social change
__label__1 modernization describes the processes that increase the amount of specialization and differentiation of structure in societies resulting in the move from an undeveloped society to a developed  technologically driven society  irwin
__label__0 by this definition  the level of modernity within a society is judged by the sophistication of its technology  particularly as it relates to infrastructure  industry  and the like
__label__1 sociologists study all aspects and levels of society
__label__0 sociologists working from the micro  level study small groups and individual interactions  while those using macro  level analysis look at trends among and between large groups and societies
__label__0 for example  a micro  level study might look at the accepted rules of conversation in various groups such as among teenagers or business professionals
__label__1 remember  though  that culture is a product of the people in a society  sociologists take care not to treat the concept of  culture  as though it were alive in its own right
__label__1 reification is an error of treating an abstract concept as though it has a real  material existence  sahn
__label__1 in seeking verstehen  outside observers of a social world  an entire culture or a small setting  attempt to understand it from an insider s point of view  in his book the nature of social action     weber described sociology as striving to
__label__1 he and other like  minded sociologists proposed a philosophy of antipositivism whereby social researchers would strive for subjectivity as they worked to represent social processes  cultural norms  and societal values
__label__0 this approach led to some research methods whose aim was not to generalize or predict  traditional in science   but to systematically gain an in  depth understanding of social worlds
__label__1 sociologists study social events  interactions  and patterns  and they develop a theory in an attempt to explain why things work as they do
__label__1 in sociology  a theory is a way to explain different aspects of social interactions and to create a testable proposition  called a hypothesis  about society  allan
__label__1 in sociology  a theory is a way to explain different aspects of social interactions and to create a testable proposition  called a hypothesis  about society  allan
__label__0 classic sociological theories are still considered important and current  but new sociological theories build upon the work of their predecessors and add to them  calhoun
__label__1 in sociology  a few theories provide broad perspectives that help explain many different aspects of social life  and these are called paradigms
__label__0 paradigms are philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within a discipline to formulate theories  generalizations  and the experiments performed in support of them
__label__0 three paradigms have come to dominate sociological thinking  because they provide useful explanations  structural functionalism  conflict theory  and symbolic interactionism
__label__0 he believed that to study society  a sociologist must look beyond individuals to social facts such as laws  morals  values  religious beliefs  customs  fashion  and rituals  which all serve to govern social life
__label__0 alfred radcliffe  brown      defined the function of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as a whole  and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity  radcliffe  brown
__label__1 in a healthy society  all parts work together to maintain stability  a state called dynamic equilibrium by later sociologists such as parsons
__label__0 another noted structural functionalist  robert merton       pointed out that social processes often have many functions
__label__1 manifest functions are the consequences of a social process that are sought or anticipated  while latent functions are the unsought consequences of a social process
__label__0 a manifest function of college education  for example  includes gaining knowledge  preparing for a career  and finding a good job that utilizes that education
__label__0 conflict theory has been criticized because it tends to focus on conflict to the exclusion of recognizing stability
__label__0 many social structures are extremely stable or have gradually progressed over time rather than changing abruptly as conflict theory would suggest
__label__0 symbolic interactionist theory
__label__1 symbolic interactionism is a micro  level theory that focuses on the relationships among individuals within a society
__label__1 communication  the exchange of meaning through language and symbols  is believed to be the way in which people make sense of their social worlds
__label__0 sociological research attempts to answer a vast variety of questions  such as these and more  about our social world  we often have opinions about social situations  but these may be biased by our expectations or based on limited data
__label__1 instead  scientific research is based on empirical evidence  which is evidence that comes from direct experience  scientifically gathered data  or experimentation
__label__1 instead  scientific research is based on empirical evidence  which is evidence that comes from direct experience  scientifically gathered data  or experimentation
__label__0 many people believe  for example  that crime rates go up when there s a full moon  but research does nt support this opinion
__label__1 a hypothesis is a testable educated guess about predicted outcomes between two or more variables  it s a possible explanation for specific happenings in the social world and allows for testing to determine whether the explanation holds true in many instances  as well as among various groups or in different places
__label__0 sociologists use empirical data and the scientific method  or an interpretative framework  to increase understanding of societies and social interactions  but research begins with the search for an answer to a question
__label__0 sociologists do not rule out any topic  but would strive to frame these questions in better research terms
__label__0 that is why sociologists are careful to define their terms
__label__1 in a hygiene study  for instance  hygiene could be defined as  personal habits to maintain physical appearance  as opposed to health    and a researcher might ask   how do differing personal hygiene habits reflect the cultural value placed on appearance
__label__1 when forming these basic research questions  sociologists develop an operational definition  that is  they define the concept in terms of the physical or concrete steps it takes to objectively measure it
__label__0 the operational definition identifies an observable condition of the concept
__label__0 in sociology  the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another
__label__1 in research  independent variables are the cause of the change
__label__1 the dependent variable is the effect  or thing that is changed
__label__0 a researcher would nt stroll into a crime  ridden neighborhood at midnight  calling out   any gang members around
__label__0 and if a researcher walked into a coffee shop and told the employees they would be observed as part of a study on work efficiency  the self  conscious  intimidated baristas might not behave naturally
__label__1 this is called the hawthorne effect  where people change their behavior because they know they are being watched as part of a study
__label__0 the hawthorne effect is unavoidable in some research
__label__0 surveys can track preferences for presidential candidates or reported individual behaviors  such as sleeping  driving  or texting habits  or factual information such as employment status  income  and education levels
__label__1 a survey targets a specific population  people who are the focus of a study  such as college athletes  international students  or teenagers living with type   juvenile  onset  diabetes
__label__1 most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population  or a sample  that is  a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population
__label__0 for some topics  the researcher might ask yes  or  no or multiple  choice questions  allowing subjects to choose possible responses to each question
__label__1 this kind of quantitative data  research collected in numerical form that can be counted  are easy to tabulate
__label__0 just count up the number of  yes  and  no  responses or correct answers  and chart them into percentages
__label__0 questionnaires can also ask more complex questions with more complex answers  beyond  yes    no   or the option next to a checkbox
__label__0 they meet subjects where they live  work  and play
__label__1 field research refers to gathering primary data from a natural environment without doing a lab experiment or a survey
__label__0 it is a research method suited to an interpretive framework rather than to the scientific method
__label__1 ethnography is the extended observation of the social perspective and cultural values of an entire social setting
__label__0 ethnographies involve objective observation of an entire community
__label__0 while sociologists often engage in original research studies  they also contribute knowledge to the discipline through secondary data analysis
__label__1 secondary data does nt result from firsthand research collected from primary sources  but are the already completed work of other researchers
__label__0 the asa is a great resource for students of sociology as well
__label__1 the asa maintains a code of ethics  formal guidelines for conducting sociological research  consisting of principles and ethical standards to be used in the discipline
__label__1 the asa maintains a code of ethics  formal guidelines for conducting sociological research  consisting of principles and ethical standards to be used in the discipline
__label__0 it also describes procedures for filing  investigating  and resolving complaints of unethical conduct
__label__0 in everyday conversation  people rarely distinguish between the terms culture and society  but the terms have slightly different meanings  and the distinction is important to a sociologist
__label__1 a society describes a group of people who share a community and a culture
__label__1 by  community   sociologists refer to a definable region  as small as a neighborhood  brooklyn  or  the east side of town    as large as a country  ethiopia  the united states  or nepal   or somewhere in between  in the united states  this might include someone who identifies with southern or midwestern society
__label__1 cultural imperialism  the deliberate imposition of one s own cultural values on another culture
__label__0 europe s colonial expansion  begun in the sixteenth century  was often accompanied by a severe cultural imperialism
__label__0 values often suggest how people should behave  but they do nt accurately reflect how people do behave
__label__1 values portray an ideal culture  the standards society would like to embrace and live up to
__label__0 but ideal culture differs from real culture  the way society actually is  based on what occurs and exists
__label__0 people sanction certain behaviors by giving their support  approval  or permission  or by instilling formal actions of disapproval and nonsupport
__label__1 sanctions are a form of social control  a way to encourage conformity to cultural norms
__label__0 sometimes people conform to norms in anticipation or expectation of positive sanctions  good grades  for instance  may mean praise from parents and teachers
__label__1 there are plenty of formal norms  but the list of informal norms  casual behaviors that are generally and widely conformed to  is longer
__label__0 people learn informal norms by observation  imitation  and general socialization
__label__0 humans  consciously and subconsciously  are always striving to make sense of their surrounding world
__label__0 symbols  such as gestures  signs  objects  signals  and words  help people understand that world
__label__1 they provide clues to understanding experiences by conveying recognizable meanings that are shared by societies
__label__0 in each pair  one type of entertainment is considered high  brow and the other low  brow
__label__1 sociologists use the term high culture to describe the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in the highest class segments of a society
__label__0 people often associate high culture with intellectualism  political power  and prestige
__label__1 sociologists distinguish subcultures from countercultures  which are a type of subculture that rejects some of the larger culture s norms and values
__label__0 in contrast to subcultures  which operate relatively smoothly within the larger society  countercultures might actively defy larger society by developing their own set of rules and norms to live by  sometimes even creating communities that operate outside of greater society
__label__1 inventions result when something new is formed from existing objects or concepts  when things are put together in an entirely new manner
__label__0 in the late s and early s  electric appliances were invented at an astonishing pace
__label__0 today  many us companies set up offices in other nations where the costs of resources and labor are cheaper
__label__1 when a person in the united states calls to get information about banking  insurance  or computer services  the person taking that call may be working in another country  alongside the process of globalization is diffusion  or the spread of material and nonmaterial culture
__label__1 while globalization refers to the integration of markets  diffusion relates to a similar process in the integration of international cultures
__label__0 roughly  years ago  human societies began to recognize their ability to tame and breed animals and to grow and cultivate their own plants
__label__1 pastoral societies  such as the maasai villagers  rely on the domestication of animals as a resource for survival
__label__1 unlike earlier hunter  gatherers who depended entirely on existing resources to stay alive  pastoral groups were able to breed livestock for food  clothing  and transportation  and they created a surplus of goods
__label__0 the ninth century gave rise to feudal societies
__label__1 these societies contained a strict hierarchical system of power based around land ownership and protection
__label__0 he asserted that individual behavior was not the same as collective behavior and that studying collective behavior was quite different from studying an individual s actions
__label__1 durkheim called the communal beliefs  morals  and attitudes of a society the collective conscience
__label__0 in his quest to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways  he wrote   if i do not submit to the conventions of society  if in my dress i do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in my class  the ridicule i provoke  the social isolation in which i am kept  produce  although in an attenuated form  the same effects as punishment   durkheim
__label__0 this type of thinking was common in preindustrial societies where strong bonds of kinship and a low division of labor created shared morals and values among people  such as hunter  gatherer groups
__label__0 when people tend to do the same type of work  durkheim argued  they tend to think and act alike
__label__1 in industrial societies  mechanical solidarity is replaced with organic solidarity  which is social order based around an acceptance of economic and social differences
__label__0 in capitalist societies  durkheim wrote  division of labor becomes so specialized that everyone is doing different things
__label__0 marx s colleague and friend  frederick engels  wrote the condition of the working  class in england in   which described in detail the horrid conditions  such is the old town of manchester  and on re  reading my description  i am forced to admit that instead of being exaggerated  it is far from black enough to convey a true impression of the filth  ruin  and uninhabitableness  the defiance of all considerations of cleanliness  ventilation  and health which characterise the construction of this single district  containing at least twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants
__label__0 and such a district exists in the heart of the second city of england  the first manufacturing city of the world
__label__1 add to that the long hours  the use of child labor  and exposure to extreme conditions of heat  cold  and toxic chemicals  and it is no wonder that marx and engels referred to capitalism  which is a way of organizing an economy so that the things that are used to make and transport products  such as land  oil  factories  ships  etc
__label__0 are owned by individual people and companies rather than by the government  as the  dictatorship of the bourgeoisie
__label__0 karl marx  left  and friedrich engels  right  analyzed differences in social power between  have  and  have  not  groups
__label__1 in order for society to overcome false consciousness  marx proposed that it be replaced with class consciousness  the awareness of one s rank in society
__label__1 instead of existing as a  class in itself   the proletariat must become a  class for itself  in order to produce social change  marx and engels    meaning that instead of just being an inert strata of society  the class could become an advocate for social improvements
__label__0 in  sociologists peter berger and thomas luckmann wrote a book called the social construction of reality
__label__0 in it  they argued that society is created by humans and human interaction  which they call habitualization
__label__1 habitualization describes how  any action that is repeated frequently becomes cast into a pattern  which can then be  performed again in the future in the same manner and with the same economical effort   berger and luckmann
__label__0 that is  people s behavior can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality
__label__0 for example  a teenager who is repeatedly given a label  overachiever  player  bum  might live up to the term even though it initially was nt a part of his character  like berger and luckmann in their description of habitualization  thomas states that our moral codes and social norms are created by  successive definitions of the situation
__label__0 this concept is defined by sociologist robert k merton as a self  fulfilling prophecy
__label__0 merton explains that with a self  fulfilling prophecy  even a false idea can become true if it is acted upon
__label__1 sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits that a person experiences according to their rank and role in society
__label__1 some statuses are ascribed  those you do not select  such as son  elderly person  or female
__label__1 others  called achieved statuses  are obtained by choice  such as a high school dropout  self  made millionaire  or nurse
__label__0 even a single status such as  student  has a complex role  set  or array of roles  attached to it  merton
__label__1 if too much is required of a single role  individuals can experience role strain
__label__0 consider the duties of a parent  cooking  cleaning  driving  problem  solving  acting as a source of moral guidance  the list goes on
__label__0 goffman s dramaturgy ideas expand on the ideas of charles cooley and the looking  glass self
__label__0 according to cooley  we base our image on what we think other people see  cooley
__label__1 a refugee is defined as an individual who has been forced to leave his or her country in order to escape war  persecution  or natural disaster  while asylum  seekers are those whose claim to refugee status has not been validated
__label__1 an internally displaced person  on the other hand  is neither a refugee nor an asylum  seeker
__label__1 displaced persons have fled their homes while remaining inside their country s borders
__label__0 simultaneously  this dynamic contributed to an exponential increase in natural resource use  like petroleum  which sequentially increased pollution in the form of carbon emissions
__label__0 as the suburbs became more crowded and lost their charm  those who could afford it turned to the exurbs  communities that exist outside the ring of suburbs and are typically populated by even wealthier families who want more space and have the resources to lengthen their commute
__label__1 together  the suburbs  exurbs  and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis
__label__1 new york was the first us megalopolis  a huge urban corridor encompassing multiple cities and their surrounding suburbs
__label__0 as cities evolve from manufacturing  based industrial to service and information  based postindustrial societies  gentrification becomes more common
__label__1 gentrification occurs when members of the middle and upper classes enter and renovate city areas that have been historically less affluent while the poor urban underclass are forced by resulting price pressures to leave those neighborhoods for increasingly decaying portions of the city
__label__0 globally   percent of the world s  billion people currently reside in urban areas  with the most urbanized region being north america   percent   followed by latin america  the caribbean   percent   with europe coming in third   percent
__label__0 the challenge for a human ecologist working in us urban planning is to design landscapes and waterscapes with natural beauty  while also figuring out how to provide for free  flowing transport of innumerable vehicles  not to mention parking
__label__0 the concentric zone model  burgess   is perhaps the most famous example of human ecology
__label__1 this model views a city as a series of concentric circular areas  expanding outward from the center of the city  with various  zones  invading adjacent zones  as new categories of people and businesses overrun the edges of nearby zones  and succeeding  then after invasion  the new inhabitants repurpose the areas they have invaded and push out the previous inhabitants
__label__0 the gcci is a united states agency for international development  usaid  funding program intended to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of peripheral and semi  peripheral countries by encouraging the use of alternative  low  carbon  energy sources with financial incentives
__label__1 the gcci is a united states agency for international development  usaid  funding program intended to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of peripheral and semi  peripheral countries by encouraging the use of alternative  low  carbon  energy sources with financial incentives
__label__1 programming is organized around three pillars     climate change adaptation     clean energy  and    sustainable landscapes  troilo
__label__0 pollution
__label__1 pollution describes what happens when contaminants are introduced into an environment  water  air  land  at levels that are damaging
__label__0 environments can often sustain a limited amount of contaminants without marked change  and water  air  and soil can  heal  themselves to a certain degree
__label__1 environmental racism refers to the way in which minority group neighborhoods  populated primarily by people of color and members of low socioeconomic groups  are burdened with a disproportionate number of hazards  including toxic waste facilities  garbage dumps  and other sources of environmental pollution and foul odors that lower the quality of life
__label__0 all around the globe  members of minority groups bear a greater burden of the health problems that result from higher exposure to waste and pollution
__label__1 to explore these questions  we turn to demography  or the study of populations
__label__1 three of the most important components that affect the issues above are fertility  mortality  and migration  the fertility rate of a society is a measure noting the number of children born
__label__1 the fertility number is generally lower than the fecundity number  which measures the potential number of children that could be born to women of childbearing age
__label__0 this number can be measured for societies  nations  world regions  or other groups
__label__1 the population composition includes the sex ratio  the number of men for every hundred women  as well as the population pyramid  a picture of population distribution by sex and age   linkthis population pyramid shows the breakdown of the  us population according to age and sex
__label__0 graph courtesy of econ proph blog and the us census bureau
__label__0 of course  some theories are less focused on the pessimistic hypothesis that the world s population will meet a detrimental challenge to sustaining itself
__label__1 cornucopian theory scoffs at the idea of humans wiping themselves out  it asserts that human ingenuity can resolve any environmental or social issues that develop
__label__0 as an example  it points to the issue of food supply
__label__0 they learn to understand interactions involving different people with a variety of purposes
__label__0 for example  a child at this stage is likely to be aware of the different responsibilities of people in a restaurant who together make for a smooth dining experience  someone seats you  another takes your order  someone else cooks the food  while yet another clears away dirty dishes
__label__0 finally  children develop  understand  and learn the idea of the generalized other  the common behavioral expectations of general society
__label__1 by this stage of development  an individual is able to imagine how he or she is viewed by one or many others  and thus  from a sociological perspective  to have a  self   mead   mead
__label__0 kohlberg s theory of moral development
__label__0 according to this belief  our temperaments  interests  and talents are set before birth
__label__0 from this perspective  then  who we are depends on nature
__label__1 in the process of resocialization  old behaviors that were helpful in a previous role are removed because they are no longer of use
__label__0 resocialization is necessary when a person moves to a senior care center  goes to boarding school  or serves time in jail
__label__1 school and classroom rituals  led by teachers serving as role models and leaders  regularly reinforce what society expects from children
__label__1 sociologists describe this aspect of schools as the hidden curriculum  the informal teaching done by schools
__label__0 a rally is usually a one  time event  for instance  and belonging to a political party does nt imply interaction with others
__label__1 people who exist in the same place at the same time but who do not interact or share a sense of identity  such as a bunch of people standing in line at starbucks  are considered an aggregate  or a crowd
__label__0 another example of a nongroup is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way
__label__1 the primary group is usually fairly small and is made up of individuals who generally engage face  to  face in long  term emotional ways
__label__0 this group serves emotional needs  expressive functions rather than pragmatic ones
__label__0 the primary group is usually made up of significant others  those individuals who have the most impact on our socialization
__label__1 a reference group is a group that people compare themselves to  it provides a standard of measurement
__label__0 in us society  peer groups are common reference groups
__label__0 other secondary groups  like a workplace or a classroom  also have formal leaders  but the styles and functions of leadership can vary significantly
__label__1 leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader
__label__1 an instrumental leader is one who is goal  oriented and largely concerned with accomplishing set tasks
__label__0 we can imagine that an army general or a fortune  ceo would be an instrumental leader
__label__0 despite the stereotype  boatwright and forrest    have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership  in addition to these leadership functions  there are three different leadership styles
__label__1 democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making
__label__0 they work hard to build consensus before choosing a course of action and moving forward
__label__0 she would nt want people to think she was too poor to find proper clothes
__label__1 conformity is the extent to which an individual complies with group norms or expectations
__label__0 as you might recall  we use reference groups to assess and understand how to act  to dress  and to behave
__label__0 sociologist amitai etzioni    posited that formal organizations fall into three categories
__label__1 normative organizations  also called voluntary organizations  are based on shared interests
__label__0 as the name suggests  joining them is voluntary and typically done because people find membership rewarding in an intangible way
__label__1 a total institution is one in which inmates or military soldiers live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place
__label__1 the third type is utilitarian organizations  which  as the name suggests  are joined because of the need for a specific material reward
__label__0 high school and the workplace fall into this category  one joined in pursuit of a diploma  the other in order to make money
__label__1 the existence of explicit rules refers to the way in which rules are outlined  written down  and standardized
__label__0 for example  at your college or university  the student guidelines are contained within the student handbook
__label__0 while ostensibly based on meritocracy  bureaucracies can perpetuate the existing balance of power by only recognizing the merit in traditionally male and privileged paths
__label__1 michels    suggested that all large organizations are characterized by the iron rule of oligarchy  wherein an entire organization is ruled by a few elites
__label__0 do you think this is true
__label__0 an adult belching loudly is avoided
__label__1 all societies practice social control  the regulation and enforcement of norms
__label__1 the underlying goal of social control is to maintain social order  an arrangement of practices and behaviors on which society s members base their daily lives
__label__0 sanctions can be positive as well as negative
__label__1 positive sanctions are rewards given for conforming to norms
__label__0 a promotion at work is a positive sanction for working hard
__label__0 informal sanctions emerge in face  to  face social interactions
__label__0 for example  wearing flip  flops to an opera or swearing loudly in church may draw disapproving looks or even verbal reprimands  whereas behavior that is seen as positive  such as helping an old man carry grocery bags across the street  may receive positive informal reactions  such as a smile or pat on the back
__label__1 formal sanctions  on the other hand  are ways to officially recognize and enforce norm violations
__label__0 if a student violates her college s code of conduct  for example  she might be expelled
__label__1 cultural deviance theory suggests that conformity to the prevailing cultural norms of lower  class society causes crime
__label__0 researchers clifford shaw and henry mckay    studied crime patterns in chicago in the early s
__label__1 in his book the power elite     sociologist c wright mills described the existence of what he dubbed the power elite  a small group of wealthy and influential people at the top of society who hold the power and resources
__label__0 wealthy executives  politicians  celebrities  and military leaders often have access to national and international power  and in some cases  their decisions affect everyone in society
__label__0 individuals who engage in primary deviance still maintain a feeling of belonging in society and are likely to continue to conform to norms in the future  sometimes  in more extreme cases  primary deviance can morph into secondary deviance
__label__1 secondary deviance occurs when a person s self  concept and behavior begin to change after his or her actions are labeled as deviant by members of society
__label__0 the person may begin to take on and fulfill the role of a  deviant  as an act of rebellion against the society that has labeled that individual as such
__label__1 although deviance is a violation of social norms  it s not always punishable  and it s not necessarily bad
__label__1 crime  on the other hand  is a behavior that violates official law and is punishable through formal sanctions
__label__0 walking to class backward is a deviant behavior
__label__0 rape  murder  and armed robbery fall under this category
__label__1 nonviolent crimes involve the destruction or theft of property but do not use force or the threat of force
__label__0 because of this  they are also sometimes called  property crimes   larceny  car theft  and vandalism are all types of nonviolent crimes
__label__0 although these types of offenses rarely receive the same amount of media coverage as street crimes  they can be far more damaging
__label__0 financial frauds such as insurance scams  ponzi schemes  and improper practices by banks can devastate families who lose their savings or home  an often  debated third type of crime is victimless crime
__label__1 crimes are called victimless when the perpetrator is not explicitly harming another person
__label__1 the us criminal justice systema criminal justice system is an organization that exists to enforce a legal code
__label__0 there are three branches of the us criminal justice system  the police  the courts  and the corrections system
__label__1 the corrections system  more commonly known as the prison system  is charged with supervising individuals who have been arrested  convicted  and sentenced for a criminal offense
__label__0 at the end of   approximately seven million us men and women were behind bars  bjs d
__label__0 those students with more exposure gain more proficiency  which makes them far more marketable in an increasingly technology  based job market and leaves our society divided into those with technological knowledge and those without
__label__1 even as we improve access  we have failed to address an increasingly evident gap in e  readiness  the ability to sort through  interpret  and process knowledge  sciadas since the beginning of the millennium  social science researchers have tried to bring attention to the digital divide  the uneven access to technology among different races  classes  and geographic areas
__label__0 the term became part of the common lexicon in   when then vice president al gore used it in a speech
__label__0 however  this exemption is temporary and relative to the severity of the illness
__label__0 the exemption also requires legitimation by a physician  that is  a physician must certify that the illness is genuine
__label__1 the term medicalization of deviance refers to the process that changes  bad  behavior into  sick  behavior
__label__1 a related process is demedicalization  in which  sick  behavior is normalized again
__label__0 medicalization and demedicalization affect who responds to the patient  how people respond to the patient  and how people view the personal responsibility of the patient  conrad and schneider
__label__0 it expands eligibility to programs like medicaid and chip  helps guarantee insurance coverage for people with pre  existing conditions  and establishes regulations to make sure that the premium funds collected by insurers and care providers go directly to medical care
__label__0 it also includes an individual mandate  which requires everyone to have insurance coverage by  or pay a penalty
__label__0 a series of provisions  including significant subsidies  are intended to address the discrepancies in income that are currently contributing to high rates of uninsurance and underinsurance
__label__0 again  the lowest  income countries  especially in the african region  experience the worst problems with disease
__label__1 an important component of disease prevention and control is epidemiology  or the study of the incidence  distribution  and possible control of diseases
__label__0 fear of ebola contamination  primarily in western africa but also to a smaller degree in the united states  became national news in the summer and fall of summary
__label__0 she further decries the pejorative connotation of the diagnosis  saying that it predisposes many people  both within and outside of the profession of psychotherapy  against women who have been so diagnosed  becker
__label__0 many critics also point to the medicalization of women s issues as an example of institutionalized sexism
__label__1 medicalization refers to the process by which previously normal aspects of life are redefined as deviant and needing medical attention to remedy
__label__0 historically and contemporaneously  many aspects of women s lives have been medicalized  including menstruation  pre  menstrual syndrome  pregnancy  childbirth  and menopause
__label__1 and bipolar disorder is characterized by dramatic shifts in energy and mood  often affecting the individual s ability to carry out day  to  day tasks
__label__0 bipolar disorder used to be called manic depression because of the way people would swing between manic and depressive episodes  depending on what definition is used  there is some overlap between mood disorders and personality disorders  which affect  percent of people in the united states yearly
__label__0 the american psychological association publishes the diagnostic and statistical manual on mental disorders  dsm   and their definition of personality disorders is changing in the fifth edition  which is being revised in  and
__label__0 ramps on sidewalks  braille instructions  and more accessible door levers are all accommodations to help people with disabilities  people with disabilities can be stigmatized by their illnesses
__label__1 stigmatization means their identity is spoiled  they are labeled as different  discriminated against  and sometimes even shunned
__label__0 they are labeled  as an interactionist might point out  and ascribed a master status  as a functionalist might note   becoming  the blind girl  or  the boy in the wheelchair  instead of someone afforded a full identity by society
__label__1 if sociology is the systematic study of human behavior in society  medical sociology is the systematic study of how humans manage issues of health and illness  disease and disorders  and healthcare for both the sick and the healthy
__label__1 medical sociologists study the physical  mental  and social components of health and illness
__label__0 technology and the media are interwoven  and neither can be separated from contemporary society in most core and semi  peripheral nations
__label__1 media is a term that refers to all print  digital  and electronic means of communication
__label__0 from the time the printing press was created  and even before   technology has influenced how and where information is shared
__label__0 commonly conferred in architecture and industrial design  this means someone has invented a new and original design for a manufactured product
__label__1 plant patents  the final type  recognize the discovery of new plant types that can be asexually reproduced
__label__0 while genetically modified food is the hot  button issue within this category  farmers have long been creating new hybrids and patenting them
__label__0 and appliance repair people say that while they might be fixing some machines that are twenty years old  they generally are nt fixing those that are seven years old  newer models are built to be thrown out
__label__1 this strategy is called planned obsolescence  and it is the business practice of planning for a product to be obsolete or unusable from the time it is created
__label__0 to some extent  planned obsolescence is a natural extension of new and emerging technologies
__label__1 media consolidation is a process in which fewer and fewer owners control the majority of media outlets
__label__0 this creates an oligopoly in which a few firms dominate the media marketplace
__label__0 in   a mere  corporations owned the bulk of mass  media outlets
__label__0 powerful individuals and social institutions have a great deal of influence over which forms of technology are released  when and where they are released  and what kind of media is available for our consumption  which is a form of gatekeeping
__label__1 shoemaker and vos    define gatekeeping as the sorting process by which thousands of possible messages are shaped into a mass media  appropriate form and reduced to a manageable amount
__label__0 in other words  the people in charge of the media decide what the public is exposed to  which  as c wright mills    famously noted  is the heart of media s power
__label__0 the kind of computer you own  the kind of car you drive  your ability to afford the latest apple product  these serve as a social indicator of wealth and status
__label__1 neo  luddites are people who see technology as symbolizing the coldness and alienation of modern life
__label__1 but for technophiles  technology symbolizes the potential for a brighter future
__label__0 the number of supervisory and managerial positions has been reduced as companies streamline their command structures and industries continue to consolidate through mergers
__label__0 even highly educated skilled workers such as computer programmers have seen their jobs vanish overseas  the automation of the workplace  which replaces workers with technology  is another cause of the changes in the job market
__label__0 these thinkers believed that ideas and social constructs must be proven to work before they could be accepted
__label__1 philosopher william james was one of the key proponents of the closely related concept of pragmatism  which held that americans needed to experiment with different ideas and perspectives to find the truth about american society  rather than assuming that there was truth in old  previously accepted models
__label__0 only by tying ideas  thoughts  and statements to actual objects and occurrences could one begin to identify a coherent truth  according to james
__label__0 two powerful republican leaders attempted to control the president
__label__1 the first was roscoe conkling  republican senator from new york and leader of the stalwarts  a group that strongly supported continuation of the current spoils system   link
__label__0 long supporting former president grant  conkling had no sympathy for some of hayes  early appeals for civil service reform
__label__0 unable to find such a man  the predominant half  breeds again turned to their own leader  senator blaine
__label__0 however  when news of his many personal corrupt bargains began to surface  a significant portion of the party chose to break from the traditional stalwarts  versus  half  breeds debate and form their own faction  the mugwumps  a name taken from the algonquin phrase for  great chief
__label__1 the farmers  alliance  a conglomeration of three regional alliances formed in the mid s  took root in the wake of the grange movement
__label__1 in   dr charles macune  who led the southern alliance  which was based in texas and had over  members by   urged the creation of a national alliance between his organization  the northwest alliance  and the colored alliance  the largest african american organization in the united states
__label__0 a notable example of the government s failure to act was the story of coxey s army
__label__1 in the spring of   businessman jacob coxey led a march of unemployed ohioans from cincinnati to washington  dc  where leaders of the group urged congress to pass public works legislation for the federal government to hire unemployed workers to build roads and other public projects
__label__0 it was not until theodore roosevelt unexpectedly became president in  that the federal government would engage in progressive reforms
__label__0 before then  progressivism was work done by the people  for the people
__label__0 what knit progressives together was the feeling that the country was moving at a dangerous pace in a dangerous direction and required the efforts of everyday americans to help put it back on track
__label__0 another series of reforms pushed forward by progressives that sought to sidestep the power of special interests in state legislatures and restore the democratic political process were three election innovations  the initiative  referendum  and recall
__label__1 the first permitted voters to enact legislation by petitioning to place an idea  or initiative  on the ballot
__label__0 the image below   link   shows a machinist in a factory where taylor had consulted  he is alone and focused solely on his job
__label__1 progressive in its emphasis on efficiency  the use of science  and the reliance on experts  taylorism  as scientific management became known  was not widely popular among workers who resented managerial authority and the loss of autonomy over their work
__label__0 many workers went on strikes in response  although some favored taylor s methods  since their pay was directly linked to the productivity increases that his methods achieved and since increased efficiency allowed companies to charge consumers lower prices
__label__0 white middle  class reformers were appalled at the violence of race relations in the nation but typically shared the belief in racial characteristics and the superiority of anglo  saxon whites over african americans  asians   ethnic  europeans  indians  and latin american populations
__label__0 southern reformers considered segregation a progressive solution to racial violence  across the nation  educated middle  class americans enthusiastically followed the work of eugenicists who identified virtually all human behavior as inheritable traits and issued awards at county fairs to families and individuals for their  racial fitness
__label__0 it was against this tide that african american leaders developed their own voice in the progressive era  working along diverse paths to improve the lives and conditions of african americans throughout the country
__label__0 by   internal fights over the role of women in the fight for african american equal rights lessened the interest in the niagara movement
__label__0 but the movement laid the groundwork for the creation of the national association for the advancement of colored people  naacp   founded in
__label__0 du bois served as the influential director of publications for the naacp from its inception until
__label__0 although not as flamboyant or outwardly progressive as roosevelt  taft s organizational skills and generally solid performance as president aligned with the party leadership s concerns over another roosevelt presidency and secured for him the republican party s nomination
__label__0 angry over this snub  in   roosevelt and the other progressive republicans bolted from the republican party and formed the progressive party
__label__0 his popularity had him hoping to win the presidential race as a third  party candidate
__label__0 fearing future loss of the territory through military conflict  as well as desiring to create challenges for great britain  which they had fought in the crimean war   russia had happily accepted the american purchase offer
__label__0 in the united states  several newspaper editors openly questioned the purchase and labeled it  seward s folly    link
__label__0 they highlighted the lack of americans to populate the vast region and lamented the challenges in attempting to govern the native peoples in that territory
__label__0 shippers and other businessmen  particularly in the sugar industry  supported american intervention to safeguard their own interests in the region
__label__0 likewise  the  cuba libre  movement founded by jos mart  who quickly established offices in new york and florida  further stirred american interest in the liberation cause
__label__0 the difference in this uprising  however  was that supporters saw in the renewed us navy a force that could be a strong ally for cuba
__label__0 domestically  the country was neither unified in their support of the treaty nor in the idea of the united states building an empire at all
__label__1 many prominent americans  including jane addams  former president grover cleveland  andrew carnegie  mark twain  and samuel gompers  felt strongly that the country should not be pursuing an empire  and  in   they formed the anti  imperialist league to oppose this expansionism
__label__0 the reasons for their opposition were varied  some felt that empire building went against the principles of democracy and freedom upon which the country was founded  some worried about competition from foreign workers  and some held the xenophobic viewpoint that the assimilation of other races would hurt the country
__label__0 carranza refused to work with wilson and the us government  and instead threatened to defend mexico s mineral rights against all american oil companies established there
__label__0 wilson then turned to support rebel forces who opposed carranza  most notably pancho villa   link
__label__0 however  villa lacked the strength in number or weapons to overtake carranza  in   wilson reluctantly authorized official us recognition of carranza s government
__label__0 the war effort was costly  with an eventual price tag in excess of   billion by and the government needed to finance it
__label__1 the liberty loan act allowed the federal government to sell liberty bonds to the american public  extolling citizens to  do their part  to help the war effort and bring the troops home
__label__0 the government ultimately raised   billion through liberty bonds
__label__1 first during world war i  then again in world war ii  these women stepped up to run farms and other agricultural enterprises  as men left for the armed forces   link
__label__0 known as farmerettes  some twenty thousand women  mostly college educated and from larger urban areas  served in this capacity
__label__0 their reasons for joining were manifold
__label__0 as early as january   a full five months before us military forces fired their first shot in the war  and eleven months before the actual armistice  wilson announced his postwar peace plan before a joint session of congress
__label__1 referring to what became known as the fourteen points  wilson called for openness in all matters of diplomacy and trade  specifically  free trade  freedom of the seas  an end to secret treaties and negotiations  promotion of self  determination of all nations  and more
__label__0 in addition  he called for the creation of a league of nations to promote the new world order and preserve territorial integrity through open discussions in place of intimidation and war
__label__0 meanwhile  southern lynchings continued to escalate  with white mobs burning african americans at the stake
__label__1 during the  red summer  of   northern cities recorded twenty  five bloody race riots that killed over  people
__label__1 among these was the chicago race riot of   where a white mob stoned a young black boy to death because he swam too close to the  white beach  on lake michigan
__label__0 the s opened up new possibilities of mobility for a large percentage of the us population  as automobile manufacturers began to mass produce what had once been a luxury item  and daring aviators both demonstrated and drove advancements in aircraft technology
__label__0 the most significant innovation of this era was henry ford s model t ford  which made car ownership available to the average american
__label__0 many of these new immigrants were coming from eastern and southern europe and  for many english  speaking  native  born americans of northern european descent  the growing diversity of new languages  customs  and religions triggered anxiety and racial animosity
__label__1 in reaction  some embraced nativism  prizing white americans with older family trees over more recent immigrants  and rejecting outside influences in favor of their own local customs
__label__0 nativists also stoked a sense of fear over the perceived foreign threat  pointing to the anarchist assassinations of the spanish prime minister in   the italian king in   and even president william mckinley in  as proof
__label__0 many americans were disillusioned in the post  world war i era  and their reactions took many forms
__label__0 rebellious american youth  in particular  adjusted to the changes by embracing a new morality that was far more permissive than the social mores of their parents
__label__1 many young women of the era shed their mother s morality and adopted the dress and mannerisms of a flapper  the jazz age female stereotype  seeking the endless party
__label__0 the law proved difficult to enforce  as illegal alcohol soon poured in from canada and the caribbean  and rural americans resorted to home  brewed  moonshine
__label__0 the result was an eroding of respect for law and order  as many people continued to drink illegal liquor
__label__1 rather than bringing about an age of sobriety  as progressive reformers had hoped  it gave rise to a new subculture that included illegal importers  interstate smuggling  or bootlegging   clandestine saloons referred to as  speakeasies   hipflasks  cocktail parties  and the organized crime of trafficking liquor
__label__0 although his critics depicted him as weak  lazy  or incompetent  he was actually quite shrewd and politically astute
__label__0 together with his running mate  calvin coolidge  the governor of massachusetts  they attracted the votes of many americans who sought harding s promised return to normalcy
__label__0 in the election  harding defeated governor james cox of ohio by the greatest majority in the history of two  party politics   percent of the popular vote
__label__0 investors  along with the general public  withdrew their money from banks by the thousands  fearing the banks would go under
__label__0 the more people pulled out their money in bank runs  the closer the banks came to insolvency   link
__label__0 in   a major strike at the ford motor company factory near detroit resulted in over sixty injuries and four deaths
__label__1 often referred to as the ford hunger march  the event unfolded as a planned demonstration among unemployed ford workers who  to protest their desperate situation  marched nine miles from detroit to the company s river rouge plant in dearborn
__label__0 at the dearborn city limits  local police launched tear gas at the roughly three thousand protestors  who responded by throwing stones and clods of dirt
__label__0 this would establish the basis for franklin roosevelt s  good neighbor  policy
__label__1 after a goodwill tour of central american countries immediately following his election in   hoover shaped the subsequent clark memorandum  released in   which largely repudiated the previous roosevelt corollary  establishing a basis for unlimited american military intervention throughout latin america
__label__1 to the contrary  through the memorandum  hoover asserted that greater emphasis should be placed upon the older monroe doctrine  in which the us pledged assistance to her latin american neighbors should any european powers interfere in western hemisphere affairs
__label__0 the election of president franklin delano roosevelt signaled both immediate relief for the american public as well as a permanent shift in the role of the federal government in guiding the economy and providing direct assistance to the people  albeit through expensive programs that made extensive budget deficits commonplace
__label__0 for many  the immediate relief was  at a minimum  psychological  herbert hoover was gone  and the situation could not grow worse under roosevelt
__label__1 after the landslide election  the country  and hoover  had to endure the interregnum  the difficult four months between the election and president roosevelt s inauguration in march
__label__0 congress did not pass a single significant piece of legislation during this period  although hoover spent much of the time trying to get roosevelt to commit publicly to a legislative agenda of hoover s choosing
__label__0 at its peak  there were some four million americans repairing bridges  building roads and airports  and undertaking other public projects
__label__0 another work program was the civilian conservation corps relief act  ccc
__label__1 the ccc provided government jobs for young men aged fourteen to twenty  four who came from relief families
__label__1 regionally  roosevelt s work was most famously seen in the tennessee valley authority  tva    link    a federal agency tasked with the job of planning and developing the area through flood control  reforestation  and hydroelectric power
__label__0 employing several thousand americans on a project that roosevelt envisioned as a template for future regional redevelopment  the tva revitalized a river valley that landowners had badly over  farmed  leaving behind eroded soil that lacked essential nutrients for future farming
__label__1 the banking act of  was the most far  reaching revision of banking laws since the creation of the federal reserve system in
__label__0 previously  regional reserve banks  particularly the new york reserve bank  controlled by the powerful morgan and rockefeller families  had dominated policy  making at the federal reserve
__label__0 roosevelt sought to salvage this important piece of labor legislation  doing so with the wagner act
__label__1 the act created the national labor relations board  nlrb  to once again protect american workers  right to unionize and bargain collectively  as well as to provide a federal vehicle for labor grievances to be heard
__label__0 although roundly criticized by the republican party and factory owners  the wagner act withstood several challenges and eventually received constitutional sanction by the us supreme court in
__label__0 aubrey williams  the director of the nya  hired more black administrators than any other federal agency  and appointed them to oversee projects throughout the country
__label__0 one key figure in the nya was mary mcleod bethune   link    a prominent african american educator tapped by roosevelt to act as the director of the nya s division of negro affairs
__label__0 bethune had been a spokesperson and an educator for years  with this role  she became one of the president s foremost african american advisors
__label__1 at a conference in munich later that year  great britain s prime minister  neville chamberlain  and france s prime minister  douard daladier  agreed to the partial dismemberment of czechoslovakia and the occupation of the sudetenland  a region with a sizable german population  by german troops   link
__label__0 this munich pact offered a policy of appeasement  in the hope that german expansionist appetites could be satisfied without war
__label__0 but not long after the agreement  germany occupied the rest of czechoslovakia as well
__label__0 both groups ended their opposition  however  at the time of the german invasion of the soviet union and the japanese attack on pearl harbor  respectively
__label__0 nevertheless  during the war  some seventy  two thousand men registered as conscientious objectors  cos   and fifty  two thousand were granted that status
__label__0 of that fifty  two thousand  some accepted noncombat roles in the military  whereas others accepted unpaid work in civilian work camps
__label__0 after all  they argued  if the united states were going to denounce germany and japan for abusing human rights  the country should itself be as exemplary as possible
__label__1 indeed  core s actions were in keeping with the goals of the double v campaign that was begun in  by the pittsburgh courier  the largest african american newspaper at the time   link
__label__1 the campaign called upon african americans to accomplish the two  vs   victory over america s foreign enemies and victory over racism in the united states
__label__0 the japanese attack on pearl harbor unleashed a cascade of racist assumptions about japanese immigrants and japanese americans in the united states that culminated in the relocation and internment of  people of japanese ancestry   percent of whom had been born in the united states
__label__1 executive order   signed by roosevelt on february     gave the army power to remove people from  military areas  to prevent sabotage or espionage
__label__0 the army then used this authority to relocate people of japanese ancestry living along the pacific coast of washington  oregon  and california  as well as in parts of arizona  to internment camps in the american interior
__label__1 the  bataan death march   during which as many as  american and  filipino prisoners of war died  intensified anti  japanese feelings
__label__0 kamikaze attacks that took place towards the end of the war were regarded as proof of the irrationality of japanese martial values and mindless loyalty to emperor hirohito
__label__0 to counter soviet influence in the developing world  kennedy supported a variety of measures
__label__1 one of these was the alliance for progress  which collaborated with the governments of latin american countries to promote economic growth and social stability in nations whose populations might find themselves drawn to communism
__label__1 kennedy also established the agency for international development to oversee the distribution of foreign aid  and he founded the peace corps  which recruited idealistic young people to undertake humanitarian projects in asia  africa  and latin america
__label__0 the plan was to develop different strategies  tactics  and even military capabilities to respond more appropriately to small or medium  sized insurgencies  and political or diplomatic crises
__label__1 one component of flexible response was the green berets  a us army special forces unit trained in counterinsurgency  the military suppression of rebel and nationalist groups in foreign nations
__label__0 much of the kennedy administration s new approach to defense  however  remained focused on the ability and willingness of the united states to wage both conventional and nuclear warfare  and kennedy continued to call for increases in the american nuclear arsenal
__label__1 the civil rights act of   which prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race  color  national origin  and religion  also prohibited  in title vii  discrimination on the basis of sex
__label__0 ironically  protection for women had been included at the suggestion of a virginia congressman in an attempt to prevent the act s passage  his reasoning seemed to be that  while a white man might accept that african americans needed and deserved protection from discrimination  the idea that women deserved equality with men would be far too radical for any of his male colleagues to contemplate
__label__1 for carmichael  black power was the power of african americans to unite as a political force and create their own institutions apart from white  dominated ones  an idea also espoused in the s by political leader and orator marcus garvey
__label__1 like garvey  carmichael became an advocate of black separatism  arguing that african americans should live apart from whites and solve their problems for themselves
__label__0 in keeping with this philosophy  carmichael expelled sncc s white members
__label__0 besides demobilizing the armed forces and preparing for the homecoming of servicemen and women  he also had to guide the nation through the process of returning to a peacetime economy
__label__0 to this end  he proposed an ambitious program of social legislation that included establishing a federal minimum wage  expanding social security and public housing  and prohibiting child labor
__label__0 wartime price controls were retained for some items but removed from others  like meat
__label__0 in february   george kennan  a state department official stationed at the us embassy in moscow  sent an eight  thousand  word message to washington  dc
__label__1 in what became known as the  long telegram   kennan maintained that soviet leaders believed that the only way to protect the soviet union was to destroy  rival  nations and their influence over weaker nations
__label__0 according to kennan  the soviet union was not so much a revolutionary regime as a totalitarian bureaucracy that was unable to accept the prospect of a peaceful coexistence of the united states and itself
__label__0 like dominos toppling one another  entire regions would eventually be controlled by the soviets
__label__0 the demand for anti  communist containment appeared as early as march  in a speech by winston churchill  in which he referred to an iron curtain that divided europe into the  free  west and the communist east controlled by the soviet union
__label__0 witnesses were subpoenaed and required to testify before the committee  refusal could result in imprisonment
__label__0 those who invoked fifth amendment protections  or were otherwise suspected of communist sympathies  often lost their jobs or found themselves on a blacklist  which prevented them from securing employment
__label__0 notable artists who were blacklisted in the s and s include composer leonard bernstein  novelist dashiell hammett  playwright and screenwriter lillian hellman  actor and singer paul robeson  and musician artie shaw
__label__1 his new look strategy embraced nuclear  massive retaliation   a plan for nuclear response to a first soviet strike so devastating that the attackers would not be able to respond
__label__0 some labeled this approach  mutually assured destruction  or mad
__label__0 the growing number of cars on the road changed consumption patterns  and drive  in and drive  through convenience stores  restaurants  and movie theaters began to dot the landscape
__label__0 the first mcdonalds opened in san bernardino  california  in  to cater to drivers in a hurry
__label__0 not all efforts to enact desegregation required the use of the courts  however
__label__0 on april     jackie robinson started for the brooklyn dodgers  playing first base
__label__0 he was the first african american to play baseball in the national league  breaking the color barrier
__label__0 many national politicians supported the segregationist efforts
__label__1 in   ninety  six members of congress signed  the southern manifesto   in which they accused the us supreme court of misusing its power and violating the principle of states  rights  which maintained that states had rights equal to those of the federal government
__label__1 hippies  rejected the conventions of traditional society
__label__0 men sported beards and grew their hair long  both men and women wore clothing from non  western cultures  defied their parents  rejected social etiquettes and manners  and turned to music as an expression of their sense of self
__label__1 nixon also courted northern  blue  collar workers  whom he later called the silent majority  to acknowledge their belief that their voices were seldom heard
__label__0 these voters feared the social changes taking place in the country  antiwar protests challenged their own sense of patriotism and civic duty  whereas the recreational use of new drugs threatened their cherished principles of self  discipline  and urban riots invoked the specter of a racial reckoning
__label__1 the combination of unemployment and rising prices posed an unfamiliar challenge to economists whose fiscal policies of either expanding or contracting federal spending could only address one side of the problem at the cost of the other
__label__0 this phenomenon of  stagflation   a term that combined the economic conditions of stagnation and inflation  outlived the nixon administration  enduring into the early s
__label__0 as the conflict wore on and reports of brutalities increased  the antiwar movement grew in strength
__label__1 to take the political pressure off himself and his administration  and find a way to exit vietnam  with honor   nixon began the process of vietnamization  turning more responsibility for the war over to south vietnamese forces by training them and providing american weaponry  while withdrawing us troops from the field
__label__0 at the same time  however  nixon authorized the bombing of neighboring cambodia  which had declared its neutrality  in an effort to destroy north vietnamese and viet cong bases within that country and cut off supply routes between north and south vietnam
__label__0 in the weeks following the watergate break  in  bob woodward and carl bernstein  reporters for the washington post  received information from several anonymous sources  including one known to them only as  deep throat   that led them to realize the white house was deeply implicated in the break  in
__label__0 as the press focused on other events  woodward and bernstein continued to dig and publish their findings  keeping the public s attention on the unfolding scandal
__label__0 after two unsuccessful republican primary bids in  and   reagan won the presidency in
__label__0 his victory was the result of a combination of dissatisfaction with the presidential leadership of gerald ford and jimmy carter in the s and the growth of the new right
__label__1 this group of conservative americans included many very wealthy financial supporters and emerged in the wake of the social reforms and cultural changes of the s and s
__label__0 much of the intellectual meat of the reagan revolution came from conservative think tanks  policy or advocacy groups  that specifically sought to shape american political and social dialogues
__label__1 the heritage foundation  one such group  soon became the intellectual arm of the conservative movement
__label__0 because the disease was seen almost exclusively in male homosexuals  it was quickly dubbed  gay cancer
__label__0 doctors soon realized it often coincided with other symptoms  including a rare form of pneumonia  and they renamed it  gay related immune deficiency   grid   although people other than gay men  primarily intravenous drug users  were dying from the disease as well
__label__0 the connection between gay men and grid  later renamed human immunodeficiency virus  autoimmune deficiency syndrome  or hiv  aids  led heterosexuals largely to ignore the growing health crisis in the gay community  wrongly assuming they were safe from its effects
__label__0 the federal government also overlooked the disease  and calls for more money to research and find the cure were ignored
__label__0 reagan  however  overlooked the legitimate complaints of the sandinistas and believed that their rule opened the region to cuban and soviet influence
__label__1 a year into his presidency  convinced it was folly to allow the expansion of soviet and communist influence in latin america  he authorized the central intelligence agency  cia  to equip and train a group of anti  sandinista nicaraguans known as the contras  contrarevolucionrios or  counter  revolutionaries   to oust ortega
__label__0 soon they were mounting fierce opposition to the bill
__label__0 moderate conservatives dubbed the reform proposals  hillarycare  and argued that the bill was an unwarranted expansion of the powers of the federal government that would interfere with people s ability to choose the healthcare provider they wanted
__label__0 those further to the right argued that healthcare reform was part of a larger and nefarious plot to control the public
__label__0 lieberman had been quick to denounce clinton s relationship with monica lewinsky
__label__1 consumer advocate ralph nader ran as the candidate of the green party  a party devoted to environmental issues and grassroots activism  and democrats feared that he would attract votes that gore might otherwise win
__label__1 on september   in an address to a joint session of congress  bush declared war on terrorism  blamed al  qaeda leader osama bin laden for the attacks  and demanded that the radical islamic fundamentalists who ruled afghanistan  the taliban  turn bin laden over or face attack by the united states
__label__1 this speech encapsulated what became known as the bush doctrine  the belief that the united states has the right to protect itself from terrorist acts by engaging in pre  emptive wars or ousting hostile governments in favor of friendly  preferably democratic  regimes
__label__0 fearing that terrorists might strike within the nation s borders again  and aware of the chronic lack of cooperation among different federal law enforcement agencies  bush created the office of homeland security in october
__label__1 the next year  congress passed the homeland security act  creating the department of homeland security  which centralized control over a number of different government functions in order to better control threats at home   link
__label__1 the next year  congress passed the homeland security act  creating the department of homeland security  which centralized control over a number of different government functions in order to better control threats at home   link
__label__1 the bush administration also pushed the usa patriot act through congress  which enabled law enforcement agencies to monitor citizens  e  mails and phone conversations without a warrant
__label__0 in the end  no such weapons were ever found
__label__0 these criticisms were amplified by growing international concern over the treatment of prisoners at the guantanamo bay detention camp and widespread disgust over the torture conducted by us troops at the prison in abu ghraib  iraq  which surfaced only months before the election   link
__label__0 even though cdos consisted of subprime mortgages  credit card debt  and other risky investments  credit ratings agencies had a financial incentive to rate them as very safe
__label__1 making matters worse  financial institutions created instruments called credit default swaps  which were essentially a form of insurance on investments
__label__0 if the investment lost money  the investors would be compensated
__label__0 this popular denial has had huge global consequences
__label__1 in   the united states  which produces roughly  percent of the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that prevent the earth s heat from escaping into space  signed the kyoto protocol  an agreement among the world s nations to reduce their emissions of these gases
__label__0 president bush objected to the requirement that major industrialized nations limit their emissions to a greater extent than other parts of the world and argued that doing so might hurt the american economy
__label__0 with debt upon graduation averaging about    students may find their economic options limited
__label__0 instead of buying cars or paying for housing  they may have to join the boomerang generation and return to their parents  homes in order to make their loan payments
__label__0 in march   a group of musicians got together in a fish market in odessa for a spontaneous performance of beethoven s  ode to joy  from his ninth symphony
__label__0 while tensions were building over ukraine s efforts to join the european union  and even as russian troops had taken control of the ukrainian airbase in belbek  the odessa philharmonic orchestra and opera chorus tried to lighten the troubled times for shoppers with music and song  spontaneous gatherings like this are called flash mobs
__label__0 they often are captured on video and shared on the internet  frequently they go viral
__label__0 turner and killian    identified four types of crowds
__label__1 casual crowds consist of people who are in the same place at the same time but who are nt really interacting  such as people standing in line at the post office
__label__1 conventional crowds are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly  like a religious service
__label__0 they emphasize the importance of these norms in shaping crowd behavior  especially those norms that shift quickly in response to changing external factors
__label__1 emergent norm theory asserts that  in this circumstance  people perceive and respond to the crowd situation with their particular  individual  set of norms  which may change as the crowd experience evolves
__label__0 this focus on the individual component of interaction reflects a symbolic interactionist perspective  for turner and killian  the process begins when individuals suddenly find themselves in a new situation  or when an existing situation suddenly becomes strange or unfamiliar
__label__1 social movements are purposeful  organized groups that strive to work toward a common social goal
__label__0 while most of us learned about social movements in history classes  we tend to take for granted the fundamental changes they caused  and we may be completely unfamiliar with the trend toward global social movements
__label__0 examples include antinuclear groups  mothers against drunk driving  madd   the dreamers movement for immigration reform  and the human rights campaign s advocacy for marriage equality
__label__1 revolutionary movements seek to completely change every aspect of society
__label__0 these include the s counterculture movement  including the revolutionary group the weather underground  as well as anarchist collectives
__label__0 churches and their ministers joined the struggle  and the protest organization in friendship was formed as well as the friendly club and the club from nowhere
__label__1 a social movement industry  which is the collection of the social movement organizations that are striving toward similar goals  was growing
__label__0 martin luther king jr emerged during these events to become the charismatic leader of the movement  gained respect from elites in the federal government  and aided by even more emerging smos such as the student non  violent coordinating committee  sncc   the congress of racial equality  core   the national association for the advancement of colored people  naacp   and the southern christian leadership conference  sclc   among others
__label__0 several still exist today
__label__0 as you can see  there may be many competing prognostic frames even within social movements adhering to similar diagnostic frames
__label__1 finally  motivational framing is the call to action  what should you do once you agree with the diagnostic frame and believe in the prognostic frame
__label__0 these frames are action  oriented
__label__0 collective behavior and social movements are just two of the forces driving social change  which is the change in society created through social movements as well as external factors like environmental shifts or technological innovations
__label__0 essentially  any disruptive shift in the status quo  be it intentional or random  human  caused or natural  can lead to social change
__label__1 sociology is the study of groups and group interactions  societies and social interactions  from small and personal groups to very large groups
__label__1 a group of people who live in a defined geographic area  who interact with one another  and who share a common culture is what sociologists call a society
__label__1 the term culture refers to the group s shared practices  values  and beliefs
__label__0 culture encompasses a group s way of life  from routine  everyday interactions to the most important parts of group members  lives
__label__1 some sociologists study social facts  which are the laws  morals  values  religious beliefs  customs  fashions  rituals  and all of the cultural rules that govern social life  that may contribute to these changes in the family
__label__0 do people in the united states view marriage and family differently than before
__label__0 he argued that how an individual comes to view himself or herself is based to a very large extent on interactions with others
__label__1 mead called specific individuals that impacted a person s life significant others  and he also conceptualized  generalized others  as the organized and generalized attitude of a social group
__label__0 mead s work is closely associated with the symbolic interactionist approach and emphasizes the micro  level of analysis
__label__0 the different approaches to research based on positivism or antipositivism are often considered the foundation for the differences found today between quantitative sociology and qualitative sociology
__label__1 quantitative sociology uses statistical methods such as surveys with large numbers of participants
__label__0 researchers analyze data using statistical techniques to see if they can uncover patterns of human behavior
__label__0 for example  although suicide is generally considered an individual phenomenon  mile durkheim was interested in studying the social factors that affect it
__label__1 his studied social ties within a group  or social solidarity  and hypothesized that differences in suicide rates might be explained by religion  based differences
__label__0 durkheim gathered a large amount of data about europeans who had ended their lives  and he did indeed find differences based on religion
__label__1 functionalism  also called structural  functional theory  sees society as a structure with interrelated parts designed to meet the biological and social needs of the individuals in that society
__label__0 functionalism grew out of the writings of english philosopher and biologist  hebert spencer     who saw similarities between society and the human body  he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning  the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning  spencer
__label__0 alfred radcliffe  brown    defined the function of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as a whole  and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity  radcliffe  brown
__label__1 in a healthy society  all parts work together to maintain stability  a state called dynamic equilibrium by later sociologists such as parsons
__label__0 latent functions can be beneficial  neutral  or harmful
__label__1 social processes that have undesirable consequences for the operation of society are called dysfunctions
__label__0 in education  examples of dysfunction include getting bad grades  truancy  dropping out  not graduating  and not finding suitable employment
__label__0 for example  while a conflict theorist studying a political protest might focus on class difference  a symbolic interactionist would be more interested in how individuals in the protesting group interact  as well as the signs and symbols protesters use to communicate their message
__label__0 the focus on the importance of symbols in building a society led sociologists like erving goffman      to develop a technique called dramaturgical analysis
__label__1 goffman used theater as an analogy for social interaction and recognized that people s interactions showed patterns of cultural  scripts   because it can be unclear what part a person may play in a given situation  he or she has to improvise his or her role as the situation unfolds  goffman
__label__0 studies that use the symbolic interactionist perspective are more likely to use qualitative research methods  such as in  depth interviews or participant observation  because they seek to understand the symbolic worlds in which research subjects live
__label__0 many people believe  for example  that crime rates go up when there s a full moon  but research does nt support this opinion
__label__0 researchers rotton and kelly    conducted a meta  analysis of research on the full moon s effects on behavior
__label__1 meta  analysis is a technique in which the results of virtually all previous studies on a specific subject are evaluated together
__label__0 in this field  results of studies tend to provide people with access to knowledge they did not have before  knowledge of other cultures  knowledge of rituals and beliefs  or knowledge of trends and attitudes
__label__1 no matter what research approach they use  researchers want to maximize the study s reliability  which refers to how likely research results are to be replicated if the study is reproduced
__label__0 reliability increases the likelihood that what happens to one person will happen to all people in a group
__label__0 the next step researchers undertake is to conduct background research through a literature review  which is a review of any existing similar or related studies
__label__0 a visit to the library and a thorough online search will uncover existing research about the topic of study
__label__1 in research  independent variables are the cause of the change
__label__1 the dependent variable is the effect  or thing that is changed
__label__0 researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics and that fit with their overall approaches to research
__label__0 in planning studies  designs  sociologists generally choose from four widely used methods of social investigation  survey  field research  experiment  and secondary data analysis  or use of existing sources
__label__0 every research method comes with plusses and minuses  and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use
__label__0 surveys
__label__0 a survey targets a specific population  people who are the focus of a study  such as college athletes  international students  or teenagers living with type   juvenile  onset  diabetes
__label__1 most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population  or a sample  that is  a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population
__label__0 the success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample
__label__0 people are more likely to share honest answers if they can respond to questions anonymously
__label__1 this type of information is qualitative data  results that are subjective and often based on what is seen in a natural setting
__label__0 qualitative information is harder to organize and tabulate
__label__0 much of the data gathered in field research are based not on cause and effect but on correlation
__label__0 and while field research looks for correlation  its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables
__label__0 sometimes a researcher wants to study one specific person or event
__label__1 a case study is an in  depth analysis of a single event  situation  or individual
__label__0 to conduct a case study  a researcher examines existing sources like documents and archival records  conducts interviews  engages in direct observation and even participant observation  if possible  researchers might use this method to study a single case of  for example  a foster child  drug lord  cancer patient  criminal  or rape victim
__label__1 one of the advantages of secondary data is that it is nonreactive research  or unobtrusive research   meaning that it does not include direct contact with subjects and will not alter or influence people s behaviors
__label__0 unlike studies requiring direct contact with people  using previously published data does nt require entering a population and the investment and risks inherent in that research process
__label__0 while he accepted that some aspects of research design might be influenced by personal values  he declared it was entirely inappropriate to allow personal values to shape the interpretation of the responses
__label__1 sociologists  he stated  must establish value neutrality  a practice of remaining impartial  without bias or judgment  during the course of a study and in publishing results
__label__0 sociologists are obligated to disclose research findings without omitting or distorting significant data
__label__1 nonmaterial culture  in contrast  consists of the ideas  attitudes  and beliefs of a society
__label__0 material and nonmaterial aspects of culture are linked  and physical objects often symbolize cultural ideas
__label__0 the first  and perhaps most crucial  elements of culture we will discuss are its values and beliefs
__label__1 values are a culture s standard for discerning what is good and just in society
__label__0 values are deeply embedded and critical for transmitting and teaching a culture s beliefs
__label__1 values portray an ideal culture  the standards society would like to embrace and live up to
__label__1 but ideal culture differs from real culture  the way society actually is  based on what occurs and exists
__label__0 in an ideal culture  there would be no traffic accidents  murders  poverty  or racial tension
__label__1 these examples describe the visible and invisible rules of conduct through which societies are structured  or what sociologists call norms
__label__0 norms define how to behave in accordance with what a society has defined as good  right  and important  and most members of the society adhere to them
__label__0 breaching experiments uncover and explore the many unwritten social rules we live by  norms may be further classified as either mores or folkways
__label__1 mores  mor  ays  are norms that embody the moral views and principles of a group
__label__0 violating them can have serious consequences
__label__0 while different cultures have varying systems of symbols  one symbol is common to all  language
__label__1 language is a symbolic system through which people communicate and through which culture is transmitted
__label__0 some languages contain a system of symbols used for written communication  while others rely on only spoken communication and nonverbal actions
__label__1 the term popular culture refers to the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in mainstream society
__label__0 popular culture events might include a parade  a baseball game  or the season finale of a television show
__label__1 an innovation refers to an object or concept s initial appearance in society  it s innovative because it is markedly new
__label__0 there are two ways to come across an innovative object or idea  discover it or invent it
__label__0 material culture tends to diffuse more quickly than nonmaterial culture  technology can spread through society in a matter of months  but it can take generations for the ideas and beliefs of society to change
__label__1 sociologist william f ogburn coined the term culture lag to refer to this time that elapses between the introduction of a new item of material culture and its acceptance as part of nonmaterial culture  ogburn
__label__0 culture lag can also cause tangible problems
__label__0 exactly what is a society
__label__1 in sociological terms  society refers to a group of people who live in a definable community and share the same culture
__label__0 on a broader scale  society consists of the people and institutions around us  our shared beliefs  and our cultural ideas
__label__0 previously  the depletion of a region s crops or water supply forced pastoral societies to relocate in search of food sources for their livestock
__label__0 horticultural societies formed in areas where rainfall and other conditions allowed them to grow stable crops
__label__0 they were similar to hunter  gatherers in that they largely depended on the environment for survival  but since they did nt have to abandon their location to follow resources  they were able to start permanent settlements
__label__0 postindustrial societyinformation societies  sometimes known as postindustrial or digital societies  are a recent development
__label__1 unlike industrial societies that are rooted in the production of material goods  information societies are based on the production of information and services
__label__0 in his quest to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways  he wrote   if i do not submit to the conventions of society  if in my dress i do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in my class  the ridicule i provoke  the social isolation in which i am kept  produce  although in an attenuated form  the same effects as punishment   durkheim
__label__1 durkheim also believed that social integration  or the strength of ties that people have to their social groups  was a key factor in social life
__label__0 following the ideas of comte and spencer  durkheim likened society to a living organism  in which each organ plays a necessary role in keeping the being alive
__label__0 even the socially deviant members of society are necessary  durkheim argued  as punishments for deviance affirm established cultural values and norms
__label__0 laws exist as formalized morals and are based on restitution rather than revenge
__label__0 while the transition from mechanical to organic solidarity is  in the long run  advantageous for a society  durkheim noted that it can be a time of chaos and  normlessness
__label__0 one of the outcomes of the transition is something he called social anomie
__label__1 anomie  literally   without law   is a situation in which society no longer has the support of a firm collective consciousness
__label__0 marx described modern society in terms of alienation
__label__1 alienation refers to the condition in which the individual is isolated and divorced from his or her society  work  or the sense of self
__label__0 marx defined four specific types of alienation
__label__0 weber s analysis of modern society centered on the concept of rationalization
__label__1 a rational society is one built around logic and efficiency rather than morality or tradition
__label__0 in a sense  it exists by consensus  both prior and current
__label__1 this is an example of the process of institutionalization  the act of implanting a convention or norm into society
__label__0 bear in mind that the institution  while socially constructed  is still quite real
__label__0 roles and statusas you can imagine  people employ many types of behaviors in day  to  day life
__label__1 roles are patterns of behavior that we recognize in each other that are representative of a person s social status
__label__0 currently  while reading this text  you are playing the role of a student
__label__1 some statuses are ascribed  those you do not select  such as son  elderly person  or female
__label__1 others  called achieved statuses  are obtained by choice  such as a high school dropout  self  made millionaire  or nurse
__label__0 as a daughter or son  you occupy a different status than as a neighbor or employee
__label__0 consider the duties of a parent  cooking  cleaning  driving  problem  solving  acting as a source of moral guidance  the list goes on
__label__0 similarly  a person can experience role conflict when one or more roles are contradictory
__label__0 a parent who also has a full  time career can experience role conflict on a daily basis
__label__0 in the s  as the urban population greatly expanded and transportation options improved  suburbs developed
__label__1 suburbs are the communities surrounding cities  typically close enough for a daily commute in  but far enough away to allow for more space than city living affords
__label__0 the bucolic suburban landscape of the early twentieth century has largely disappeared due to sprawl
__label__0 together  the suburbs  exurbs  and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis
__label__1 new york was the first us megalopolis  a huge urban corridor encompassing multiple cities and their surrounding suburbs
__label__0 these metropolises use vast quantities of natural resources and are a growing part of the us landscape  the suburban sprawl in toronto means long commutes and traffic congestion
__label__0 the world s most densely populated cities are now largely concentrated in the global south  a marked change from several decades ago when the biggest cities were found in the global north
__label__1 in the next forty years  the biggest global challenge for urbanized populations  particularly in less developed countries  will be to achieve development that occurs without depleting or damaging the natural environment  also called sustainable development  united nations  department of economic and social affairs  population division
__label__1 the subfield of environmental sociology studies the way humans interact with their environments
__label__1 this field is closely related to human ecology  which focuses on the relationship between people and their built and natural environment
__label__0 and it is far more problematic than even the mountains of broken plastic and rusty metal that plague the environment
__label__1 e  waste is the name for obsolete  broken  and worn  out electronics  from computers to mobile phones to televisions
__label__1 the challenge is that these products  which are multiplying at alarming rates thanks in part to planned obsolescence  the designing of products to quickly become outdated and then be replaced by the constant emergence of newer and cheaper electronics   have toxic chemicals and precious metals in them  which makes for a dangerous combination
__label__0 without regular interaction  the holding  hugging  talking  the explanations and demonstrations given to most young children  she had not learned to walk or to speak  to eat or to interact  to play or even to understand the world around her
__label__0 from a sociological point of view  danielle had not been socialized
__label__1 socialization is the process through which people are taught to be proficient members of a society
__label__0 it describes the ways that people come to understand societal norms and expectations  to accept society s beliefs  and to be aware of societal values
__label__1 sociologists measure fertility using the crude birthrate  the number of live births per  people per year
__label__1 just as fertility measures childbearing  the mortality rate is a measure of the number of people who die
__label__1 the crude death rate is a number derived from the number of deaths per  people per year
__label__0 moral development is an important part of the socialization process
__label__1 the term refers to the way people learn what society considered to be  good  and  bad   which is important for a smoothly functioning society
__label__1 fracking  another word for hydraulic fracturing  is a method used to recover gas and oil from shale by drilling down into the earth and directing a high  pressure mixture of water  sand  and proprietary chemicals into the rock
__label__0 commonly  this process also includes drilling horizontally into the rock to create new pathways for gas to travel
__label__0 first  members entering an institution must leave behind their old identity through what is known as a degradation ceremony
__label__1 in a degradation ceremony  new members lose the aspects of their old identity and are given new identities
__label__0 the process is sometimes gentle
__label__1 another example of a nongroup is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way
__label__1 these people are considered a category  and as an example all children born from approximately  are referred to as  millennials
__label__0 why are millennials a category and not a group
__label__0 because while some of them may share a sense of identity  they do not  as a whole  interact frequently with each other  interestingly  people within an aggregate or category can become a group
__label__0 they may also be task  focused and time  limited
__label__0 these groups serve an instrumental function rather than an expressive one  meaning that their role is more goal or task  oriented than emotional
__label__0 a classroom or office can be an example of a secondary group
__label__1 a small group is typically one where the collection of people is small enough that all members of the group know each other and share simultaneous interaction  such as a nuclear family  a dyad  or a triad
__label__1 georg simmel      wrote extensively about the difference between a dyad  or two  member group  and a triad  which is a three  member group  simmel
__label__0 in the former  if one person withdraws  the group can no longer exist
__label__0 a further risk is that group members might pick sides and entrench themselves into opposing factions rather than reaching a solution
__label__1 in contrast  a laissez  faire leader  french for  leave it alone   is hands  off  allowing group members to self  manage and make their own decisions
__label__0 an example of this kind of leader might be an art teacher who opens the art cupboard  leaves materials on the shelves  and tells students to help themselves and make some art
__label__0 the audubon society and a ski club are examples of normative organizations
__label__1 coercive organizations are groups that we must be coerced  or pushed  to join
__label__0 these may include prison or a rehabilitation center
__label__0 people often complain about bureaucracies  declaring them slow  rule  bound  difficult to navigate  and unfriendly
__label__1 let s take a look at terms that define a bureaucracy to understand what they mean  hierarchy of authority refers to the aspect of bureaucracy that places one individual or office in charge of another  who in turn must answer to her own superiors
__label__0 for example  as an employee at walmart  your shift manager assigns you tasks
__label__1 finally  bureaucracies are also characterized by impersonality  which takes personal feelings out of professional situations
__label__0 this characteristic grew  to some extent  out of a desire to protect organizations from nepotism  backroom deals  and other types of favoritism  simultaneously protecting customers and others served by the organization
__label__1 the mcdonaldization of society  ritzer   refers to the increasing presence of the fast food business model in common social institutions
__label__0 this business model includes efficiency  the division of labor   predictability  calculability  and control  monitoring
__label__1 all societies practice social control  the regulation and enforcement of norms
__label__0 the underlying goal of social control is to maintain social order  an arrangement of practices and behaviors on which society s members base their daily lives
__label__0 think of social order as an employee handbook and social control as a manager
__label__0 a promotion at work is a positive sanction for working hard
__label__1 negative sanctions are punishments for violating norms
__label__0 being arrested is a punishment for shoplifting
__label__1 sociologist robert merton agreed that deviance is an inherent part of a functioning society  but he expanded on durkheim s ideas by developing strain theory  which notes that access to socially acceptable goals plays a part in determining whether a person conforms or deviates
__label__0 from birth  we re encouraged to achieve the  american dream  of financial success
__label__1 conflict theory looks to social and economic factors as the causes of crime and deviance
__label__0 unlike functionalists  conflict theorists do nt see these factors as positive functions of society
__label__0 those who do  however  have often been labeled  deviant  by society and have gradually come to believe it themselves
__label__1 labeling theory examines the ascribing of a deviant behavior to another person by members of society
__label__0 thus  what is considered deviant is determined not so much by the behaviors themselves or the people who commit them  but by the reactions of others to these behaviors
__label__0 if you use a crowbar to break into a car  you are committing a nonviolent crime  if you mug someone with the crowbar  you are committing a violent crime
__label__0 when we think of crime  we often picture street crime  or offenses committed by ordinary people against other people or organizations  usually in public spaces
__label__1 an often overlooked category is corporate crime  or crime committed by white  collar workers in a business environment
__label__0 both victims were drugged  sodomized  and forced to burn one another with cigarettes
__label__0 when questioned by police  the ringleader of the crime explained that the victims were gay and  looked like  they  liked it   wilson and baker
__label__1 attacks based on a person s race  religion  or other characteristics are known as hate crimes
__label__0 hate crimes in the united states evolved from the time of early european settlers and their violence toward native americans
__label__1 police are a civil force in charge of enforcing laws and public order at a federal  state  or community level
__label__0 no unified national police force exists in the united states  although there are federal law enforcement officers
__label__0 it is easy to look at the latest sleek apple product and think technology is a recent addition to our world
__label__0 but from the steam engine to the most cutting  edge robotic surgery tools  technology has described the application of science to address the problems of daily life
__label__0 we might look back at the enormous and clunky computers of the s that had about as much storage as an ipod shuffle and roll our eyes in disbelief
__label__0 numerous facts sheets available through the government  nonprofits  and the private sector outline common safety measures  including the following  become familiar with privacy rights  read privacy policies when making a purchase  rather than simply clicking  accept    give out only the minimum information requested by any source  ask why information is being collected  how it is going to be used  and who will have access it  and monitor your credit history for red flags that indicate your identity has been compromised
__label__0 net neutrality
__label__0 the issue of net neutrality  the principle that all internet data should be treated equally by internet service providers  is part of the national debate about internet access and the digital divide
__label__0 on one side of this debate is the belief that those who provide internet service  like those who provide electricity and water  should be treated as common carriers  legally prohibited from discriminating based on the customer or nature of the goods
__label__0 theorists using the conflict perspective suggest that issues with the healthcare system  as with most other social problems  are rooted in capitalist society
__label__0 according to conflict theorists  capitalism and the pursuit of profit lead to the commodification of health  the changing of something not generally thought of as a commodity into something that can be bought and sold in a marketplace
__label__0 in this view  people with money and power  the dominant group  are the ones who make decisions about how the healthcare system will be run
__label__0 healthcare us
__label__0 healthcare coverage can broadly be divided into two main categories  public healthcare  government  funded  and private healthcare  privately funded
__label__1 the two main publicly funded healthcare programs are medicare  which provides health services to people over sixty  five years old as well as people who meet other standards for disability  and medicaid  which provides services to people with very low incomes who meet other eligibility requirements
__label__0 one critique of the patient protection and affordable care act is that it will create a system of socialized medicine  a term that for many people in the united states has negative connotations lingering from the cold war era and earlier
__label__1 under a socialized medicine system  the government owns and runs the system
__label__0 it employs the doctors  nurses  and other staff  and it owns and runs the hospitals  klein
__label__0 the discrepancy between black and white americans shows the gap clearly  in   the average life expectancy for white males was approximately five years longer than for black males   compared to
__label__0 an even stronger disparity was found in   the infant mortality  which is the number of deaths in a given time or place  rate for blacks was nearly twice that of whites at  compared to  per  live births  us census bureau
__label__0 according to a report from the henry j kaiser foundation     african americans also have higher incidence of several other diseases and causes of mortality  from cancer to heart disease to diabetes
__label__0 in the post  millennial united states  those of us who have never experienced such a disadvantage take for granted the rights our society guarantees for each citizen
__label__0 we do not think about the relatively recent nature of the protections  unless  of course  we know someone constantly inconvenienced by the lack of accommodations or misfortune of suddenly experiencing a temporary disability
__label__1 mental healthpeople with mental disorders  a condition that makes it more difficult to cope with everyday life  and people with mental illness  a severe  lasting mental disorder that requires long  term treatment  experience a wide range of effects
__label__0 according to the national institute of mental health  nimh   the most common mental disorders in the united states are anxiety disorders
__label__0 almost  percent of us adults are likely to be affected in a single year  and  percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime  national institute of mental health
__label__1 disability refers to a reduction in one s ability to perform everyday tasks
__label__0 the world health organization makes a distinction between the various terms used to describe handicaps that s important to the sociological perspective
__label__0 even after slavery was abolished in   the next  years of us history saw institutionalized racism and prejudice against black people
__label__0 in an example of stereotype interchangeability  the same insults that are flung today at the overweight and obese population  lazy  for instance   have been flung at various racial and ethnic groups in earlier history
__label__0 of course  no one gives voice to these kinds of views in public now  except when talking about obese people
__label__0 why is it considered acceptable to feel prejudice toward  even to hate  obese people
__label__0 in essence  goffman    suggests we might view illness as a stigma that can push others to view the ill in an undesirable manner
__label__0 the stigmatization of illness often has the greatest effect on the patient and the kind of care he or she receives
__label__0 many contend that our society and even our healthcare institutions discriminate against certain diseases  like mental disorders  aids  venereal diseases  and skin disorders  sartorius
__label__0 this regulatory body will patent three types of innovation
__label__0 utility patents are the first type
__label__1 these are granted for the invention or discovery of any new and useful process  product  or machine  or for a significant improvement to existing technologies
__label__1 anderson and tushman    suggest an evolutionary model of technological change  in which a breakthrough in one form of technology leads to a number of variations
__label__0 once those are assessed  a prototype emerges  and then a period of slight adjustments to the technology  interrupted by a breakthrough
__label__0 in this section  we will look more closely at how media globalization and technological globalization play out in a sociological perspective
__label__1 as the names suggest  media globalization is the worldwide integration of media through the cross  cultural exchange of ideas  while technological globalization refers to the cross  cultural development and exchange of technology
__label__1 technological globalization is speeded in large part by technological diffusion  the spread of technology across borders
__label__0 in the last two decades  there has been rapid improvement in the spread of technology to peripheral and semi  peripheral nations  and a  world bank report discusses both the benefits and ongoing challenges of this diffusion
__label__0 social scientists take the idea of the surveillance society so seriously that there is an entire journal devoted to its study  surveillance and society
__label__0 the panoptic surveillance envisioned by jeremy bentham  depicted in the form of an all  powerful  all  seeing government by george orwell in   and later analyzed by michel foucault    is increasingly realized in the form of technology used to monitor our every move
__label__0 this surveillance was imagined as a form of constant monitoring in which the observation posts are decentralized and the observed is never communicated with directly
__label__1 neo  luddites are people who see technology as symbolizing the coldness and alienation of modern life
__label__1 but for technophiles  technology symbolizes the potential for a brighter future
__label__0 for those adopting an ideological middle ground  technology might symbolize status  in the form of a massive flat  screen television  or failure  ownership of a basic old mobile phone with no bells or whistles
__label__1 schizophrenia is a devastating psychological disorder that is characterized by major disturbances in thought  perception  emotion  and behavior
__label__0 about   of the population experiences schizophrenia in their lifetime  and usually the disorder is first diagnosed during early adulthood  early to mids
__label__1 disorganized thinking refers to disjointed and incoherent thought processes  usually detected by what a person says
__label__0 the person might ramble  exhibit loose associations  jump from topic to topic   or talk in a way that is so disorganized and incomprehensible that it seems as though the person is randomly combining words
__label__1 negative symptoms are those that reflect noticeable decreases and absences in certain behaviors  emotions  or drives  green
__label__1 a person who exhibits diminished emotional expression shows no emotion in his facial expressions  speech  or movements  even when such expressions are normal or expected
__label__0 another variable that is linked to schizophrenia is marijuana use
__label__0 although a number of reports have shown that individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to use marijuana than are individuals without schizophrenia  thornicroft     such investigations can not determine if marijuana use leads to schizophrenia  or vice versa
__label__0 these experiences can include such events as combat  threatened or actual physical attack  sexual assault  natural disasters  terrorist attacks  and automobile accidents
__label__0 this criterion makes ptsd the only disorder listed in the dsm in which a cause  extreme trauma  is explicitly specified
__label__1 symptoms of ptsd include intrusive and distressing memories of the event  flashbacks  states that can last from a few seconds to several days  during which the individual relives the event and behaves as if the event were occurring at that moment  apa      avoidance of stimuli connected to the event  persistently negative emotional states  eg  fear  anger  guilt  and shame   feelings of detachment from others  irritability  proneness toward outbursts  and an exaggerated startle response  jumpiness
__label__0 for ptsd to be diagnosed  these symptoms must occur for at least one month
__label__1 bipolar and related disorders are a group of disorders in which mania is the defining feature
__label__1 mania is a state of extreme elation and agitation
__label__1 suicidal ideation  thoughts of death  not just fear of dying   thinking about or planning suicide  or making an actual suicide attempt
__label__1 people with persistent depressive disorder  previously known as dysthymia  experience depressed moods most of the day nearly every day for at least two years  as well as at least two of the other symptoms of major depressive disorder
__label__0 people with persistent depressive disorder are chronically sad and melancholy  but do not meet all the criteria for major depression
__label__1 during a manic episode  some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative  sometimes spontaneously starting conversations with strangers  others become excessively irritable and complain or make hostile comments
__label__0 the person may talk loudly and rapidly  exhibiting flight of ideas  abruptly switching from one topic to another
__label__0 these individuals are easily distracted  which can make a conversation very difficult
__label__1 another cognitive theory of depression  hopelessness theory  postulates that a particular style of negative thinking leads to a sense of hopelessness  which then leads to depression  abramson  metalsky   alloy
__label__1 according to this theory  hopelessness is an expectation that unpleasant outcomes will occur or that desired outcomes will not occur  and there is nothing one can do to prevent such outcomes
__label__0 one possible contributing factor in suicide is brain chemistry
__label__0 contemporary neurological research shows that disturbances in the functioning of serotonin are linked to suicidal behavior  pompili et al
__label__0 low levels of serotonin predict future suicide attempts and suicide completions  and low levels have been observed post  mortem among suicide victims  mann
__label__0 although hoarding was traditionally considered to be a symptom of ocd  considerable evidence suggests that hoarding represents an entirely different disorder  mataix  cols et al
__label__1 people with hoarding disorder can not bear to part with personal possessions  regardless of how valueless or useless these possessions are
__label__0 as a result  these individuals accumulate excessive amounts of usually worthless items that clutter their living areas   link
__label__0 this woman likely would experience anxiety of greater intensity and duration than would a year  old college junior who is having trouble finding a date for the annual social
__label__1 some people  however  experience anxiety that is excessive  persistent  and greatly out of proportion to the actual threat  if one s anxiety has a disruptive influence on one s life  this is a strong indicator that the individual is experiencing an anxiety disorder  anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive and persistent fear and anxiety  and by related disturbances in behavior  apa
__label__0 although anxiety is universally experienced  anxiety disorders cause considerable distress
__label__0 rachman    proposed that phobias can be acquired through three major learning pathways
__label__0 the first pathway is through classical conditioning
__label__1 as you may recall  classical conditioning is a form of learning in which a previously neutral stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus  ucs  that reflexively elicits an unconditioned response  ucr   eliciting the same response through its association with the unconditioned stimulus
__label__1 when people with social anxiety disorder are unable to avoid situations that provoke anxiety  they typically perform safety behaviors  mental or behavioral acts that reduce anxiety in social situations by reducing the chance of negative social outcomes
__label__0 safety behaviors include avoiding eye contact  rehearsing sentences before speaking  talking only briefly  and not talking about oneself  alden  bieling
__label__0 the exact genes and gene functions involved in this disorder  however  are not well  understood  apa
__label__1 neurobiological theories of panic disorder suggest that a region of the brain called the locus coeruleus may play a role in this disorder
__label__1 located in the brainstem  the locus coeruleus is the brain s major source of norepinephrine  a neurotransmitter that triggers the body s fight  or  flight response
__label__0 for example  an individual may worry about her health and finances  the health of family members  the safety of her children  or minor matters  eg  being late for an appointment  without having any legitimate reason for doing so  apa
__label__1 a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder requires that the diffuse worrying and apprehension characteristic of this disorder  what sigmund freud referred to as free  floating anxiety  is not part of another disorder  occurs more days than not for at least six months  and is accompanied by any three of the following symptoms  restlessness  difficulty concentrating  being easily fatigued  muscle tension  irritability  and sleep difficulties
__label__0 evidence from many sources indicates that most psychological disorders have a genetic component  in fact  there is little dispute that some disorders are largely due to genetic factors
__label__0 the graph in  link  shows heritability estimates for schizophrenia
__label__1 a psychological disorder is a condition characterized by abnormal thoughts  feelings  and behaviors
__label__1 psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders  including their symptoms  etiology  ie  their causes   and treatment
__label__0 the term psychopathology can also refer to the manifestation of a psychological disorder
__label__0 no universal definition of psychological disorder exists that can apply to all situations in which a disorder is thought to be present  zachar  kendler
__label__0 however  one of the more influential conceptualizations was proposed by wakefield     who defined psychological disorder as a harmful dysfunction
__label__1 wakefield argued that natural internal mechanisms  that is  psychological processes honed by evolution  such as cognition  perception  and learning  have important functions  such as enabling us to experience the world the way others do and to engage in rational thought  problem solving  and communication
__label__0 the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders  dsm
__label__0 although a number of classification systems have been developed over time  the one that is used by most mental health professionals in the united states is the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders  dsm   published by the american psychiatric association
__label__0 note that the american psychiatric association differs from the american psychological association  both are abbreviated apa
__label__1 trait theorists believe personality can be understood via the approach that all people have certain traits  or characteristic ways of behaving
__label__0 do you tend to be sociable or shy
__label__0 as you have learned in this chapter  personality is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors
__label__0 the culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality  triandis  suh
__label__1 the term culture refers to all of the beliefs  customs  art  and traditions of a particular society
__label__0 one of the most widely used personality inventories is the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory  mmpi   first published in   with  true  false questions  and updated to the mmpi in   with  questions
__label__0 the original mmpi was based on a small  limited sample  composed mostly of minnesota farmers and psychiatric patients  the revised inventory was based on a more representative  national sample to allow for better standardization
__label__0 a second projective test is the thematic apperception test  tat   created in the s by henry murray  an american psychologist  and a psychoanalyst named christiana morgan
__label__1 a person taking the tat is shown  ambiguous pictures and is asked to tell a story about each picture
__label__0 the c  tcb contains  color images that show scenes of african  american lifestyles
__label__0 when the c  tcb was compared with the tat for african americans  it was found that use of the c  tcb led to increased story length  higher degrees of positive feelings  and stronger identification with the c  tcb  hoy    hoy  watkins  jenkins  moore
__label__1 the temas multicultural thematic apperception test is another tool designed to be culturally relevant to minority groups  especially hispanic youths
__label__0 what is biology
__label__1 in simple terms  biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments
__label__0 this is a very broad definition because the scope of biology is vast
__label__0 the steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later  but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments
__label__1 a hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event  which can be tested
__label__0 although using the scientific method is inherent to science  it is inadequate in determining what science is
__label__0 for some experts  the natural sciences are astronomy  biology  chemistry  earth science  and physics
__label__1 other scholars choose to divide natural sciences into life sciences  which study living things and include biology  and physical sciences  which study nonliving matter and include astronomy  geology  physics  and chemistry
__label__0 some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary
__label__0 both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study  descriptive science and hypothesis  based science
__label__1 descriptive  or discovery  science  which is usually inductive  aims to observe  explore  and discover  while hypothesis  based science  which is usually deductive  begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested
__label__1 descriptive  or discovery  science  which is usually inductive  aims to observe  explore  and discover  while hypothesis  based science  which is usually deductive  begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested
__label__0 the boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred  and most scientific endeavors combine both approaches
__label__1 the introduction starts with brief  but broad  background information about what is known in the field
__label__0 a good introduction also gives the rationale of the work  it justifies the work carried out and also briefly mentions the end of the paper  where the hypothesis or research question driving the research will be presented
__label__0 some journals require a results section followed by a discussion section  but it is more common to combine both
__label__1 if the journal does not allow the combination of both sections  the results section simply narrates the findings without any further interpretation
__label__0 the results are presented by means of tables or graphs  but no duplicate information should be presented
__label__0 atoms form molecules
__label__1 a molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds
__label__1 many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules  large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization  a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers  which are simpler than macromolecules
__label__0 examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts  which carry out indispensable functions  mitochondria produce energy to power the cell  while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars
__label__1 all living things are made of cells  the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms
__label__0 this requirement is why viruses are not considered living  they are not made of cells
__label__1 in larger organisms  cells combine to make tissues  which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions
__label__1 organs are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function
__label__0 organs are present not only in animals but also in plants
__label__1 all the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called a population
__label__0 for example  a forest may include many pine trees
__label__1 an ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic  non  living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water
__label__1 at the highest level of organization   link    the biosphere is the collection of all ecosystems  and it represents the zones of life on earth
__label__0 it includes land  water  and even the atmosphere to a certain extent  art connectionthe biological levels of organization of living things are shown
__label__0 biologists may pursue one of those subdisciplines and work in a more focused field
__label__0 for instance  molecular biology and biochemistry study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level  including interactions among molecules such as dna  rna  and proteins  as well as the way they are regulated
__label__1 microbiology  the study of microorganisms  is the study of the structure and function of single  celled organisms
__label__1 paleontology  another branch of biology  uses fossils to study life s history   link
__label__0 zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants  respectively
__label__1 matter is any substance that occupies space and has mass
__label__1 elements are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that can not be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions
__label__0 there are  elements  but only  occur naturally
__label__0 although similar in mass  protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge
__label__0 a proton is positively charged whereas a neutron is uncharged
__label__0 therefore  the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass  but not to its charge
__label__0 the number of neutrons is variable  resulting in isotopes  which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess
__label__1 together  the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element s mass number  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number
__label__0 the group  atoms helium  he   neon  ne   and argon  ar  all have filled outer electron shells  making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability  they are highly stable as single atoms
__label__0 their non  reactivity has resulted in their being named the inert gases  or noble gases
__label__0 compare this to the group  elements in the left  hand column
__label__0 two electrons fill the s orbital  and the third electron then fills the s orbital
__label__0 its electron configuration is ss
__label__0 neon  ne   on the other hand  has a total of ten electrons  two are in its innermost s orbital and eight fill its second shell  two each in the s and three p orbitals   thus  it is an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms
__label__0 chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are broken apart
__label__1 the substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants  usually found on the left side of a chemical equation   and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products  usually found on the right side of a chemical equation
__label__0 an arrow is typically drawn between the reactants and products to indicate the direction of the chemical reaction  this direction is not always a  one  way street
__label__0 for the creation of the water molecule shown above  the chemical equation would be
__label__0 some chemical reactions  such as the one shown above  can proceed in one direction until the reactants are all used up
__label__0 the equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible
__label__0 reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction
__label__1 nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons equally
__label__0 for example  molecular oxygen  o  is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two oxygen atoms
__label__0 water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions
__label__1 a polar substance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water is referred to as hydrophilic  hydro   water   philic   loving
__label__0 in contrast  non  polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water  as shown in  link  and separate from it rather than dissolve in it  as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar  an acidic water solution
__label__1 specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree celsius
__label__0 for water  this amount is one calorie
__label__0 it therefore takes water a long time to heat and long time to cool
__label__0 since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges  ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it
__label__1 therefore  water is referred to as a solvent  a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds
__label__0 the charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water  surrounding the particle with water molecules
__label__1 cohesion allows for the development of surface tension  the capacity of a substance to withstand being ruptured when placed under tension or stress
__label__0 this is also why water forms droplets when placed on a dry surface rather than being flattened out by gravity
__label__1 litmus or ph paper  filter paper that has been treated with a natural water  soluble dye so it can be used as a ph indicator  to test how much acid  acidity  or base  alkalinity  exists in a solution
__label__1 litmus or ph paper  filter paper that has been treated with a natural water  soluble dye so it can be used as a ph indicator  to test how much acid  acidity  or base  alkalinity  exists in a solution
__label__0 you might have even used some to test whether the water in a swimming pool is properly treated
__label__1 the ph scale is  as previously mentioned  an inverse logarithm and ranges from  to    link
__label__0 anything below   ranging from  to   is acidic  and anything above   from  to   is alkaline
__label__1 hydrocarbons are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen  such as methane  ch  described above
__label__0 we often use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuels  like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter
__label__0 the three  dimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their chemistry
__label__1 molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement  structure  of their atoms andor chemical bonds are known as isomers
__label__1 structural isomers  like butane and isobutene shown in  link  a  differ in the placement of their covalent bonds  both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens  ch   but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties
__label__1 enantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three  dimensional placement of atoms so that they are mirror images
__label__0 as shown in  link   an amino acid alanine example  the two structures are non  superimposable
__label__1 as you ve learned  biological macromolecules are large molecules  necessary for life  that are built from smaller organic molecules
__label__0 there are four major classes of biological macromolecules  carbohydrates  lipids  proteins  and nucleic acids   each is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions
__label__0 carbohydrates can be represented by the stoichiometric formula  cho  n  where n is the number of carbons in the molecule
__label__0 in other words  the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is      in carbohydrate molecules
__label__1 cellulose is the most abundant natural biopolymer
__label__0 the cell wall of plants is mostly made of cellulose  this provides structural support to the cell
__label__0 the three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar
__label__0 fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure
__label__0 some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin
__label__0 cis and trans indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double bond
__label__0 if hydrogens are present in the same plane  it is referred to as a cis fat  if the hydrogen atoms are on two different planes  it is referred to as a trans fat
__label__0 the cis double bond causes a bend or a  kink  that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly  keeping them liquid at room temperature   link
__label__1 phospholipids are major constituents of the plasma membrane  the outermost layer of animal cells
__label__0 like fats  they are composed of fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or sphingosine backbone
__label__1 amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins
__label__0 each amino acid has the same fundamental structure  which consists of a central carbon atom  also known as the alpha    carbon  bonded to an amino group  nh   a carboxyl group  cooh   and to a hydrogen atom
__label__0 the local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein
__label__0 the most common are the   helix and   pleated sheet structures   link
__label__0 in nature  some proteins are formed from several polypeptides  also known as subunits  and the interaction of these subunits forms the quaternary structure
__label__0 weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure
__label__0 the two main types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid  dna  and ribonucleic acid  rna
__label__1 dna is the genetic material found in all living organisms  ranging from single  celled bacteria to multicellular mammals
__label__0 dna and rna are made up of monomers known as nucleotides
__label__0 the nucleotides combine with each other to form a polynucleotide  dna or rna
__label__0 each nucleotide is made up of three components  a nitrogenous base  a pentose  five  carbon  sugar  and a phosphate group   link
__label__0 the carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as         and    is read as  one prime
__label__0 the phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the  carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the  carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide  which forms a  phosphodiester linkage
__label__0 the phosphodiester linkage is not formed by simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in macromolecules  its formation involves the removal of two phosphate groups
__label__0 as you have learned  information flow in an organism takes place from dna to rna to protein
__label__1 dna dictates the structure of mrna in a process known as transcription  and rna dictates the structure of protein in a process known as translation
__label__1 dna dictates the structure of mrna in a process known as transcription  and rna dictates the structure of protein in a process known as translation
__label__0 this is known as the central dogma of life  which holds true for all organisms  however  exceptions to the rule occur in connection with viral infections
__label__1 in contrast to light microscopes  electron microscopes   linkb  use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light
__label__0 not only does this allow for higher magnification and  thus  more detail   link    it also provides higher resolving power
__label__0 we will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes
__label__1 prokaryotic dna is found in a central part of the cell  the nucleoid   link
__label__0 this figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell
__label__0 all prokaryotes have chromosomal dna localized in a nucleoid  ribosomes  a cell membrane  and a cell wall
__label__1 the cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope  a structure to be discussed shortly
__label__0 it is made up of organelles suspended in the gel  like cytosol  the cytoskeleton  and various chemicals   link
__label__1 the nuclear envelope is a double  membrane structure that constitutes the outermost portion of the nucleus   link
__label__0 both the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are phospholipid bilayers
__label__0 when the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle  proteins are attached to chromosomes  and they resemble an unwound  jumbled bunch of threads
__label__1 these unwound protein  chromosome complexes are called chromatin   link    chromatin describes the material that makes up the chromosomes both when condensed and decondensed
__label__0 mitochondria  singular  mitochondrion  are often called the  powerhouses  or  energy factories  of a cell because they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate  atp   the cell s main energy  carrying molecule
__label__1 mitochondria  singular  mitochondrion  are often called the  powerhouses  or  energy factories  of a cell because they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate  atp   the cell s main energy  carrying molecule
__label__1 atp represents the short  term stored energy of the cell
__label__1 the centrosome is a microtubule  organizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells
__label__0 it contains a pair of centrioles  two structures that lie perpendicular to each other   link
__label__0 like the mitochondria  chloroplasts have their own dna and ribosomes  but chloroplasts have an entirely different function
__label__1 chloroplasts are plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis
__label__1 photosynthesis is the series of reactions that use carbon dioxide  water  and light energy to make glucose and oxygen
__label__1 within the cytoplasm  there would still be ions and organic molecules  plus a network of protein fibers that help maintain the shape of the cell  secure some organelles in specific positions  allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell  and enable cells within multicellular organisms to move
__label__0 collectively  this network of protein fibers is known as the cytoskeleton
__label__0 there are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton  microfilaments  intermediate filaments  and microtubules   link
__label__0 the walls of the microtubule are made of polymerized dimers of   tubulin and   tubulin  two globular proteins   link
__label__0 with a diameter of about  nm  microtubules are the widest components of the cytoskeleton
__label__0 they help the cell resist compression  provide a track along which vesicles move through the cell  and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell
__label__1 collagen fibers are interwoven with carbohydrate  containing protein molecules called proteoglycans
__label__0 collectively  these materials are called the extracellular matrix   link
__label__0 not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue  but it also allows the cells within the tissue to communicate with each other
__label__1 also found only in animal cells are desmosomes  which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells   link
__label__1 short proteins called cadherins in the plasma membrane connect to intermediate filaments to create desmosomes
__label__0 the plasma membrane of human red blood cells is  percent lipid
__label__0 carbohydrates are present only on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane and are attached to proteins  forming glycoproteins  or attached to lipids  forming glycolipids
__label__0 the head can form hydrogen bonds  but the tail can not
__label__1 a molecule with this arrangement of a positively or negatively charged area and an uncharged  or non  polar  area is referred to as amphiphilic or  dual  loving
__label__0 plasma membranes must allow certain substances to enter and leave a cell  and prevent some harmful materials from entering and some essential materials from leaving
__label__1 in other words  plasma membranes are selectively permeable  they allow some substances to pass through  but not others
__label__0 if they were to lose this selectivity  the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself  and it would be destroyed
__label__1 diffusion is a passive process of transport
__label__0 a single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across a space
__label__1 the integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively referred to as transport proteins  and they function as either channels for the material or carriers
__label__0 in both cases  they are transmembrane proteins
__label__0 another type of protein embedded in the plasma membrane is a carrier protein
__label__0 this aptly named protein binds a substance and  in doing so  triggers a change of its own shape  moving the bound molecule from the outside of the cell to its interior   link    depending on the gradient  the material may move in the opposite direction
__label__1 tonicity describes how an extracellular solution can change the volume of a cell by affecting osmosis
__label__0 a solution s tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution
__label__1 as for a hypertonic solution  the prefix hyper refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher osmolarity than the cell s cytoplasm  therefore  the fluid contains less water than the cell does
__label__0 because the cell has a relatively higher concentration of water  water will leave the cell
__label__1 active transport mechanisms require the use of the cell s energy  usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate  atp
__label__0 if a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient  that is  if the concentration of the substance inside the cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid  and vice versa   the cell must use energy to move the substance
__label__0 two mechanisms exist for the transport of small  molecular weight material and small molecules
__label__1 primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane  which is directly dependent on atp
__label__0 secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require atp
__label__0 an important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate movement  there are three types of these proteins or transporters   link
__label__1 a uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule
__label__1 a symporter carries two different ions or molecules  both in the same direction
__label__0 this difference in charge is important in creating the conditions necessary for the secondary process
__label__1 the sodium  potassium pump is  therefore  an electrogenic pump  a pump that creates a charge imbalance   creating an electrical imbalance across the membrane and contributing to the membrane potential
__label__1 the sodium  potassium pump is  therefore  an electrogenic pump  a pump that creates a charge imbalance   creating an electrical imbalance across the membrane and contributing to the membrane potential
__label__0 a variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis
__label__0 this literally means  cell drinking  and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid
__label__0 in receptor  mediated endocytosis  as in phagocytosis  clathrin is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane
__label__0 if uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor  mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective  the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood
__label__0 just as living things must continually consume food to replenish what has been used  cells must continually produce more energy to replenish that used by the many energy  requiring chemical reactions that constantly take place
__label__1 all of the chemical reactions that take place inside cells  including those that use energy and those that release energy  are the cell s metabolism
__label__1 thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter
__label__0 the matter and its environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system  and everything outside of that system is called the surroundings
__label__0 however  a wrecking ball that is not in motion is incapable of performing work
__label__1 energy associated with objects in motion is called kinetic energy
__label__0 a speeding bullet  a walking person  the rapid movement of molecules in the air  which produces heat   and electromagnetic radiation like light all have kinetic energy
__label__0 how can the energy released from one reaction be compared to that of another reaction
__label__0 a measurement of free energy is used to quantitate these energy transfers
__label__0 free energy is called gibbs free energy  abbreviated with the letter g  after josiah willard gibbs  the scientist who developed the measurement
__label__0 thus  the products of these reactions can be thought of as energy  storing molecules
__label__1 these chemical reactions are called endergonic reactions  and they are non  spontaneous
__label__0 an endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free energy
__label__0 the source of the activation energy needed to push reactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings
__label__1 heat energy  the total bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction  speeds up the motion of molecules  increasing the frequency and force with which they collide  it also moves atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly  helping them reach their transition state
__label__0 for this reason  heating up a system will cause chemical reactants within that system to react more frequently
__label__1 the chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzyme s substrates
__label__0 there may be one or more substrates  depending on the particular chemical reaction
__label__0 this model asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step
__label__0 however  current research supports a more refined view called induced fit   link
__label__1 the induced  fit model expands upon the lock  and  key model by describing a more dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate
__label__0 many enzymes do nt work optimally  or even at all  unless bound to other specific non  protein helper molecules  either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds
__label__0 two types of helper molecules are cofactors and coenzymes
__label__0 binding to these molecules promotes optimal conformation and function for their respective enzymes
__label__0 this repulsion makes the adp and atp molecules inherently unstable
__label__1 the release of one or two phosphate groups from atp  a process called dephosphorylation  releases energy
__label__0 most of the atp generated during glucose catabolism  however  is derived from a much more complex process  chemiosmosis  which takes place in mitochondria   link   within a eukaryotic cell or the plasma membrane of a prokaryotic cell
__label__1 chemiosmosis  a process of atp production in cellular metabolism  is used to generate  percent of the atp made during glucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight
__label__0 the production of atp using the process of chemiosmosis is called oxidative phosphorylation because of the involvement of oxygen in the process
__label__0 nearly all living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism
__label__1 the process does not use oxygen and is therefore anaerobic
__label__0 glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
__label__0 if the cell can not catabolize the pyruvate molecules further  it will harvest only two atp molecules from one molecule of glucose
__label__1 mature mammalian red blood cells are not capable of aerobic respiration  the process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygen  and glycolysis is their sole source of atp
__label__0 if glycolysis is interrupted  these cells lose their ability to maintain their sodium  potassium pumps  and eventually  they die
__label__0 as the protein passes along the golgi s cisternae  it is further modified by the addition of more carbohydrates
__label__0 after its synthesis is complete  it exits as integral membrane protein of the vesicle that bud from the golgi s trans face and when the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane the protein becomes integral portion of that cell membrane
__label__0 credit  modification of work by magnus manske
__label__1 the smooth endoplasmic reticulum  ser  is continuous with the rer but has few or no ribosomes on its cytoplasmic surface   link
__label__0 functions of the ser include synthesis of carbohydrates  lipids  and steroid hormones  detoxification of medications and poisons  and storage of calcium ions
__label__0 complex ii directly receives fadh  which does not pass through complex i
__label__1 the compound connecting the first and second complexes to the third is ubiquinone  q
__label__0 the q molecule is lipid soluble and freely moves through the hydrophobic core of the membrane
__label__0 in contrast  some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor
__label__0 both methods are called anaerobic cellular respiration in which organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen
__label__1 other organisms  such as animals  fungi  and most other bacteria  are termed heterotrophs   other feeders    because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs
__label__1 a third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars  not by using sunlight s energy  but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds  hence  they are referred to as chemoautotrophs
__label__0 the stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf  which helps to minimize water loss
__label__0 each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes
__label__0 in all autotrophic eukaryotes  photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast
__label__0 for plants  chloroplast  containing cells exist in the mesophyll
__label__1 embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll  a pigment  molecule that absorbs light  responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material  and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain
__label__0 the thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen
__label__1 as shown in  link   a stack of thylakoids is called a granum  and the liquid  filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or  bed   not to be confused with stoma or  mouth   an opening on the leaf epidermis
__label__0 art connection
__label__0 in the light  dependent reactions  energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy
__label__0 in the light  independent reactions  the chemical energy harvested during the light  dependent reactions drive the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide
__label__0 the inorganic material of soil consists of rock  slowly broken down into smaller particles that vary in size
__label__1 soil particles that are  to  mm in diameter are sand
__label__1 soil particles between  and  mm are called silt  and even smaller particles  less than  mm in diameter  are called clay
__label__1 soil distribution is not homogenous because its formation results in the production of layers  together  the vertical section of a soil is called the soil profile
__label__0 within the soil profile  soil scientists define zones called horizons
__label__1 the organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material
__label__1 mineral soils form directly from the weathering of bedrock  the solid rock that lies beneath the soil  and therefore  they have a similar composition to the original rock
__label__0 other soils form in materials that came from elsewhere  such as sand and glacial drift
__label__1 topsoil is rich in organic material  microbial processes occur there  and it is the  workhorse  of plant production
__label__1 the a horizon consists of a mixture of organic material with inorganic products of weathering  and it is therefore the beginning of true mineral soil
__label__0 this horizon is typically darkly colored because of the presence of organic matter
__label__1 soil bacteria  collectively called rhizobia  symbiotically interact with legume roots to form specialized structures called nodules  in which nitrogen fixation takes place
__label__0 this process entails the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia  by means of the enzyme nitrogenase
__label__0 an insectivorous plant has specialized leaves to attract and digest insects
__label__0 the venus flytrap is popularly known for its insectivorous mode of nutrition  and has leaves that work as traps   link
__label__0 the male gametophyte develops and reaches maturity in an immature anther
__label__0 in a plant s male reproductive organs  development of pollen takes place in a structure known as the microsporangium   link
__label__1 the microsporangia  which are usually bi  lobed  are pollen sacs in which the microspores develop into pollen grains
__label__0 the female cone also has a central axis on which bracts known as megasporophylls   link   are present
__label__0 in the female cone  megaspore mother cells are present in the megasporangium
__label__1 self  pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower  or another flower on the same plant
__label__1 cross  pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species
__label__0 self  pollination occurs in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time  and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower s stigma
__label__1 of the two sperm cells  one sperm fertilizes the egg cell  forming a diploid zygote  the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei  forming a triploid cell that develops into the endosperm
__label__0 together  these two fertilization events in angiosperms are known as double fertilization   link
__label__0 after fertilization is complete  no other sperm can enter
__label__0 the storage of food reserves in angiosperm seeds differs between monocots and dicots
__label__1 in monocots  such as corn and wheat  the single cotyledon is called a scutellum  the scutellum is connected directly to the embryo via vascular tissue  xylem and phloem
__label__0 food reserves are stored in the large endosperm
__label__0 tobacco  nicotiana tabaccum   tomato  solanum lycopersicum   and pepper  capsicum annuum  are examples of endospermic dicots
__label__0 in non  endospermic dicots  the triploid endosperm develops normally following double fertilization  but the endosperm food reserves are quickly remobilized and moved into the developing cotyledon for storage
__label__0 the two halves of a peanut seed  arachis hypogaea  and the split peas  pisum sativum  of split pea soup are individual cotyledons loaded with food reserves
__label__1 the portion of the embryo between the cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl  hypocotyl means  below the cotyledons
__label__1 the embryonic axis terminates in a radicle  the embryonic root   which is the region from which the root will develop
__label__0 in dicots  the hypocotyls extend above ground  giving rise to the stem of the plant
__label__0 forest fires also lead to the emergence of new seedlings
__label__1 some seeds require vernalization  cold treatment  before they can germinate
__label__0 this guarantees that seeds produced by plants in temperate climates will not germinate until the spring
__label__1 if the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary  it is known as a simple fruit  as seen in nuts and beans
__label__1 an aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel  but all are in the same flower  the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit  as seen in the raspberry
__label__1 multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers
__label__1 fruits generally have three parts  the exocarp  the outermost skin or covering   the mesocarp  middle part of the fruit   and the endocarp  the inner part of the fruit
__label__1 fruits generally have three parts  the exocarp  the outermost skin or covering   the mesocarp  middle part of the fruit   and the endocarp  the inner part of the fruit
__label__0 together  all three are known as the pericarp
__label__0 grafting has long been used to produce novel varieties of roses  citrus species  and other plants
__label__0 in grafting  two plant species are used  part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock
__label__1 the part that is grafted or attached is called the scion
__label__1 layering is a method in which a stem attached to the plant is bent and covered with soil
__label__0 young stems that can be bent easily without any injury are preferred
__label__0 soon after flowering  these plants die
__label__1 polycarpic plants form flowers many times during their lifetime
__label__0 fruit trees  such as apple and orange trees  are polycarpic  they flower every year
__label__1 limits on animal size and shapeanimals with bilateral symmetry that live in water tend to have a fusiform shape  this is a tubular shaped body that is tapered at both ends
__label__0 this shape decreases the drag on the body as it moves through water and allows the animal to swim at high speeds
__label__0 the insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur  fat  or feathers
__label__0 the absence of insulation in ectothermic animals increases their dependence on the environment for body heat
__label__1 a sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions
__label__1 a midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle  making two equal right and left halves
__label__1 a frontal plane  also called a coronal plane  separates the front from the back
__label__1 columnar epithelial cells are taller than they are wide  they resemble a stack of columns in an epithelial layer  and are most commonly found in a single  layer arrangement
__label__0 the nuclei of columnar epithelial cells in the digestive tract appear to be lined up at the base of the cells  as illustrated in  link
__label__1 connective tissuesconnective tissues are made up of a matrix consisting of living cells and a non  living substance  called the ground substance
__label__1 the ground substance is made of an organic substance  usually a protein  and an inorganic substance  usually a mineral or water
__label__1 fibrous connective tissues contain large amounts of collagen fibers and few cells or matrix material
__label__0 the fibers can be arranged irregularly or regularly with the strands lined up in parallel
__label__1 the cells  called chondrocytes  make the matrix and fibers of the tissue
__label__0 chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae
__label__0 chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae
__label__0 the wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi  they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells
__label__1 spongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength
__label__0 over time  these plates can break causing the bone to become less resilient
__label__0 any homeostatic process that changes the direction of the stimulus is a negative feedback loop
__label__0 it may either increase or decrease the stimulus  but the stimulus is not allowed to continue as it did before the receptor sensed it
__label__1 changes can be made in a group of body organ systems in order to maintain a set point in another system
__label__0 this is called acclimatization
__label__0 this occurs  for instance  when an animal migrates to a higher altitude than it is accustomed to
__label__1 carnivores are animals that eat other animals
__label__0 the word carnivore is derived from latin and literally means  meat eater
__label__0 wild cats such as lions  shown in  link  a and tigers are examples of vertebrate carnivores  as are snakes and sharks  while invertebrate carnivores include sea stars  spiders  and ladybugs  shown in  link  b
__label__1 the alimentary canal  shown in  link  b  is a more advanced system  it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other
__label__0 earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal
__label__1 ruminants are mainly herbivores like cows  sheep  and goats  whose entire diet consists of eating large amounts of roughage or fiber
__label__0 they have evolved digestive systems that help them digest vast amounts of cellulose
__label__0 the lingual lipase begins the breakdown of fat components in the food
__label__0 the chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the bolus for swallowing
__label__0 the tongue helps in swallowing  moving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx
__label__1 a ring  like muscle called a sphincter forms valves in the digestive system
__label__0 the gastro  esophageal sphincter is located at the stomach end of the esophagus
__label__0 contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles mixes the stomach contents about every  minutes
__label__1 the partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is called chyme
__label__0 chyme passes from the stomach to the small intestine
__label__1 the human small intestine is over  m long and is divided into three parts  the duodenum  the jejunum  and the ileum
__label__1 the  c  shaped   fixed part of the small intestine is called the duodenum and is shown in  link
__label__1 the duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum
__label__0 here  hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining
__label__0 the bulk of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum
__label__1 the ileum  also illustrated in  link  is the last part of the small intestine and here the bile salts and vitamins are absorbed into blood stream
__label__0 the undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle
__label__0 the feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination
__label__1 the anus is an opening at the far  end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material
__label__0 two sphincters between the rectum and anus control elimination  the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary
__label__1 the gallbladder is a small organ that aids the liver by storing bile and concentrating bile salts
__label__0 when chyme containing fatty acids enters the duodenum  the bile is secreted from the gallbladder into the duodenum
__label__0 both fat  soluble and water  soluble vitamins must be obtained from food
__label__1 minerals  listed in  link   are inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food
__label__0 among their many functions  minerals help in structure and regulation and are considered co  factors
__label__1 pancreatic juices also contain amylase  which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose  a disaccharide
__label__0 the disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides by enzymes called maltases  sucrases  and lactases  which are also present in the brush border of the small intestinal wall
__label__0 maltase breaks down maltose into glucose
__label__1 the long  chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive cells to form triglycerides  which aggregate into globules and become coated with proteins
__label__1 the long  chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive cells to form triglycerides  which aggregate into globules and become coated with proteins
__label__0 these large spheres are called chylomicrons
__label__0 chylomicrons contain triglycerides  cholesterol  and other lipids and have proteins on their surface
__label__0 the intestinal phase begins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions
__label__0 this phase controls the rate of gastric emptying
__label__0 gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid  or hydrochloric acid  hcl  which aids in the digestion of the proteins
__label__0 however  when the stomach is emptied  the acidic environment need not be maintained and a hormone called somatostatin stops the release of hydrochloric acid
__label__0 this is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism
__label__0 foods high in lipids take a long time to digest
__label__1 a hormone called gastric inhibitory peptide is secreted by the small intestine to slow down the peristaltic movements of the intestine to allow fatty foods more time to be digested and absorbed
__label__0 once a signal is received by the dendrite  it then travels passively to the cell body
__label__1 the cell body contains a specialized structure  the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon
__label__1 an axon is a tube  like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals
__label__1 along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath
__label__0 these gaps are called nodes of ranvier and are sites where the signal is  recharged  as it travels along the axon
__label__0 satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the pns
__label__1 microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms
__label__1 oligodendrocytes  shown in  link  b form myelin sheaths around axons in the cns
__label__0 this is distinctive from the pns where a single schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire schwann cell surrounds the axon
__label__1 radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations
__label__1 ependymal cells line fluid  filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord
__label__0 transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter
__label__1 transmission of a signal within a neuron  from dendrite to axon terminal  is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an action potential
__label__0 when neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron s dendrites  ion channels open
__label__0 as k ions leave the cell  the membrane potential once again becomes negative
__label__1 the diffusion of k out of the cell actually hyperpolarizes the cell  in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell s normal resting potential
__label__0 at this point  the sodium channels will return to their resting state  meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential
__label__1 fusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic membrane causes neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft  the extracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 the neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane
__label__1 signal summationsometimes a single epsp is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron  but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create epsps around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential
__label__0 this process is called summation and occurs at the axon hillock  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 additionally  one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons  some excitatory and some inhibitory  so ipsps can cancel out epsps and vice versa
__label__1 the central nervous system  cns  is made up of the brain  a part of which is shown in  link  and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges  from the greek word for membrane
__label__0 the outermost layer is the dura mater  latin for  hard mother
__label__0 the middle layer is the web  like arachnoid mater
__label__1 the last layer is the pia mater  latin for  soft mother    which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap
__label__0 the space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid  csf
__label__0 it includes the cerebral cortex  limbic system  basal ganglia  thalamus  hypothalamus  and cerebellum
__label__1 there are three different ways that a brain can be sectioned in order to view internal structures  a sagittal section cuts the brain left to right  as shown in  link  b  a coronal section cuts the brain front to back  as shown in  link  a  and a horizontal section cuts the brain top to bottom  cerebral cortexthe outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex  which is folded into hills called gyri  singular  gyrus  and valleys called sulci  singular  sulcus
__label__0 the cortex is made up of two hemispheres  right and left  which are separated by a large sulcus
__label__0 the parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain
__label__0 neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading
__label__1 the temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds
__label__1 it also contains the hippocampus  greek for  seahorse    a structure that processes memory formation
__label__1 the thalamus  greek for  inner chamber    illustrated in  link   acts as a gateway to and from the cortex
__label__0 it receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex
__label__0 it plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus
__label__1 one important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called the amygdala  greek for  almond    illustrated in  link
__label__0 the two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces
__label__1 the brainstem  illustrated in  link   connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord
__label__0 it consists of the midbrain  medulla oblongata  and the pons
__label__1 the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the  fight or flight  response that occurs when an animal encounters a dangerous situation
__label__0 one way to remember this is to think of the surprise a person feels when encountering a snake   snake  and  sympathetic  both begin with  s
__label__1 while the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations  the parasympathetic nervous system allows an animal to  rest and digest
__label__0 one way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation like a picnic  the parasympathetic nervous system is in control   picnic  and  parasympathetic  both start with  p
__label__0 parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral  toward the bottom  spinal cord  as shown in  link
__label__1 neurodegenerative disorders are illnesses characterized by a loss of nervous system functioning that are usually caused by neuronal death
__label__0 these diseases generally worsen over time as more and more neurons die
__label__1 autism spectrum disorder  asd  is a neurodevelopmental disorder
__label__0 its severity differs from person to person
__label__1 major depression affects approximately  percent of the adults in the united states each year and is one of the most common mental disorders
__label__0 to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder  a person must have experienced a severely depressed mood lasting longer than two weeks along with other symptoms including a loss of enjoyment in activities that were previously enjoyed  changes in appetite and sleep schedules  difficulty concentrating  feelings of worthlessness  and suicidal thoughts
__label__1 although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different  all share a common function  to convert a stimulus  such as light  or sound  or the position of the body  into an electrical signal in the nervous system
__label__0 this process is called sensory transduction  there are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction
__label__0 in one  a neuron works with a sensory receptor  a cell  or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus
__label__0 the receptor can then respond to the stimuli
__label__1 the region in space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus  be it far away or in contact with the body  is that receptor s receptive field
__label__0 think for a moment about the differences in receptive fields for the different senses
__label__1 perception is an individual s interpretation of a sensation
__label__0 although perception relies on the activation of sensory receptors  perception happens not at the level of the sensory receptor  but at higher levels in the nervous system  in the brain
__label__1 meissner s corpuscles   shown in  link   also known as tactile corpuscles  are found in the upper dermis  but they project into the epidermis
__label__0 they  too  are found primarily in the glabrous skin on the fingertips and eyelids
__label__0 neurons are not physically connected  but communicate via neurotransmitters secreted into synapses or  gaps  between communicating neurons
__label__0 once in the medulla  the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus
__label__1 muscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch  or lengthening of muscles
__label__1 related to these are golgi tendon organs  which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction
__label__1 audition  or hearing  is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions
__label__0 it enables an organism to detect and receive information about danger  such as an approaching predator  and to participate in communal exchanges like those concerning territories or mating
__label__1 in mammals  sound waves are collected by the external  cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna  then travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum  the innermost part of the outer ear  illustrated in  link
__label__1 interior to the tympanum is the middle ear
__label__0 the middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles  which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear
__label__0 the mechanical energy from the moving tympanum transmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear
__label__1 the stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window  which is the outermost structure of the inner ear
__label__1 the stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window  which is the outermost structure of the inner ear
__label__1 the structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth  a bony  hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear
__label__1 the cochlea is a whorled structure  like the shell of a snail  and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal  as illustrated in  link
__label__1 inside the cochlea  the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea  curling toward the cochlea s center
__label__1 the site of transduction is in the organ of corti  spiral organ
__label__0 it is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil  with their exposed short  hair  like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them
__label__0 the inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors and exist in a single row  numbering approximately
__label__0 wave amplitude is perceived as luminous intensity  or brightness
__label__1 the standard unit of intensity of light is the candela  which is approximately the luminous intensity of a one common candle
__label__1 the cornea  the front transparent layer of the eye  and the crystalline lens  a transparent convex structure behind the cornea  both refract  bend  light to focus the image on the retina
__label__1 the iris  which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye  is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye
__label__0 in conditions of high ambient light  the iris contracts  reducing the size of the pupil at its center
__label__0 for both defects  images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry
__label__1 myopia  nearsightedness  occurs when an eyeball is elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina
__label__0 in this case  images in the distance are blurry but images nearby are clear
__label__0 both rods and cones contain photopigments
__label__1 in vertebrates  the main photopigment  rhodopsin  has two main parts  link    an opsin  which is a membrane protein  in the form of a cluster of   helices that span the membrane   and retinal  a molecule that absorbs light
__label__0 when light hits a photoreceptor  it causes a shape change in the retinal  altering its structure from a bent  cis  form of the molecule to its linear  trans  isomer
__label__0 another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain  where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information
__label__0 finally  there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus  scn  of the hypothalamus
__label__1 the scn is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body s internal clock  which controls our circadian  day  long  cycle
__label__0 the first four tastes need little explanation
__label__0 the identification of umami as a fundamental taste occurred fairly recently  it was identified in  by japanese scientist kikunae ikeda while he worked with seaweed broth  but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later
__label__1 the taste of umami  also known as savoriness  is attributable to the taste of the amino acid l  glutamate
__label__0 recall that sensory cells are neurons
__label__1 an olfactory receptor  which is a dendrite of a specialized neuron  responds when it binds certain molecules inhaled from the environment by sending impulses directly to the olfactory bulb of the brain
__label__0 humans have about  million olfactory receptors  distributed among hundreds of different receptor types that respond to different odors
__label__1 the primary organ of taste is the taste bud
__label__1 a taste bud is a cluster of gustatory receptors  taste cells  that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae  singular  papilla   illustrated in  link
__label__0 a taste bud is a cluster of gustatory receptors  taste cells  that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae  singular  papilla   illustrated in  link
__label__0 there are several structurally distinct papillae
__label__0 most lipid hormones are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar to it  as illustrated in  link
__label__1 the primary class of lipid hormones in humans is the steroid hormones
__label__0 the structure of peptide hormones is that of a polypeptide chain  chain of amino acids
__label__0 the peptide hormones include molecules that are short polypeptide chains  such as antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin produced in the brain and released into the blood in the posterior pituitary gland
__label__1 in up  regulation  the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels  making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity
__label__1 when the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels  called down  regulation  cellular activity is reduced
__label__0 in this way  nothing passes through the cell membrane  the hormone that binds at the surface remains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains inside the cell
__label__1 the hormone that initiates the signaling pathway is called a first messenger  which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 in this way  a small amount of hormone can trigger the formation of a large amount of cellular product
__label__0 to stop hormone activity  camp is deactivated by the cytoplasmic enzyme phosphodiesterase  or pde
__label__1 pde is always present in the cell and breaks down camp to control hormone activity  preventing overproduction of cellular products  the specific response of a cell to a lipid insoluble hormone depends on the type of receptors that are present on the cell membrane and the substrate molecules present in the cell cytoplasm
__label__1 in some cases  the nervous system directly stimulates endocrine glands to release hormones  which is referred to as neural stimuli
__label__0 recall that in a short  term stress response  the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are important for providing the bursts of energy required for the body to respond
__label__1 the hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control  the pituitary gland  sometimes called the hypophysis or  master gland  is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica  a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull  illustrated in  link
__label__1 the hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control  the pituitary gland  sometimes called the hypophysis or  master gland  is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica  a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull  illustrated in  link
__label__0 it is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk  or infundibulum
__label__0 the anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release  inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus  and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus
__label__0 the posterior pituitary is significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary
__label__1 it is a part of the brain  extending down from the hypothalamus  and contains mostly nerve fibers and neuroglial cells  which support axons that extend from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary
__label__0 the thyroid gland is made up of many spherical thyroid follicles  which are lined with a simple cuboidal epithelium
__label__1 these follicles contain a viscous fluid  called colloid  which stores the glycoprotein thyroglobulin  the precursor to the thyroid hormones
__label__1 goods that are nonexcludable and rivalrous are called common resources
__label__0 because the waters of the caribbean are open to all conch fishermen  and because any conch that you catch is conch that i can not catch  common resources like the conch tend to be overharvested
__label__0 the current us poverty line is essentially the same as the orshansky poverty line  although the dollar amounts are adjusted each year to represent the same buying power over time
__label__0 the us poverty line in  ranged from   for a single individual to   for a household of four people
__label__0 link  shows the us poverty rate over time  that is  the percentage of the population below the poverty line in any given year
__label__0 the poverty rate declined through the s  rose in the early s and early s  but seems to have been slightly lower since the mid s
__label__0 a single mother  earning   an hour  with two children  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 first  consider the labor  leisure budget constraint faced by this family in a situation without government assistance
__label__0 on the horizontal axis is hours of leisure  or time spent with family responsibilities  increasing in quantity from right to left
__label__1 the us government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who have incomes just above the poverty line  who are referred to as the near  poor
__label__1 the us government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who have incomes just above the poverty line  who are referred to as the near  poor
__label__0 such programs are called the safety net  in recognition of the fact that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income
__label__0 snap participation increased by   between  and   from  million participants to  million
__label__0 according to the congressional budget office  this dramatic rise in participation was caused by the great recession of    and rising food prices
__label__0 the federal government deploys a range of income security programs that are funded through departments such as health and human services  agriculture  and housing and urban development  hud   see  link
__label__0 according to the office of management and budget  collectively  these three departments provided an estimated   billion of aid through programs such as supplemental feeding programs for women and children  subsidized housing  and energy assistance
__label__0 economists have focused their explanations for the increasing inequality on two factors that changed more or less continually from the s into the s
__label__0 one set of explanations focuses on the changing shape of american households  the other focuses on greater inequality of wages  what some economists call  winner take all  labor markets
__label__0 we will begin with how we measure inequality  and then consider the explanations for growing inequality in the united states
__label__1 measuring income distribution by quintilesone common way of measuring income inequality is to rank all households by income  from lowest to highest  and then to divide all households into five groups with equal numbers of people  known as quintiles
__label__1 the programs are paid for through the federal income tax  which is a progressive tax system designed in such a way that the rich pay a higher percent in income taxes than the poor
__label__0 data from household income tax returns in  shows that the top   of households had an average income of   per year in pre  tax income and paid an average federal tax rate of
__label__1 the united states does have an estate tax  that is  a tax imposed on the value of an inheritance  which suggests a willingness to limit how much wealth can be passed on as an inheritance
__label__0 however  according to the center on budget and policy priorities  in  the estate tax applied only to those leaving inheritances of more than   million and thus applies to only a tiny percentage of those with high levels of wealth
__label__0 what are the limits on how much higher pay they can receive
__label__0 to analyze these questions  let s consider a situation where all firms in an industry must negotiate with a single union  and no firm is allowed to hire nonunion labor
__label__0 if no labor union existed in this market  then equilibrium  e  in the labor market would occur at the intersection of the demand for labor  d  and the supply of labor  s  in  link
__label__0 in the past  presidential use of the taft  hartley act sometimes has made labor negotiations more bitter and argumentative but  in this case  it seems to have smoothed the road to an agreement  in other instances  unions have proved quite willing to adopt new technologies
__label__0 in one prominent example  during the s and s  the united mineworkers union demanded that mining companies install labor  saving machinery in the mines
__label__0 the mineworkers  union realized that over time  the new machines would reduce the number of jobs in the mines  but the union leaders also knew that the mine owners would have to pay higher wages if the workers became more productive  and mechanization was a necessary step toward greater productivity
__label__1 discrimination involves acting on the belief that members of a certain group are inferior solely because of a factor such as race  gender  or religion
__label__0 there are many types of discrimination but the focus here will be on discrimination in labor markets  which arises if workers with the same skill levels  as measured by education  experience  and expertise  receive different pay receive different pay or have different job opportunities because of their race or gender
__label__0 if some businesses run by bigoted employers refuse to pay women andor minorities a wage based on their productivity  then other profit  seeking employers can hire these workers
__label__0 in a competitive market  if the owners of a business care more about the color of money than about the color of skin  they will have an incentive to make buying  selling  hiring  and promotion decisions strictly based on economic factors
__label__0 supporters and opponents of immigration look at the same data and see different patterns
__label__0 those who express concern about immigration levels to the united states point to graphics like  link  which shows total inflows of immigrants decade by decade through the twentieth century
__label__0 clearly  the level of immigration has been high and rising in recent years  reaching and exceeding the towering levels of the early twentieth century
__label__0 the general rule is that all treatments to gemstones should be revealed  but often disclosure is not made
__label__1 as such  many buyers face a situation of asymmetric information  where the both parties involved in an economic transaction have an unequal amount of information  one party knows much more than the other
__label__0 for a market to reach equilibrium sellers and buyers must have full information about the product s price and quality
__label__0 if there is limited information  then buyers and sellers may not be able to transact or will possibly make poor decisions
__label__0 when buyers use the market price to draw inferences about the quality of products  then markets may have trouble reaching an equilibrium price and quantity
__label__0 imagine a situation where a used car dealer has a lot full of used cars that do not seem to be selling  and so the dealer decides to cut the prices of the cars to sell a greater quantity
__label__1 in the goods market  the seller of a good might offer a money  back guarantee  an agreement that functions as a promise of quality
__label__0 this strategy may be especially important for a company that sells goods through mail  order catalogs or over the web  whose customers can not see the actual products  because it encourages people to buy something even if they are not certain they want to keep it
__label__0 sellers of labor provide information through resumes  recommendations  school transcripts  and examples of their work
__label__0 occupational licenses are also used to establish quality in the labor market
__label__1 occupational licenses  which are typically issued by government agencies  show that a worker has completed a certain type of education or passed a certain test
__label__0 in the financial capital market  before a bank makes a loan  it requires a prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income  in addition  the bank conducts a credit check on the individual s past borrowing
__label__1 another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan  that is  another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so
__label__1 yet another approach is to require collateral  often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid
__label__1 pension insurance  employers that offer pensions to their retired employees are required by law to pay a small fraction of what they are setting aside for pensions to the pension benefit guarantee corporation  which is used to pay at least some pension benefits to workers if a company goes bankrupt and can not pay the pensions it has promised
__label__1 retirement insurance  all workers pay a percentage of their income into social security and into medicare  which then provides income and health care benefits to the elderly
__label__0 social security and medicare are not literally  insurance  in the sense that those currently contributing to the fund are not eligible for benefits
__label__0 another method to reduce moral hazard is to require the injured party to pay a share of the costs
__label__1 for example  insurance policies often have deductibles  which is an amount that the insurance policyholder must pay out of their own pocket before the insurance coverage starts paying
__label__0 for example  auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than
__label__0 a final way of reducing moral hazard  which is especially applicable to health care  is to focus on the incentives of providers of health care  rather than consumers
__label__1 traditionally  most health care in the united states has been provided on a fee  for  service basis  which means that medical care providers are paid for the services they provide and are paid more if they provide additional services
__label__0 however  in the last decade or so  the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations  hmos
__label__0 the affordable care act  aca  will be funded through additional taxes to include
__label__0 firms often make decisions that involve spending money in the present and expecting to earn profits in the future
__label__0 examples include when a firm buys a machine that will last  years  or builds a new plant that will last for  years  or starts a research and development project
__label__0 firms can raise the financial capital they need to pay for such projects in four main ways     from early  stage investors     by reinvesting profits     by borrowing through banks or bonds  and    by selling stock
__label__0 in this way  an individual investor could  in effect  loan the firm    or any multiple of that amount
__label__1 anyone who owns a bond and receives the interest payments is called a bondholder
__label__0 if a firm issues bonds and fails to make the promised interest payments  the bondholders can take the firm to court and require it to pay  even if the firm needs to raise the money by selling buildings or equipment
__label__0 those who buy the stock become the owners  or shareholders  of the firm
__label__1 stock represents ownership of a firm  that is  a person who owns   of a company s stock  by definition  owns the entire company
__label__0 the stock of a company is divided into shares
__label__0 that rate of return can come in two forms
__label__1 a firm can make a direct payment to its shareholders  called a dividend
__label__0 alternatively  a financial investor might buy a share of stock in wal  mart for   and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for    for a gain of
__label__0 a private company is owned by the people who run it on a day  to  day basis
__label__1 a private company can be run by individuals  in which case it is called a sole proprietorship  or it can be run by a group  in which case it is a partnership
__label__0 a private company can also be a corporation  but with no publicly issued stock
__label__0 a high  risk investment will have actual returns that are much higher than the expected rate of return in some months or years and much lower in other months or years
__label__1 the actual rate of return refers to the total rate of return  including capital gains and interest paid on an investment at the end of a period of time
__label__1 a checking account typically pays little or no interest  but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money  either by writing a check or by using a debit card  that is  a card which works like a credit card  except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company
__label__1 a checking account typically pays little or no interest  but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money  either by writing a check or by using a debit card  that is  a card which works like a credit card  except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company
__label__1 a savings account typically pays some interest rate  but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine  or you can access the funds electronically
__label__0 the lines between checking and savings accounts have blurred in the last couple of decades  as many banks offer checking accounts that will pay an interest rate similar to a savings account if you keep a certain minimum amount in the account  or conversely  offer savings accounts that allow you to write at least a few checks per month
__label__0 firms that appear to be riskier borrowers  perhaps because they are still growing or their businesses appear shaky  will pay the highest interest rates when they issue bonds
__label__1 bonds that offer high interest rates to compensate for their relatively high chance of default are called high yield bonds or junk bonds
__label__0 a number of today s well  known firms issued junk bonds in the s when they were starting to grow  including turner broadcasting and microsoft
__label__0 bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that were clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest
__label__1 the bond has a maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment
__label__0 combining the bond s face value  interest rate  and maturity date  and market interest rates  allows a buyer to compute a bond s present value  which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond
__label__0 link  shows bond yield for two kinds of bonds   year treasury bonds  which are officially called  notes   and corporate bonds issued by firms that have been given an aaa rating as relatively safe borrowers by moody s  an independent firm that publishes such ratings
__label__0 even though corporate bonds pay a higher interest rate  because firms are riskier borrowers than the federal government  the rates tend to rise and fall together
__label__0 purchasing a diversified group of the stocks or bonds has gotten easier in the internet age  but it remains something of a task
__label__1 to simplify the process  companies offer mutual funds  which are organizations that buy a range of stocks or bonds from different companies
__label__0 the financial investor buys shares of the mutual fund  and then receives a return based on how the fund as a whole performs
__label__0 the chief problem with attempting to buy stock in companies that will have higher prices in the future is that many other financial investors are trying to do the same thing
__label__0 thus  in attempting to get rich in the stock market  it is no help to identify a company that is going to earn high profits if many other investors have already reached the same conclusion  because the stock price will already be high  based on the expected high level of future profits  the idea that stock prices are based on expectations about the future has a powerful and unexpected implication
__label__0 for example  many us drivers do not much care where the tires for their car were made  they just want good quality as inexpensively as they can get it
__label__1 in september   president obama and congress enacted a tariff  taxes added on imported goods  on tires imported from china that would increase the import price of chinese tires by  percent in its first year   percent in its second year  and  percent in its third year
__label__0 interestingly  the us companies that make tires did not favor this step  because most of them also import tires from china and other countries
__label__0 as this example suggests  we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in environmental protection and negative externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution  the problem called regulatory capture  which we defined in monopoly and antitrust policy
__label__0 in legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes  or rules for safety in the workplace  or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations  you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma
__label__0 they talk with the legislators who are writing the legislation and suggest alternative wording
__label__0 politicians have an incentive to ensure that government money is spent in their home state or district  where it will benefit their constituents in a direct and obvious way
__label__1 thus  when legislators are negotiating over whether to support a piece of legislation  they commonly ask each other to include pork  barrel spending  legislation that benefits mainly a single political district
__label__0 pork  barrel spending is another case in which democracy is challenged by concentrated benefits and widely dispersed costs  the benefits of pork  barrel spending are obvious and direct to local voters  while the costs are spread over the entire country
__label__0 does the majority view prevail in the case of sugar quotas
__label__0 clearly there are more sugar consumers in the united states than sugar producers  but the us domestic sugar lobby  wwwsugarcaneorg  has successfully argued for protection against imports since
__label__0 when a firm produces a product no one wants to buy or produces at a higher cost than its competitors  the firm is likely to suffer losses
__label__0 if it can not change its ways  it will go out of business
__label__0 as you learn in the micro part of this book  principal tools used by economists are theories and models  see welcome to economics
__label__0 for more on this
__label__0 in microeconomics  we used the theories of supply and demand  in macroeconomics  we use the theories of aggregate demand  ad  and aggregate supply  as
__label__0 this book presents two perspectives on macroeconomics  the neoclassical perspective and the keynesian perspective  each of which has its own version of ad and as
__label__1 investment expenditure refers to purchases of physical plant and equipment  primarily by businesses
__label__0 if starbucks builds a new store  or amazon buys robots  these expenditures are counted under business investment
__label__0 everything that is purchased must be produced first
__label__0 link  breaks down what is produced into five categories  durable goods  nondurable goods  services  structures  and the change in inventories
__label__0 before going into detail about these categories  notice that total gdp measured according to what is produced is exactly the same as the gdp measured by looking at the five components of demand
__label__1 net national product  nnp  is calculated by taking gnp and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out  or reduced in value because of aging  over the course of a year
__label__1 the process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation
__label__1 the nnp can be further subdivided into national income  which includes all income to businesses and individuals  and personal income  which includes only income to people
__label__1 the nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time
__label__1 the real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation
__label__0 generally  it is the real value that is more important
__label__0 because  is the base year  the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year
__label__0 however  over time  the rise in nominal gdp looks much larger than the rise in real gdp  that is  the nominal gdp line rises more steeply than the real gdp line   because the rise in nominal gdp is exaggerated by the presence of inflation  especially in the s  us
__label__0 nominal and real gdp
__label__0 the red line measures us gdp in nominal dollars
__label__1 an especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression
__label__0 the severe drop in gdp that occurred during the great depression of the s is clearly visible in the figure  as is the great recession of
__label__0 a private think tank  the national bureau of economic research  nber   is the official tracker of business cycles for the us economy
__label__0 however  the effects of a severe recession often linger on after the official ending date assigned by the nber
__label__0 key concepts and summary
__label__0 so is the us economy larger than other countries just because the united states has more people than most other countries  or because the us economy is actually larger on a per  person basis
__label__1 this question can be answered by calculating a country s gdp per capita  that is  the gdp divided by the population
__label__0 gdp has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society
__label__0 gdp per capita is only an average
__label__0 when gdp per capita rises by    it could mean that gdp for everyone in the society has risen by    or that of some groups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less  or even declined
__label__0 according to the dutch economic historian jan luiten van zanden  slavery  based societies  favorable demographics  global trading routes  and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the industrial revolution to succeed
__label__1 the industrial revolution refers to the widespread use of power  driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the s
__label__0 ingenious machines  the steam engine  the power loom  and the steam locomotive  performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do
__label__0 in other words  how efficient is your nation with its time and workers
__label__1 labor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input
__label__0 the easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a canadian worker who can make  loaves of bread in an hour versus a us worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread
__label__1 to analyze the sources of economic growth  it is useful to think about a production function  which is the process of turning economic inputs like labor  machinery  and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers
__label__0 a microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm  or perhaps an industry
__label__0 it causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time
__label__1 similarly  compound rates of economic growth  or the compound growth rate  means that the rate of growth is being multiplied by a base that includes past gdp growth  with dramatic effects over time
__label__0 it may not make sense to compare the gdps of china and say  benin  simply because of the great difference in population size
__label__0 to understand economic growth  which is really concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person  it is often useful to focus on gdp per capita
__label__0 using gdp per capita also makes it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of people  like belgium  uruguay  or zimbabwe  with countries that have larger populations  like the united states  the russian federation  or nigeria
__label__0 special economic zones
__label__0 the island of mauritius is one of the few african nations to encourage international trade in government  supported special economic zones  sez
__label__1 these are areas of the country  usually with access to a port where  among other benefits  the government does not tax trade
__label__0 a first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns
__label__1 even though deepening human and physical capital will tend to increase gdp per capita  the law of diminishing returns suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and physical capital  the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish
__label__0 for example  raising the average education level of the population by two years from a tenth  grade level to a high school diploma  while holding all other inputs constant  would produce a certain increase in output
__label__0 an economy with high unemployment is like a company operating with a functional but unused factory
__label__0 the opportunity cost of unemployment is the output that could have been produced by the unemployed workers
__label__0 they are  however  also counted in the employed group
__label__1 all of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term  hidden unemployment   discouraged workers  those who have stopped looking for employment and  hence  are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group
__label__0 the timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and downswings in the overall economy
__label__0 during periods of recession and depression  unemployment is high
__label__0 during periods of economic growth  unemployment tends to be lower
__label__1 the variation in unemployment caused by the economy moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion  ie
__label__0 the business cycle  is known as cyclical unemployment
__label__0 one set of reasons why wages may be  sticky downward   as economists put it  involves economic laws and institutions
__label__0 for low  skilled workers being paid the minimum wage  it is illegal to reduce their wages
__label__0 for union workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company  wage cuts might violate the contract and create a labor dispute or a strike
__label__1 efficiency wage theory argues that the productivity of workers depends on their pay  and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate
__label__0 one reason is that employees who are paid better than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they were to lose their current jobs  they would suffer a decline in salary
__label__1 the insider  outsider model of the labor force  in simple terms  argues that those already working for firms are  insiders   while new employees  at least for a time  are  outsiders
__label__0 a firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization  to be familiar with routine procedures  to train new employees  and so on
__label__0 however  cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm s productivity and prospects
__label__1 finally  the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline  there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan
__label__0 instead  workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage cut  and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others
__label__0 but in the real world  even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies  it takes time to find out about new jobs  to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match  or perhaps to sell a house and buy another in proximity to a new job
__label__1 the unemployment that occurs in the meantime  as workers move between jobs  is called frictional unemployment
__label__0 frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad thing
__label__1 inflation is a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy
__label__0 inflation does not refer to a change in relative prices
__label__0 to calculate the price level  economists begin with the concept of a basket of goods and services  consisting of the different items individuals  businesses  or organizations typically buy
__label__0 the next step is to look at how the prices of those items change over time
__label__1 price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time
__label__0 to convert the money spent on the basket to an index number  economists arbitrarily choose one year to be the base year  or starting point from which we measure changes in prices
__label__0 the base year  by definition  has an index number equal to
__label__0 a fixed and unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods  regardless of price changes  not a very likely assumption
__label__1 thus  substitution bias  the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time  tends to overstate the rise in a consumer s true cost of living  because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen
__label__0 the bls also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods
__label__1 for example  the producer price index  ppi  is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and services
__label__0 it can be broken down into price indices for different industries  commodities  and stages of processing  like finished goods  intermediate goods  crude materials for further processing  and so on
__label__0 an employment cost index measures wage inflation in the labor market
__label__1 the gdp deflator  measured by the bureau of economic analysis  is a price index that includes all the components of gdp  that is  consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports
__label__0 unlike the cpi  its baskets are not fixed but re  calculate what that year s gdp would have been worth using the base  year s prices
__label__0 inflation in china averaged about   per year for much of the s and early s  although it has dropped off since then
__label__1 russia experienced hyperinflation  an outburst of high inflation  of   per year in the early s  although by  russia s consumer price inflation had dipped below   per year  as shown in  link
__label__0 the closest the united states has ever gotten to hyperinflation was during the civil war      in the confederate states
__label__0 countries with relatively high inflation rates
__label__0 these charts show the percentage change in consumer prices compared with the previous year s consumer prices in brazil  china  and russia
__label__0 economists note that over most periods  the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in wages  and so they reason that  on average  over time  people s economic status is not greatly changed by inflation
__label__0 if all prices  wages  and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation  as in the land of funny money  then no one s purchasing power  profits  or real loan payments would change
__label__0 moreover  the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful  prolonged conflicts between employers and employees
__label__0 if the minimum wage is adjusted for inflation only infrequently  minimum wage workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages  as shown in  link
__label__0 us minimum wage and inflation after adjusting for inflation  the federal minimum wage dropped more than  percent from  to   even though the nominal figure climbed from   to   per hour
__label__0 prices are the messengers in a market economy  conveying information about conditions of demand and supply
__label__0 inflation blurs those price messages
__label__0 second  an argument is sometimes made that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor markets more flexible
__label__0 the discussion in unemployment pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their downward movements and that unemployment can result
__label__1 in the s and s  labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that had cost  of  living adjustments  colas  which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with inflation
__label__0 these contracts were sometimes written as  for example  cola plus
__label__0 also  social security is funded by payroll taxes  which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount    in
__label__0 this level of income is adjusted upward each year according to the rate of inflation  so that the indexed rise in the benefit level is accompanied by an indexed increase in the social security tax base
__label__0 as yet another example of a government program affected by indexing  in  the us  government began offering indexed bonds
__label__1 bonds are means by which the us government  and many private  sector companies as well  borrows money  that is  investors buy the bonds  and then the government repays the money with interest
__label__0 recall from the macroeconomic perspective that if exports exceed imports  the economy is said to have a trade surplus
__label__1 if imports exceed exports  the economy is said to have a trade deficit
__label__0 if exports and imports are equal  then trade is balanced
__label__0 old habits are hard to break
__label__0 economists  however  typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the current account balance which includes other international flows of income and foreign aid
__label__0 the second row of  link  provides data on trade in services
__label__0 here  the us economy is running a surplus
__label__0 although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods  the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades
__label__0 some of the other countries listed include brazil  the largest economy in latin america  nigeria  the largest economy in africa  and china  india  and korea
__label__0 the first column offers one measure of the globalization of an economy  exports of goods and services as a percentage of gdp
__label__0 the second column shows the trade balance
__label__0 the connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that the balance of trade is sometimes described as the balance of payments
__label__0 each category of the current account balance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy
__label__0 the national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance
__label__0 in a nation s financial capital market  the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments
__label__0 what is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital
__label__0 for most years of the nineteenth century  us imports exceeded exports and the us economy had a trade deficit
__label__0 yet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all  instead  the trade deficits contributed to the strong economic growth that gave the us economy the highest per capita gdp in the world by around
__label__0 the balance of trade is a separate issue from the level of trade
__label__0 the united states has a low level of trade  but had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid s into the s
__label__0 those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous french economist of the early nineteenth century named jean  baptiste say
__label__0 say s law is   supply creates its own demand
__label__0 as a matter of historical accuracy  it seems clear that say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs  but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view
__label__1 the intuition behind say s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold  it generates income that is earned for someone  a worker  a manager  an owner  or those who are workers  managers  and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production
__label__0 to be sure  even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand  the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses
__label__0 nevertheless  a recession is not a situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes
__label__1 a recession is a situation in which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size  business failures outnumber the remaining success stories  and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers
__label__0 the carotenoids found in fruit  such as the red of tomato  lycopene   the yellow of corn seeds  zeaxanthin   or the orange of an orange peel    carotene   are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers
__label__0 in photosynthesis  carotenoids function as photosynthetic pigments that are very efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy
__label__0 when a leaf is exposed to full sun  the light  dependent reactions are required to process an enormous amount of energy  if that energy is not handled properly  it can do significant damage
__label__0 each photosystem is serviced by the light  harvesting complex  which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center  it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of    chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids
__label__0 the absorption of a single photon or distinct quantity or  packet  of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state
__label__0 in short  the light energy has now been captured by biological molecules but is not stored in any useful form yet
__label__1 the reaction center of psii  called p  delivers its high  energy electrons  one at the time  to the primary electron acceptor  and through the electron transport chain  pq to cytochrome complex to plastocyanine  to psi
__label__0 p s missing electron is replaced by extracting a low  energy electron from water  thus  water is split and psii is re  reduced after every photoact
__label__1 the number of carbon atoms remains the same  as the atoms move to form new bonds during the reactions   atoms from  co   atoms from  rubp   atoms in  atoms of pga
__label__0 this process is called carbon fixation  because co is  fixed  from an inorganic form into organic molecules
__label__1 communication between cells is called intercellular signaling  and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling
__label__0 an easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the latin origin of the prefixes  inter means
__label__0 chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small  usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands
__label__1 a ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule  in some cases  delivering a signal in the process
__label__1 signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals
__label__0 paracrine signals move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix
__label__0 when these impulses reach the end of the axon  the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell  the cell emitting the signal
__label__1 the neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells  which are called chemical synapses   link
__label__0 the small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly  this enables an immediate response  such as  take your hand off the stove
__label__1 gap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants are connections between the plasma membranes of neighboring cells
__label__0 these water  filled channels allow small signaling molecules  called intracellular mediators  to diffuse between the two cells
__label__0 small molecules  such as calcium ions  ca    are able to move between cells  but large molecules like proteins and dna can not fit through the channels
__label__0 each cell  surface receptor has three main components  an external ligand  binding domain  a hydrophobic membrane  spanning region  and an intracellular domain inside the cell
__label__0 the ligand  binding domain is also called the extracellular domain
__label__0 the size and extent of each of these domains vary widely  depending on the type of receptor
__label__1 enzyme  linked receptors are cell  surface receptors with intracellular domains that are associated with an enzyme
__label__0 in some cases  the intracellular domain of the receptor itself is an enzyme
__label__1 in some cases  binding of the ligand causes dimerization of the receptor  which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer
__label__1 a dimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules  often identical  join together
__label__0 the binding of the receptors in this manner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other
__label__0 phosphates are also often added to serine  threonine  and tyrosine residues of proteins  where they replace the hydroxyl group of the amino acid   link
__label__1 the transfer of the phosphate is catalyzed by an enzyme called a kinase
__label__0 various kinases are named for the substrate they phosphorylate
__label__0 cyclic amp is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from atp   link
__label__0 the main role of camp in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme called camp  dependent kinase  a  kinase
__label__1 a  kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways  it phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins  activating them in the process
__label__0 the second kind of protein with which pkc can interact is a protein that acts as an inhibitor
__label__1 an inhibitor is a molecule that binds to a protein and prevents it from functioning or reduces its function
__label__0 in this case  the inhibitor is a protein called i  b  which binds to the regulatory protein nf  b
__label__0 inside the cell  many different enzymes reverse the cellular modifications that result from signaling cascades
__label__1 for example  phosphatases are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called dephosphorylation
__label__0 cyclic amp  camp  is degraded into amp by phosphodiesterase  and the release of calcium stores is reversed by the ca pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell
__label__0 when the population density of the bacteria reaches a certain level  specific gene expression is initiated  and the bacteria produce bioluminescent proteins that emit light
__label__1 because the number of cells present in the environment  cell density  is the determining factor for signaling  bacterial signaling was named quorum sensing
__label__1 in politics and business  a quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present to vote on an issue
__label__0 before discussing the steps a cell must undertake to replicate  a deeper understanding of the structure and function of a cell s genetic information is necessary
__label__1 a cell s dna  packaged as a double  stranded dna molecule  is called its genome
__label__0 in prokaryotes  the genome is composed of a single  double  stranded dna molecule in the form of a loop or circle   link
__label__0 the letter n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes  therefore  a diploid organism is designated n
__label__1 human cells that contain one set of chromosomes are called gametes  or sex cells  these are eggs and sperm  and are designated n  or haploid
__label__0 there are  pairs of homologous chromosomes in a female human somatic cell
__label__1 the condensed chromosomes are viewed within the nucleus  top   removed from a cell in mitosis and spread out on a slide  right   and artificially arranged according to length  left   an arrangement like this is called a karyotype
__label__1 in the first level of compaction  short stretches of the dna double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome   link
__label__0 the dna  histone complex is called chromatin
__label__0 when fully compact  the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins
__label__1 the connection between the sister chromatids is closest in a region called the centromere
__label__0 the conjoined sister chromatids  with a diameter of about  m  are visible under a light microscope
__label__1 during interphase  the cell grows and dna is replicated
__label__1 during the mitotic phase  the replicated dna and cytoplasmic contents are separated  and the cell divides
__label__1 the centrosome is duplicated during the s phase
__label__1 the two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle  the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis
__label__1 at the center of each animal cell  the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod  like objects  the centrioles  which are at right angles to each other
__label__1 the mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned  separated  and move into two new  identical daughter cells
__label__1 the first portion of the mitotic phase is called karyokinesis  or nuclear division
__label__1 the second portion of the mitotic phase  called cytokinesis  is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into the two daughter cells
__label__0 link to learning
__label__0 microtubules that will form the mitotic spindle extend between the centrosomes  pushing them farther apart as the microtubule fibers lengthen
__label__0 the sister chromatids begin to coil more tightly with the aid of condensin proteins and become visible under a light microscope
__label__1 during metaphase  the  change phase   all the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the metaphase plate  or the equatorial plane  midway between the two poles of the cell
__label__0 the sister chromatids are still tightly attached to each other by cohesin proteins
__label__1 cytokinesis  or  cell motion   is the second main stage of the mitotic phase during which cell division is completed via the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells
__label__0 division is not complete until the cell components have been apportioned and completely separated into the two daughter cells
__label__0 not all cells adhere to the classic cell cycle pattern in which a newly formed daughter cell immediately enters the preparatory phases of interphase  closely followed by the mitotic phase
__label__0 cells in g phase are not actively preparing to divide
__label__1 the cell is in a quiescent  inactive  stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle
__label__1 the genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto  oncogenes
__label__1 proto  oncogenes are normal genes that  when mutated in certain ways  become oncogenes  genes that cause a cell to become cancerous
__label__0 consider what might happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene
__label__1 two groups of proteins  called cyclins and cyclin  dependent kinases  cdks   are responsible for the progress of the cell through the various checkpoints
__label__0 the levels of the four cyclin proteins fluctuate throughout the cell cycle in a predictable pattern   link
__label__0 the packing proteins of bacteria are  however  related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes  the bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell
__label__1 the starting point of replication  the origin  is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane   link
__label__0 replication of the dna is bidirectional  moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously
__label__1 sexual reproduction requires fertilization  the union of two cells from two individual organisms
__label__0 if those two cells each contain one set of chromosomes  then the resulting cell contains two sets of chromosomes
__label__1 during dna duplication in the s phase  each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical copies  called sister chromatids  that are held together at the centromere by cohesin proteins
__label__1 during dna duplication in the s phase  each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical copies  called sister chromatids  that are held together at the centromere by cohesin proteins
__label__0 cohesin holds the chromatids together until anaphase ii
__label__1 the synaptonemal complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between non  sister homologous chromatids  a process called crossing over
__label__0 crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange as chiasmata  singular  chiasma    link
__label__0 in species such as humans  even though the x and y sex chromosomes are not homologous  most of their genes differ   they have a small region of homology that allows the x and y chromosomes to pair up during prophase i
__label__0 a partial synaptonemal complex develops only between the regions of homology
__label__0 following crossover  the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is also removed
__label__1 at the end of prophase i  the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata   link   and are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible
__label__0 fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles
__label__0 what happens between these two events depends on the organism
__label__0 species with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life cycle
__label__1 the haploid multicellular plants are called gametophytes  because they produce gametes from specialized cells
__label__0 meiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case  because the organism that produces the gametes is already a haploid
__label__0 in   he published his work  experiments in plant hybridization   in the proceedings of the natural history society of brnn
__label__0 mendel s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community that believed  incorrectly  that the process of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring  this hypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation
__label__1 continuous variation results from the action of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height
__label__0 offspring appear to be a  blend  of their parents  traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation
__label__1 mendel performed hybridizations  which involve mating two true  breeding individuals that have different traits
__label__0 in the pea  which is naturally self  pollinating  this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety
__label__0 once mendel examined the characteristics in the f generation of plants  he allowed them to self  fertilize naturally
__label__0 he then collected and grew the seeds from the f plants to produce the f  or second filial  generation
__label__0 mendel s experiments extended beyond the f generation to the f and f generations  and so on  but it was the ratio of characteristics in the p  f  f generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis for mendel s postulates  in one of his experiments on inheritance patterns  mendel crossed plants that were true  breeding for violet flower color with plants true  breeding for white flower color  the p generation
__label__0 he called these  respectively  dominant and recessive traits
__label__1 dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization
__label__1 recessive traits become latent  or disappear  in the offspring of a hybridization
__label__0 on the other hand  the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come about by more than one pathway
__label__1 the sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event  of two mutually exclusive events  is the sum of their individual probabilities
__label__1 the observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype
__label__1 an organism s underlying genetic makeup  consisting of both physically visible and non  expressed alleles  is called its genotype
__label__0 mendel s hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype
__label__1 when fertilization occurs between two true  breeding parents that differ in only one characteristic  the process is called a monohybrid cross  and the resulting offspring are monohybrids
__label__1 when fertilization occurs between two true  breeding parents that differ in only one characteristic  the process is called a monohybrid cross  and the resulting offspring are monohybrids
__label__0 mendel performed seven monohybrid crosses involving contrasting traits for each characteristic
__label__0 of course  doing a test cross in humans is unethical and impractical
__label__0 instead  geneticists use pedigree analysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases   link
__label__0 although individual humans  and all diploid organisms  can only have two alleles for a given gene  multiple alleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed
__label__1 note that when many alleles exist for the same gene  the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type  often abbreviated      this is considered the standard or norm
__label__0 all other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard  meaning that they deviate from the wild type
__label__0 although the y chromosome contains a small region of similarity to the x chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis  the y chromosome is much shorter and contains many fewer genes
__label__1 when a gene being examined is present on the x chromosome  but not on the y chromosome  it is said to be x  linked
__label__0 for instance  the recessive lethal curly allele in drosophila affects wing shape in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the homozygote
__label__0 a single copy of the wild  type allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival
__label__1 the dominant lethal inheritance pattern is one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote  this allele can only be transmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age
__label__0 individuals with mutations that result in dominant lethal alleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form
__label__1 mendel s law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes  and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur
__label__0 the independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross  a cross between two true  breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics
__label__1 in epistasis  the interaction between genes is antagonistic  such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of another
__label__0 epistasis  is a word composed of greek roots that mean  standing upon
__label__0 the alleles that are being masked or silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking
__label__1 if the genes are unlinked  the individual should produce ab  ab  ab  and ab gametes with equal frequencies  according to the mendelian concept of independent assortment
__label__1 because they correspond to new allele combinations  the genotypes ab and ab are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis
__label__1 parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents
__label__0 such a result would indicate that the genes were definitively linked  but that they were far enough apart for crossovers to occasionally occur
__label__1 sturtevant divided his genetic map into map units  or centimorgans  cm   in which a recombination frequency of  corresponds to  cmby representing alleles in a linear map  sturtevant suggested that genes can range from being perfectly linked  recombination frequency    to being perfectly unlinked  recombination frequency    when genes are on different chromosomes or genes are separated very far apart on the same chromosome
__label__0 perfectly unlinked genes correspond to the frequencies predicted by mendel to assort independently in a dihybrid cross
__label__0 in a given species  chromosomes can be identified by their number  size  centromere position  and banding pattern
__label__1 in a human karyotype  autosomes or  body chromosomes   all of the non  sex chromosomes  are generally organized in approximate order of size from largest  chromosome   to smallest  chromosome
__label__0 the x and y chromosomes are not autosomes
__label__1 an individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid  in humans  euploidy corresponds to  pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes
__label__1 an individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid  a term that includes monosomy  loss of one chromosome  or trisomy  gain of an extraneous chromosome
__label__0 rather than a gain or loss of autosomes  variations in the number of sex chromosomes are associated with relatively mild effects
__label__0 in part  this occurs because of a molecular process called x inactivation
__label__1 early in development  when female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells  relative to trillions in the newborn   one x chromosome in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into a quiescent  dormant  structure called a barr body
__label__1 a translocation occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different  nonhomologous chromosome
__label__0 translocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered with respect to regulatory sequences
__label__0 the origin of replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site
__label__1 an enzyme called helicase unwinds the dna by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs
__label__0 atp hydrolysis is required for this process
__label__0 the problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free    oh end
__label__1 another enzyme  rna primase  synthesizes an rna primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the dna
__label__0 because this sequence primes the dna synthesis  it is appropriately called the primer
__label__0 this continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand
__label__1 the other strand  complementary to the   to   parental dna  is extended away from the replication fork  in small fragments known as okazaki fragments  each requiring a primer to start the synthesis
__label__0 okazaki fragments are named after the japanese scientist who first discovered them
__label__1 the sliding clamp is a ring  shaped protein that binds to the dna and holds the polymerase in place
__label__1 topoisomerase prevents the over  winding of the dna double helix ahead of the replication fork as the dna is opening up  it does so by causing temporary nicks in the dna helix and then resealing it
__label__0 as synthesis proceeds  the rna primers are replaced by dna
__label__1 some errors are not corrected during replication  but are instead corrected after replication is completed  this type of repair is known as mismatch repair   link
__label__0 the enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it  this is then replaced by the correct base
__label__0 such mutations may be of two types  induced or spontaneous
__label__1 induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals  uv rays  x  rays  or some other environmental agent
__label__1 spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent  they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body
__label__1 some mutations are not expressed  these are known as silent mutations
__label__1 point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair
__label__1 the most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions  in which one base is replaced by another
__label__1 the ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres  which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene
__label__0 in a way  these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide
__label__0 the translation to protein is a bit more complex because three mrna nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence
__label__0 however  the translation to protein is still systematic and colinear  such that nucleotides  to  correspond to amino acid   nucleotides  to  correspond to amino acid   and so on
__label__0 instructions on dna are transcribed onto messenger rna
__label__1 ribosomes are able to read the genetic information inscribed on a strand of messenger rna and use this information to string amino acids together into a protein
__label__1 these nucleotide triplets are called codons
__label__0 the insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame  thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid   link
__label__0 though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation  the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained
__label__0 plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance  transcription in prokaryotes  and in eukaryotes  requires the dna double helix to partially unwind in the region of mrna synthesis
__label__1 the region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble
__label__1 transcription always proceeds from the same dna strand for each gene  which is called the template strand
__label__1 the mrna product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other dna strand  called the nontemplate strand
__label__1 the nucleotide pair in the dna double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first   mrna nucleotide is transcribed is called the  site  or the initiation site
__label__0 nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream
__label__1 conversely  nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with    numbering and are called downstream nucleotides
__label__0 without   the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce mrna molecules that specified protein gibberish
__label__1 the polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the holoenzyme
__label__0 one is protein  based and the other is rna  based
__label__1 rho  dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein  which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mrna chain
__label__0 near the end of the gene  the polymerase encounters a run of g nucleotides on the dna template and it stalls
__label__0 rna polymerase iii is also located in the nucleus
__label__0 this polymerase transcribes a variety of structural rnas that includes the s pre  rrna  transfer pre  rnas  pre  trnas   and small nuclear pre  rnas
__label__0 the trnas have a critical role in translation  they serve as the adaptor molecules between the mrna template and the growing polypeptide chain
__label__0 enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed
__label__1 basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the dna template that subsequently recruits rna polymerase ii for transcription initiation
__label__0 the corresponding amino acid must be added later  once the trna is processed and exported to the cytoplasm
__label__1 through the process of trna  charging   each trna molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl trna synthetases
__label__0 at least one type of aminoacyl trna synthetase exists for each of the  amino acids  the exact number of aminoacyl trna synthetases varies by species
__label__0 many eukaryotic mrnas are translated from the first aug  but this is not always the case
__label__1 according to kozak s rules  the nucleotides around the aug indicate whether it is the correct start codon
__label__0 kozak s rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the aug of vertebrate genes     gcc rcc aug g
__label__0 usually  this is because the mrna is missing several u nucleotides
__label__0 the cell performs an additional rna processing step called rna editing to remedy this
__label__1 eukaryotic genes are composed of exons  which correspond to protein  coding sequences  ex  on signifies that they are expressed   and intervening sequences called introns  int  ron denotes their intervening role   which may be involved in gene regulation but are removed from the pre  mrna during processing
__label__0 intron sequences in mrna do not encode functional proteins
__label__0 all cells control or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their dna
__label__1 the process of turning on a gene to produce rna and protein is called gene expression
__label__0 whether in a simple unicellular organism or a complex multi  cellular organism  each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed
__label__0 in prokaryotic cells  there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons  repressors  activators  and inducers
__label__1 repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus  whereas activators are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus
__label__1 finally  inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate
__label__0 the five coding regions for the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon
__label__0 just before the coding region is the transcriptional start site
__label__1 this is the region of dna to which rna polymerase binds to initiate transcription
__label__0 just as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules  there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a positive regulator to turn genes on and activate them
__label__0 for example  when glucose is scarce  e
__label__0 one such sugar source is lactose
__label__1 the lac operon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment
__label__1 cap binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the lac operon
__label__1 when transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene  it is referred to as a cis  acting element  because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene
__label__1 the region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site
__label__0 transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed
__label__1 the   cap  which is placed on the   end of the mrna  is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule  gtp
__label__1 the poly  a tail  which is attached to the   end  is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides
__label__0 once the rna is transported to the cytoplasm  the length of time that the rna resides there can be controlled
__label__0 rather  these are regions that regulate mrna localization  stability  and protein translation
__label__1 the region just before the protein  coding region is called the   utr  whereas the region after the coding region is called the   utr   link
__label__0 the binding of rbps to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an rna molecule  depending on the specific rbp that binds
__label__0 these pre  mirnas are chopped into mature mirnas by a protein called dicer
__label__1 like transcription factors and rbps  mature mirnas recognize a specific sequence and bind to the rna  however  mirnas also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the rna  induced silencing complex  risc
__label__0 risc binds along with the mirna to degrade the target mrna
__label__1 the first protein to bind to the rna to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor  eif
__label__0 the eif protein is active when it binds to the high  energy molecule guanosine triphosphate  gtp
__label__0 gtp provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate  gdp
__label__0 at this point  when the initiator complex is assembled  the gtp is converted into gdp and energy is released
__label__0 the phosphate and the eif protein are released from the complex and the large s ribosomal subunit binds to translate the rna
__label__0 the binding of eif to the rna is controlled by phosphorylation
__label__0 an example of an oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc
__label__1 myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in burkett s lymphoma  a cancer of the lymph system
__label__1 myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in burkett s lymphoma  a cancer of the lymph system
__label__0 overexpression of myc transforms normal b cells into cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably
__label__0 cells are broken using a lysis buffer  a solution which is mostly a detergent   lysis means  to split
__label__1 these enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes
__label__1 macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins  and ribonucleases  rnases  that break down rna
__label__0 the dna is then precipitated using alcohol
__label__0 nucleic acid samples  such as fragmented genomic dna and rna extracts  can be probed for the presence of certain sequences
__label__1 short dna fragments called probes are designed and labeled with radioactive or fluorescent dyes to aid detection
__label__1 gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size
__label__0 plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation
__label__1 in the bacterial context  the fragment of dna from the human genome  or the genome of another organism that is being studied  is referred to as foreign dna  or a transgene  to differentiate it from the dna of the bacterium  which is called the host dna
__label__0 the mcs is a short dna sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases
__label__1 restriction endonucleases recognize specific dna sequences and cut them in a predictable manner  they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign dna
__label__0 many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of dna  such that the cut ends have a  or  base single  stranded overhang
__label__1 unicellular organisms  such as bacteria and yeast  naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by binary fission  this is known as cellular cloning
__label__0 the nuclear dna duplicates by the process of mitosis  which creates an exact replica of the genetic material
__label__0 the addition of foreign dna in the form of recombinant dna vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering
__label__1 the organism that receives the recombinant dna is called a genetically modified organism  gmo
__label__1 if the foreign dna that is introduced comes from a different species  the host organism is called transgenic
__label__1 the process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic testing
__label__0 depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease  causing gene  family members are advised to undergo genetic testing
__label__1 genomics is the study of entire genomes  including the complete set of genes  their nucleotide sequence and organization  and their interactions within a species and with other species
__label__1 genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome
__label__0 genetic maps provide the big picture  similar to a map of interstate highways  and use genetic markers  similar to landmarks
__label__1 a genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co  segregates  shows genetic linkage  with a specific trait
__label__0 early geneticists called this linkage analysis
__label__0 for example  in experiments performed on the garden pea  it was discovered that the color of the flower and shape of the plant s pollen were linked traits  and therefore the genes encoding these traits were in close proximity on the same chromosome
__label__1 the exchange of dna between homologous pairs of chromosomes is called genetic recombination  which occurs by the crossing over of dna between homologous strands of dna  such as nonsister chromatids
__label__1 linkage analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between any two genes
__label__0 it is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping  but not the exact distance  number of base pairs
__label__1 radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation  such as x  rays  to break the dna into fragments
__label__0 the amount of radiation can be adjusted to create smaller or larger fragments
__label__0 a genetic site used to generate a physical map with sequencing technology  a sequence  tagged site  or sts  is a unique sequence in the genome with a known exact chromosomal location
__label__0 an expressed sequence tag  est  and a single sequence length polymorphism  sslp  are common stss
__label__1 some of these are binocular cues  which means that they rely on the use of both eyes
__label__1 one example of a binocular depth cue is binocular disparity  the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives
__label__0 to experience this slightly different view  do this simple exercise  extend your arm fully and extend one of your fingers and focus on that finger
__label__1 the place theory of pitch perception suggests that different portions of the basilar membrane are sensitive to sounds of different frequencies
__label__0 more specifically  the base of the basilar membrane responds best to high frequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies
__label__0 if a sound comes from an off  center location  it creates two types of binaural cues  interaural level differences and interaural timing differences
__label__1 interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head
__label__1 interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear   link
__label__1 deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear
__label__1 some people are born deaf  which is known as congenital deafness
__label__0 many others begin to suffer from conductive hearing loss because of age  genetic predisposition  or environmental effects  including exposure to extreme noise  noise  induced hearing loss  as shown in  link    certain illnesses  such as measles or mumps   or damage due to toxins  such as those found in certain solvents and metals
__label__1 when the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain  it is called sensorineural hearing loss
__label__0 one disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is mnire s disease
__label__1 although not well understood  mnire s disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss  tinnitus  constant ringing or buzzing   vertigo  a sense of spinning   and an increase in pressure within the inner ear  semaan  megerian
__label__1 although not well understood  mnire s disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss  tinnitus  constant ringing or buzzing   vertigo  a sense of spinning   and an increase in pressure within the inner ear  semaan  megerian
__label__1 in the united states and other places around the world  deaf people have their own language  schools  and customs
__label__0 this is called deaf culture
__label__1 in the united states  deaf individuals often communicate using american sign language  asl   asl has no verbal component and is based entirely on visual signs and gestures
__label__0 umami is our fifth taste
__label__1 umami is actually a japanese word that roughly translates to yummy  and it is associated with a taste for monosodium glutamate  kinnamon  vandenbeuch
__label__0 there is also a growing body of experimental evidence suggesting that we possess a taste for the fatty content of a given food  mizushige  inoue   fushiki
__label__0 small hair  like extensions from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical receptors located on these extensions   link
__label__1 once an odor molecule has bound a given receptor  chemical changes within the cell result in signals being sent to the olfactory bulb  a bulb  like structure at the tip of the frontal lobe where the olfactory nerves begin
__label__0 from the olfactory bulb  information is sent to regions of the limbic system and to the primary olfactory cortex  which is located very near the gustatory cortex  lodovichi  belluscio    spors et al
__label__1 meissner s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations  and pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations
__label__0 merkel s disks respond to light pressure  while ruffini corpuscles detect stretch  abraira  ginty  there are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin  each attuned to specific touch  related stimuli
__label__1 as a result  pain signals that are sent to the brain get exaggerated
__label__0 this type of pain is known as neuropathic pain
__label__0 multiple treatment options for pain relief range from relaxation therapy to the use of analgesic medications to deep brain stimulation
__label__1 the law of continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous  smooth flowing lines rather than jagged  broken lines   link
__label__1 the principle of closure states that we organize our perceptions into complete objects rather than as a series of parts   link
__label__0 in this chapter  you have learned that perception is a complex process
__label__1 built from sensations  but influenced by our own experiences  biases  prejudices  and cultures  perceptions can be very different from person to person
__label__0 research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception
__label__0 does the name ivan pavlov ring a bell
__label__0 even if you are new to the study of psychology  chances are that you have heard of pavlov and his famous dogs
__label__0 in pavlov s experiments  the dogs salivated each time meat powder was presented to them
__label__1 the meat powder in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus  ucs   a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an organism
__label__1 the dogs  salivation was an unconditioned response  ucr   a natural  unlearned  reaction to a given stimulus
__label__1 the dogs  salivation was an unconditioned response  ucr   a natural  unlearned  reaction to a given stimulus
__label__0 when you finally got it fixed and started using it to open tiger s food again  tiger would remember the association between the can opener and her food  she would get excited and run to the kitchen when she heard the sound
__label__1 the behavior of pavlov s dogs and tiger illustrates a concept pavlov called spontaneous recovery  the return of a previously extinguished conditioned response following a rest period   link
__label__0 this is the curve of acquisition  extinction  and spontaneous recovery
__label__0 the rising curve shows the conditioned response quickly getting stronger through the repeated pairing of the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus  acquisition
__label__0 but if you do not feed her following the electric mixer sound  and you continue to feed her consistently after the electric can opener sound  she will quickly learn to discriminate between the two sounds  provided they are sufficiently dissimilar that she can tell them apart
__label__0 sometimes  classical conditioning can lead to habituation
__label__1 habituation occurs when we learn not to respond to a stimulus that is presented repeatedly without change
__label__0 as the stimulus occurs over and over  we learn not to focus our attention on it
__label__1 psychologist b f skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexively elicited  and it does nt account for new behaviors such as riding a bike
__label__0 he proposed a theory about how such behaviors come about
__label__0 the most effective way to teach a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement
__label__1 in positive reinforcement  a desirable stimulus is added to increase a behavior
__label__0 in contrast  punishment always decreases a behavior
__label__1 in positive punishment  you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease a behavior
__label__0 an example of positive punishment is scolding a student to get the student to stop texting in class
__label__0 how about joaquin  the soccer player
__label__0 if you gave joaquin a piece of candy every time he made a goal  you would be using a primary reinforcer
__label__1 primary reinforcers are reinforcers that have innate reinforcing qualities
__label__0 watch this video clip where veterinarian dr sophia yin shapes a dog s behavior using the steps outlined above  once a behavior is trained  researchers and trainers often turn to another type of reinforcement schedule  partial reinforcement
__label__1 in partial reinforcement  also referred to as intermittent reinforcement  the person or animal does not get reinforced every time they perform the desired behavior
__label__0 there are several different types of partial reinforcement schedules   link
__label__0 with a fixed ratio reinforcement schedule  there are a set number of responses that must occur before the behavior is rewarded
__label__0 carla sells glasses at an eyeglass store  and she earns a commission every time she sells a pair of glasses
__label__0 he also studied a comparison group that was rewarded with food at the end of the maze
__label__1 as the unreinforced rats explored the maze  they developed a cognitive map  a mental picture of the layout of the maze   link
__label__0 after  sessions in the maze without reinforcement  food was placed in a goal box at the end of the maze
__label__1 in observational learning  we learn by watching others and then imitating  or modeling  what they do or say
__label__1 the individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models
__label__0 research suggests that this imitative learning involves a specific type of neuron  called a mirror neuron  hickock    rizzolatti  fadiga  fogassi   gallese    rizzolatti  fogassi   gallese
__label__1 if you saw that the model was reinforced for her behavior  you will be more motivated to copy her
__label__0 this is known as vicarious reinforcement
__label__0 on the other hand  if you observed the model being punished  you would be less motivated to copy her
__label__0 this is only one facet of the complex processes involved in cognition
__label__1 simply put  cognition is thinking  and it encompasses the processes associated with perception  knowledge  problem solving  judgment  language  and memory
__label__0 scientists who study cognition are searching for ways to understand how we integrate  organize  and utilize our conscious cognitive experiences without being aware of all of the unconscious work that our brains are doing  for example  kahneman
__label__0 another technique used by your brain to organize information is the identification of prototypes for the concepts you have developed
__label__1 a prototype is the best example or representation of a concept
__label__0 for example  for the category of civil disobedience  your prototype could be rosa parks
__label__1 a schema is a mental construct consisting of a cluster or collection of related concepts  bartlett
__label__0 there are many different types of schemata  and they all have one thing in common  schemata are a method of organizing information that allows the brain to work more efficiently
__label__1 language is a communication system that involves using words and systematic rules to organize those words to transmit information from one individual to another
__label__0 while language is a form of communication  not all communication is language
__label__0 words are formed by combining the various phonemes that make up the language
__label__1 a phoneme  eg  the sounds  ah  vs  eh   is a basic sound unit of a given language  and different languages have different sets of phonemes
__label__1 phonemes are combined to form morphemes  which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning  eg   i  is both a phoneme and a morpheme
__label__1 semantics refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words
__label__1 syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences  chomsky    fernndez  cairns
__label__0 even the mistakes that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much they understand about those rules
__label__0 this is sometimes seen in the form of overgeneralization
__label__1 in this context  overgeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule
__label__0 another type of strategy is an algorithm
__label__1 an algorithm is a problem  solving formula that provides you with step  by  step instructions used to achieve a desired outcome  kahneman
__label__0 you can think of an algorithm as a recipe with highly detailed instructions that produce the same result every time they are performed
__label__0 the person is stuck  but she just needs to go to another doorway  instead of trying to get out through the locked doorway
__label__1 a mental set is where you persist in approaching a problem in a way that has worked in the past but is clearly not working now
__label__1 an anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem
__label__0 in this case  you re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point
__label__1 the confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs
__label__0 for example  if you think that your professor is not very nice  you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis
__label__1 finally  the availability heuristic is a heuristic in which you make a decision based on an example  information  or recent experience that is that readily available to you  even though it may not be the best example to inform your decision
__label__1 biases tend to  preserve that which is already established  to maintain our preexisting knowledge  beliefs  attitudes  and hypotheses   aronson    kahneman
__label__0 these biases are summarized in  link
__label__1 interestingly  drive theory also emphasizes the role that habits play in the type of behavioral response in which we engage
__label__1 a habit is a pattern of behavior in which we regularly engage
__label__0 once we have engaged in a behavior that successfully reduces a drive  we are more likely to engage in that behavior whenever faced with that drive in the future  graham  weiner
__label__0 analytical intelligence is closely aligned with academic problem solving and computations
__label__1 sternberg says that analytical intelligence is demonstrated by an ability to analyze  evaluate  judge  compare  and contrast
__label__0 gardner s inter and intrapersonal intelligences are often combined into a single type  emotional intelligence
__label__1 emotional intelligence encompasses the ability to understand the emotions of yourself and others  show empathy  understand social relationships and cues  and regulate your own emotions and respond in culturally appropriate ways  parker  saklofske   stough
__label__0 people with high emotional intelligence typically have well  developed social skills
__label__0 as blood glucose levels increase  the pancreas and liver send signals to shut off hunger and eating  drazen  woods    druce  small   bloom    greary
__label__1 the food s passage through the gastrointestinal tract also provides important satiety signals to the brain  woods     and fat cells release leptin  a satiety hormone
__label__0 this observation led some to propose a set  point theory of body weight regulation
__label__1 the set  point theory asserts that each individual has an ideal body weight  or set point  which is resistant to change
__label__0 this set  point is genetically predetermined and efforts to move our weight significantly from the set  point are resisted by compensatory changes in energy intake andor expenditure  speakman et al
__label__0 people who are so overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese
__label__1 morbid obesity is defined as having a bmi over
__label__0 note that although bmi has been used as a healthy weight indicator by the world health organization  who   the cdc  and other groups  its value as an assessment tool has been questioned
__label__1 people suffering from bulimia nervosa engage in binge eating behavior that is followed by an attempt to compensate for the large amount of food consumed
__label__0 purging the food by inducing vomiting or through the use of laxatives are two common compensatory behaviors
__label__1 anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through starvation andor excessive exercise
__label__1 individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image  referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia  meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though they are not
__label__0 like bulimia nervosa  anorexia nervosa is associated with a number of significant negative health outcomes  bone loss  heart failure  kidney failure  amenorrhea  cessation of the menstrual period   reduced function of the gonads  and in extreme cases  death
__label__0 masters and johnson s researchin   william masters and virginia johnson published a book detailing the results of their observations of nearly  people who agreed to participate in their study of physiological responses during sexual behavior
__label__0 unlike kinsey  who used personal interviews and surveys to collect data  masters and johnson observed people having intercourse in a variety of positions  and they observed people masturbating  manually or with the aid of a device
__label__1 the excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle  and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal
__label__0 during plateau  women experience further swelling of the vagina and increased blood flow to the labia minora  and men experience full erection and often exhibit pre  ejaculatory fluid
__label__0 both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time
__label__0 while many women can quickly repeat the sexual response cycle  men must pass through a longer refractory period as part of resolution
__label__1 the refractory period is a period of time that follows an orgasm during which an individual is incapable of experiencing another orgasm
__label__0 in men  the duration of the refractory period can vary dramatically from individual to individual with some refractory periods as short as several minutes and others as long as a day
__label__0 this involves dressing in opposite  sex clothing and assuming an opposite  sex identity
__label__0 these individuals may also undertake transgender hormone therapy in an attempt to make their bodies look more like the opposite sex  and in some cases  they elect to have surgeries to alter the appearance of their external genitalia to resemble that of their gender identity   link
__label__0 while these may sound like drastic changes  gender dysphoric individuals take these steps because their bodies seem to them to be a mistake of nature  and they seek to correct this mistake
__label__1 standardization means that the manner of administration  scoring  and interpretation of results is consistent
__label__1 norming involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups  such as age groups
__label__0 the resulting data provide norms  or referential scores  by which to interpret future scores
__label__0 the average iq score on an iq test is
__label__1 standard deviations describe how data are dispersed in a population and give context to large data sets
__label__1 the bell curve uses the standard deviation to show how all scores are dispersed from the average score   link
__label__1 range of reaction is the theory that each person responds to the environment in a unique way based on his or her genetic makeup
__label__0 according to this idea  your genetic potential is a fixed quantity  but whether you reach your full intellectual potential is dependent upon the environmental stimulation you experience  especially in childhood
__label__0 as we move through our daily lives  we experience a variety of emotions
__label__1 an emotion is a subjective state of being that we often describe as our feelings
__label__0 the words emotion and mood are sometimes used interchangeably  but psychologists use these words to refer to two different things
__label__0 the assumption is that most of us would show signs of physiological arousal if we were being dishonest with someone
__label__1 a polygraph  or lie detector test  measures the physiological arousal of an individual responding to a series of questions
__label__0 someone trained in reading these tests would look for answers to questions that are associated with increased levels of arousal as potential signs that the respondent may have been dishonest on those answers
__label__0 amygdalathe amygdala has received a great deal of attention from researchers interested in understanding the biological basis for emotions  especially fear and anxiety  blackford  pine    goosens  maren    maren  phan   liberzon
__label__1 the amygdala is composed of various subnuclei  including the basolateral complex and the central nucleus   link
__label__0 or does being happy make you smile
__label__1 the facial feedback hypothesis asserts that facial expressions are capable of influencing our emotions  meaning that smiling can make you feel happier  buck    soussignan    strack  martin   stepper
__label__1 recent research explored how botox  which paralyzes facial muscles and limits facial expression  might affect emotion
__label__1 hippocrates theorized that personality traits and human behaviors are based on four separate temperaments associated with four fluids   humors   of the body  choleric temperament  yellow bile from the liver   melancholic temperament  black bile from the kidneys   sanguine temperament  red blood from the heart   and phlegmatic temperament  white phlegm from the lungs   clark  watson    eysenck  eysenck    lecci  magnavita    noga
__label__1 centuries later  the influential greek physician and philosopher galen built on hippocrates s theory  suggesting that both diseases and personality differences could be explained by imbalances in the humors and that each person exhibits one of the four temperaments
__label__0 for example  the choleric person is passionate  ambitious  and bold  the melancholic person is reserved  anxious  and unhappy  the sanguine person is joyful  eager  and optimistic  and the phlegmatic person is calm  reliable  and thoughtful  clark  watson    stelmack  stalikas
__label__0 when certain events  feelings  or yearnings cause an individual anxiety  the individual wishes to reduce that anxiety
__label__1 to do that  the individual s unconscious mind uses ego defense mechanisms  unconscious protective behaviors that aim to reduce anxiety
__label__1 the ego  usually conscious  resorts to unconscious strivings to protect the ego from being overwhelmed by anxiety
__label__0 in each psychosexual stage of development  the child s pleasure  seeking urges  coming from the i d  are focused on a different area of the body  called an erogenous zone
__label__0 the stages are oral  anal  phallic  latency  and genital   link
__label__0 freud s psychosexual development theory is quite controversial
__label__1 freud s third stage of psychosexual development is the phallic stage     years   corresponding to the age when children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between boys and girls
__label__0 the erogenous zone in this stage is the genitals
__label__0 alfred adler  a colleague of freud s and the first president of the vienna psychoanalytical society  freud s inner circle of colleagues   was the first major theorist to break away from freud   link
__label__1 he subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology  which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority
__label__0 as an art school dropout with an uncertain future  young erik erikson met freud s daughter  anna freud  while he was tutoring the children of an american couple undergoing psychoanalysis in vienna
__label__0 it was anna freud who encouraged erikson to study psychoanalysis
__label__1 the collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious  holding mental patterns  or memory traces  which are common to all of us  jung
__label__1 these ancestral memories  which jung called archetypes  are represented by universal themes in various cultures  as expressed through literature  art  and dreams  jung
__label__0 jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over  such as facing death  becoming independent  and striving for mastery
__label__1 we get information into our brains through a process called encoding  which is the input of information into the memory system
__label__0 once we receive sensory information from the environment  our brains label or code it
__label__0 our brains take the encoded information and place it in storage
__label__1 storage is the creation of a permanent record of information
__label__0 in order for a memory to go into storage  ie  long  term memory   it has to pass through three distinct stages  sensory memory  short  term memory  and finally long  term memory
__label__0 note  sometimes  but not always  the terms explicit memory and declarative memory are used interchangeably
__label__1 implicit memories are memories that are not part of our consciousness
__label__0 they are memories formed from behaviors
__label__1 semantic means having to do with language and knowledge about language
__label__0 an example would be the question  what does argumentative mean   stored in our semantic memory is knowledge about words  concepts  and language  based knowledge and facts
__label__0 for example  answers to the following questions are stored in your semantic memory
__label__0 very few people can recall events in this way  right now  only  known individuals have this ability  and only a few have been studied  parker  cahill  mcgaugh
__label__0 and although hyperthymesia normally appears in adolescence  two children in the united states appear to have memories from well before their tenth birthdays
__label__0 for example  you would use recall for an essay test
__label__1 recognition happens when you identify information that you have previously learned after encountering it again
__label__0 it involves a process of comparison
__label__0 although the hippocampus seems to be more of a processing area for explicit memories  you could still lose it and be able to create implicit memories  procedural memory  motor learning  and classical conditioning   thanks to your cerebellum   link
__label__0 for example  one classical conditioning experiment is to accustom subjects to blink when they are given a puff of air
__label__1 julian rotter    proposed the concept of locus of control  another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development
__label__1 julian rotter    proposed the concept of locus of control  another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality the
__label__1 distinct from self  efficacy  which involves our belief in our own abilities  locus of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives
__label__0 amnesia
__label__1 amnesia is the loss of long  term memory that occurs as the result of disease  physical trauma  or psychological trauma
__label__0 psychologist tulving    and his colleagues at the university of toronto studied k c for years
__label__1 the formulation of new memories is sometimes called construction  and the process of bringing up old memories is called reconstruction
__label__0 yet as we retrieve our memories  we also tend to alter and modify them
__label__0 contrast the cotton case with what happened in the elizabeth smart case
__label__0 when elizabeth was  years old and fast asleep in her bed at home  she was abducted at knifepoint
__label__0 i ve a grand memory for forgetting   quipped robert louis stevenson
__label__1 forgetting refers to loss of information from long  term memory
__label__0 we all forget things  like a loved one s birthday  someone s name  or where we put our car keys
__label__0 you probably answered yes to at least one  if not all  of these examples  but do nt worry  you are not alone
__label__0 we are all prone to committing the memory error known as absentmindedness
__label__1 these lapses in memory are caused by breaks in attention or our focus being somewhere else  cynthia  a psychologist  recalls a time when she recently committed the memory error of absentmindedness
__label__0 how about a memory of a traumatic event  something you really do not want to think about
__label__1 when you keep remembering something  to the point where you ca nt  get it out of your head  and it interferes with your ability to concentrate on other things  it is called persistence
__label__0 it s schacter s seventh and last memory error
__label__1 as the  third force  in psychology  humanism is touted as a reaction both to the pessimistic determinism of psychoanalysis  with its emphasis on psychological disturbance  and to the behaviorists  view of humans passively reacting to the environment  which has been criticized as making people out to be personality  less robots
__label__0 it does not suggest that psychoanalytic  behaviorist  and other points of view are incorrect but argues that these perspectives do not recognize the depth and meaning of human experience  and fail to recognize the innate capacity for self  directed change and transforming personal experiences
__label__0 rogers further divided the self into two categories  the ideal self and the real self
__label__1 the ideal self is the person that you would like to be  the real self is the person you actually are
__label__0 rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves
__label__0 what are some everyday ways we can improve our memory  including recall
__label__1 to help make sure information goes from short  term memory to long  term memory  you can use memory  enhancing strategies
__label__1 in order to describe the motion of an object  you must first be able to describe its position  where it is at any particular time
__label__0 more precisely  you need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame
__label__0 note that the distance between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between them
__label__1 distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two positions
__label__0 distance has no direction and  thus  no sign
__label__1 the motion of falling objects  as covered in problem  solving basics for one  dimensional kinematics  is a simple one  dimensional type of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement
__label__0 in this section  we consider two  dimensional projectile motion  such as that of a football or other object for which air resistance is negligible
__label__0 the most important fact to remember here is that motions along perpendicular axes are independent and thus can be analyzed separately
__label__0 this fact was discussed in kinematics in two dimensions  an introduction  where vertical and horizontal motions were seen to be independent
__label__1 when adding velocities  we have been careful to specify that the velocity is relative to some reference frame
__label__0 these velocities are called relative velocities
__label__0 for example  the velocity of an airplane relative to an air mass is different from its velocity relative to the ground
__label__0 to understand this  we need a working definition of force
__label__0 our intuitive definition of force  that is  a push or a pull  is a good place to start
__label__0 we know that a push or pull has both magnitude and direction  therefore  it is a vector quantity  and can vary considerably in each regard
__label__1 force is a push or pull that can be defined in terms of various standards  and it is a vector having both magnitude and direction
__label__0 newton s second law of motion is closely related to newton s first law of motion
__label__1 it mathematically states the cause and effect relationship between force and changes in motion
__label__0 these will be discussed in more detail in later sections
__label__1 for now  we will define friction as a force that opposes the motion past each other of objects that are touching
__label__0 link   b  shows how vectors representing the external forces add together to produce a net force
__label__1 this means the rocket exerts a large backward force on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber  and the gas therefore exerts a large reaction force forward on the rocket
__label__0 this reaction force is called thrust
__label__0 it is a common misconception that rockets propel themselves by pushing on the ground or on the air behind them
__label__1 a diagram showing the system of interest and all of the external forces is called a free  body diagram
__label__0 only forces are shown on free  body diagrams  not acceleration or velocity
__label__0 eventually a large enough stress to the material will cause it to break or fracture
__label__1 tensile strength is the breaking stress that will cause permanent deformation or fracture of a material  hooke s law
__label__0 calculate the centripetal acceleration of a point  cm from the axis of an ultracentrifuge spinning at
__label__1 for ideal banking  the net external force equals the horizontal centripetal force in the absence of friction
__label__0 the components of the normal force n in the horizontal and vertical directions must equal the centripetal force and the weight of the car  respectively
__label__1 the si unit for time  the second  abbreviated s   has a long history
__label__0 for many years it was defined as    of a mean solar day
__label__0 si units are part of the metric system
__label__0 the metric system is convenient for scientific and engineering calculations because the units are categorized by factors of
__label__0 scientists are continually trying to expand this body of knowledge and to perfect the expression of the laws that describe it
__label__1 physics is concerned with describing the interactions of energy  matter  space  and time  and it is especially interested in what fundamental mechanisms underlie every phenomenon
__label__0 the concern for describing the basic phenomena in nature essentially defines the realm of physics  physics aims to describe the function of everything around us  from the movement of tiny charged particles to the motion of people  cars  and spaceships
__label__1 the kinetic theory of gases  on the other hand  is a model in which a gas is viewed as being composed of atoms and molecules
__label__0 atoms and molecules are too small to be observed directly with our senses  thus  we picture them mentally to understand what our instruments tell us about the behavior of gases
__label__1 a law uses concise language to describe a generalized pattern in nature that is supported by scientific evidence and repeated experiments
__label__0 often  a law can be expressed in the form of a single mathematical equation
__label__0 modern physics itself consists of the two revolutionary theories  relativity and quantum mechanics
__label__0 these theories deal with the very fast and the very small  respectively
__label__0 average speed  however  is very different from average velocity
__label__1 average speed is the distance traveled divided by elapsed time
__label__1 average acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes
__label__0 the force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of earth
__label__1 the acceleration of free  falling objects is therefore called the acceleration due to gravity
__label__0 the acceleration due to gravity is constant  which means we can apply the kinematics equations to any falling object where air resistance and friction are negligible
__label__0 science is based on observation and experiment  that is  on measurements
__label__1 accuracy is how close a measurement is to the correct value for that measurement
__label__0 for example  let us say that you are measuring the length of standard computer paper
__label__0 how big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division
__label__0 if the measurements going into the calculation have small uncertainties  a few percent or less   then the method of adding percents can be used for multiplication or division
__label__0 this method says that the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation
__label__0 an understanding of acceleration  for example  is crucial to the study of force
__label__1 our formal study of physics begins with kinematics which is defined as the study of motion without considering its causes
__label__0 the word  kinematics  comes from a greek term meaning motion and is related to other english words such as  cinema   movies  and  kinesiology   the study of human motion
__label__1 a vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction
__label__0 displacement  velocity  acceleration  and force  for example  are all vectors
__label__0 note that in our example  we have only two vectors  so we have finished placing arrows tip to tail
__label__0 step
__label__0 draw an arrow from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector
__label__0 this is the resultant  or the sum  of the other vectors
__label__0 the head of the vector d meets the head of the vertical vector
__label__0 this characteristic is true in every case and is an important characteristic of vectors
__label__0 vector addition is commutative
__label__0 vectors can be added in any order
__label__0 a  b  b  a
__label__0 a  b  b  a
__label__0 size
__label__0 this is true for the addition of ordinary numbers as well  you get the same result whether you add       size
__label__1 the head  to  tail method of adding vectors involves drawing the first vector on a graph and then placing the tail of each subsequent vector at the head of the previous vector
__label__0 the resultant vector is then drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the final vector
__label__0 experience suggests that an object at rest will remain at rest if left alone  and that an object in motion tends to slow down and stop unless some effort is made to keep it moving
__label__0 what newton s first law of motion states  however  is the following
__label__0 the quantities that might differ between them are volume and density
__label__0 section summary
__label__1 newton s first law of motion states that a body at rest remains at rest  or  if in motion  remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force
__label__0 this is also known as the law of inertia
__label__0 as we will see  the basic forces are all thought to act through the exchange of microscopic carrier particles  and the characteristics of the basic forces are determined by the types of particles exchanged
__label__0 action at a distance  such as the gravitational force of earth on the moon  is explained by the existence of a force field rather than by  physical contact
__label__1 friction is a force that is around us all the time that opposes relative motion between systems in contact but also allows us to move  which you have discovered if you have ever tried to walk on ice
__label__0 while a common force  the behavior of friction is actually very complicated and is still not completely understood
__label__0 we will therefore study not only motion along curves  but also the forces that cause it  including gravitational forces
__label__0 in some ways  this chapter is a continuation of dynamics  newton s laws of motion as we study more applications of newton s laws of motion
__label__0 this chapter deals with the simplest form of curved motion  uniform circular motion  motion in a circular path at constant speed
__label__0 studying this topic illustrates most concepts associated with rotational motion and leads to the study of many new topics we group under the name rotation
__label__0 you take the merry  go  round to be your frame of reference because you rotate together
__label__0 in that non  inertial frame  you feel a fictitious force  named centrifugal force  not to be confused with centripetal force   trying to throw you off
__label__0 you must hang on tightly to counteract the centrifugal force
__label__0 the bodies we are dealing with tend to be large
__label__0 to simplify the situation we assume that the body acts as if its entire mass is concentrated at one specific point called the center of mass  cm   which will be further explored in linear momentum and collisions
__label__0 for two bodies having masses mm size   m    and m m size   m    with a distance r r size   r    between their centers of mass  the equation for newton s universal law of gravitation is f  g m m r   f  g m m r   size   f  g   ital
__label__0 energy is characterized by its many forms and the fact that it is conserved
__label__1 we can loosely define energy as the ability to do work  admitting that in some circumstances not all energy is available to do work
__label__0 because of the association of energy with work  we begin the chapter with a discussion of work
__label__0 this expression is called the work  energy theorem  and it actually applies in general  even for forces that vary in direction and magnitude   although we have derived it for the special case of a constant force parallel to the displacement
__label__0 the theorem implies that the net work on a system equals the change in the quantity  m v   m v  size       over     ital
__label__0 where i and f denote initial and final values
__label__0 this equation is a form of the work  energy theorem for conservative forces  it is known as the conservation of mechanical energy principle
__label__0 remember that this applies to the extent that all the forces are conservative  so that friction is negligible
__label__0 law of conservation of energy
__label__0 energy  as we have noted  is conserved  making it one of the most important physical quantities in nature
__label__1 the law of conservation of energy can be stated as follows  total energy is constant in any process
__label__0 it may change in form or be transferred from one system to another  but the total remains the same
__label__0 we have explored some forms of energy and some ways it can be transferred from one system to another
__label__1 most energy sources on earth are in fact stored energy from the energy we receive from the sun
__label__0 we sometimes refer to this as radiant energy  or electromagnetic radiation  which includes visible light  infrared  and ultraviolet radiation
__label__1 nuclear energy comes from processes that convert measurable amounts of mass into energy
__label__1 the rate at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do different activities is called the metabolic rate
__label__1 the total energy conversion rate of a person at rest is called the basal metabolic rate  bmr  and is divided among various systems in the body  as shown in  link
__label__0 the fuel mix has changed over the years but now is dominated by oil  although natural gas and solar contributions are increasing
__label__1 renewable forms of energy are those sources that can not be used up  such as water  wind  solar  and biomass
__label__0 about   of our energy comes from nonrenewable fossil fuels  oil  natural gas  coal
__label__0 the importance of momentum  unlike the importance of energy  was recognized early in the development of classical physics
__label__1 momentum was deemed so important that it was called the  quantity of motion   newton actually stated his second law of motion in terms of momentum  the net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes
__label__0 using symbols  this law is
__label__0 link  below illustrates how a particle scattering backward from another implies that its target is massive and dense
__label__1 experiments seeking evidence that quarks make up protons  one type of particle that makes up nuclei  scattered high  energy electrons off of protons  nuclei of hydrogen atoms
__label__0 electrons occasionally scattered straight backward in a manner that implied a very small and very dense particle makes up the proton  this observation is considered nearly direct evidence of quarks
__label__1 an elastic collision is one that conserves internal kinetic energy
__label__0 but the internal kinetic energy is zero after the collision
__label__1 a collision in which the objects stick together is sometimes called a perfectly inelastic collision because it reduces internal kinetic energy more than does any other type of inelastic collision
__label__0 in fact  such a collision reduces internal kinetic energy to the minimum it can have while still conserving momentum
__label__0 perfectly inelastic collision
__label__1 a system is said to be in stable equilibrium if  when displaced from equilibrium  it experiences a net force or torque in a direction opposite to the direction of the displacement
__label__0 for example  a marble at the bottom of a bowl will experience a restoring force when displaced from its equilibrium position
__label__0 the first step is to determine whether or not the system is in static equilibrium
__label__0 this condition is always the case when the acceleration of the system is zero and accelerated rotation does not occur
__label__0 before we can consider the rotation of anything other than a point mass like the one in  link   we must extend the idea of rotational inertia to all types of objects
__label__0 to expand our concept of rotational inertia  we define the moment of inertia
__label__0 these expressions are the law of conservation of angular momentum
__label__0 conservation laws are as scarce as they are important
__label__0 density  as you will see  is an important characteristic of substances
__label__0 it is crucial  for example  in determining whether an object sinks or floats in a fluid
__label__0 remarkably  the pressure is transmitted undiminished
__label__1 this phenomenon is called pascal s principle  because it was first clearly stated by the french philosopher and scientist blaise pascal       a change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and to the walls of its container
__label__0 this means that the upward force on the bottom of an object in a fluid is greater than the downward force on the top of the object
__label__0 there is a net upward  or buoyant force on any object in any fluid
__label__0 see  link
__label__1 attractive forces between molecules of the same type are called cohesive forces
__label__0 liquids can  for example  be held in open containers because cohesive forces hold the molecules together
__label__1 one important phenomenon related to the relative strength of cohesive and adhesive forces is capillary action  the tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube  or capillary tube
__label__0 this action causes blood to be drawn into a small  diameter tube when the tube touches a drop
__label__1 the shape of the eye is maintained by fluid pressure  called intraocular pressure  which is normally in the range of  to  mm hg
__label__1 when the circulation of fluid in the eye is blocked  it can lead to a buildup in pressure  a condition called glaucoma
__label__0 how does the body regulate blood flow
__label__1 the physics of fluids in motion  fluid dynamics  allows us to answer these and many other questions
__label__0 link  shows both types of flow
__label__1 laminar flow is characterized by the smooth flow of the fluid in layers that do not mix
__label__1 turbulent flow  or turbulence  is characterized by eddies and swirls that mix layers of fluid together
__label__0 q  p  p   r   l

__label__0 size   q      p rsub  size       p rsub  size         r rsup  size       over    l
__label__0 this equation describes laminar flow through a tube
__label__0 it is sometimes called poiseuille s law for laminar flow  or simply poiseuille s law
__label__0 this motion is called a random walk and is illustrated in  link
__label__1 diffusion is the movement of substances due to random thermal molecular motion
__label__0 fluids  like fish fumes or odors entering ice cubes  can even diffuse through solids
__label__0 when you soak a swollen ankle in epsom salt  the water moves out of your body into the lower  concentration region in the salt
__label__1 similarly  dialysis is the transport of any other molecule through a semipermeable membrane due to its concentration difference
__label__0 both osmosis and dialysis are used by the kidneys to cleanse the blood
__label__0 heat transfer is maintained by temperature differences
__label__0 manifestations of heat transfer  the movement of heat energy from one place or material to another  are apparent throughout the universe
__label__0 heat from beneath earth s surface is brought to the surface in flows of incandescent lava
__label__0 
__label__0 the kelvin scale is the temperature scale that is commonly used in science
__label__1 it is an absolute temperature scale defined to have  k at the lowest possible temperature  called absolute zero
__label__1 it is an absolute temperature scale defined to have  k at the lowest possible temperature  called absolute zero

__label__1 the expansion of alcohol in a thermometer is one of many commonly encountered examples of thermal expansion  the change in size or volume of a given mass with temperature
__label__0 hot air rises because its volume increases  which causes the hot air s density to be smaller than the density of surrounding air  causing a buoyant  upward  force on the hot air
__label__0 moles and avogadro s number
__label__0 it is sometimes convenient to work with a unit other than molecules when measuring the amount of substance
__label__1 a mole  abbreviated mol  is defined to be the amount of a substance that contains as many atoms or molecules as there are atoms in exactly  grams   kg  of carbon
__label__0 the actual number of atoms or molecules in one mole is called avogadro s number  na   na  size     n rsub  size   a         in recognition of italian scientist amedeo avogadro

__label__1 critical pressure is the minimum pressure needed for liquid to exist at the critical temperature
__label__0 link  lists representative critical temperatures and pressures
__label__0 pv pv size   ital
__label__1 vapor pressure is defined as the pressure at which a gas coexists with its solid or liquid phase
__label__0 vapor pressure is created by faster molecules that break away from the liquid or solid and enter the gas phase
__label__0 when we say humidity  we really mean relative humidity
__label__1 relative humidity tells us how much water vapor is in the air compared with the maximum possible
__label__1 we define percent relative humidity as the ratio of vapor density to saturation vapor density  or
__label__1 sublimation is the transition from solid to vapor phase
__label__0 you may have noticed that snow can disappear into thin air without a trace of liquid water  or the disappearance of ice cubes in a freezer
__label__1 heat transfer by radiation occurs when microwaves  infrared radiation  visible light  or another form of electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed
__label__0 an obvious example is the warming of the earth by the sun
__label__1 there is a negative feedback  one in which a change produces an effect that opposes that change  between clouds and heat transfer  greater temperatures evaporate more water to form more clouds  which reflect more radiation back into space  reducing the temperature
__label__0 the often mentioned greenhouse effect is directly related to the variation of the earth s emissivity with radiation type  see the figure given below
__label__1 the greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon responsible for providing temperatures suitable for life on earth
__label__1 one of the most important things we can do with heat transfer is to use it to do work for us
__label__0 such a device is called a heat engine
__label__0 car engines and steam turbines that generate electricity are examples of heat engines
__label__0 for comparison  both are shown starting from the same point a
__label__1 the upper curve ending at point b is an isothermal process  that is  one in which temperature is kept constant
__label__0 if the gas behaves like an ideal gas  as is often the case  and if no phase change occurs  then pv  n rt pv  n rt size   ital
__label__0 the already familiar direction of heat transfer from hot to cold is the basis of our first version of the second law of thermodynamics
__label__0 link  illustrates the operation of the common four  stroke gasoline engine
__label__0 the four steps shown complete this heat engine s cycle  bringing the gasoline  air mixture back to its original condition
__label__0 the otto cycle shown in  link   a  is used in four  stroke internal combustion engines  although in fact the true otto cycle paths do not correspond exactly to the strokes of the engine
__label__0 stated in terms of reversible processes  the second law of thermodynamics has a third form
__label__0 these are what we call macrostates
__label__1 a macrostate is an overall property of a system
__label__0 it does not specify the details of the system  such as the order in which heads and tails occur or which coins are heads or tails
__label__0 what do an ocean buoy  a child in a swing  the cone inside a speaker  a guitar  atoms in a crystal  the motion of chest cavities  and the beating of hearts all have in common
__label__1 they all oscillate   that is  they move back and forth between two points
__label__0 many systems oscillate  and they have certain characteristics in common
__label__0 each successive vibration of the string takes the same time as the previous one
__label__1 we define periodic motion to be a motion that repeats itself at regular time intervals  such as exhibited by the guitar string or by an object on a spring moving up and down
__label__0 the time to complete one oscillation remains constant and is called the period t t size   t
__label__1 the driving force puts energy into the system at a certain frequency  not necessarily the same as the natural frequency of the system
__label__1 the natural frequency is the frequency at which a system would oscillate if there were no driving and no damping force
__label__0 most of us have played with toys involving an object supported on an elastic band  something like the paddle ball suspended from a finger in  link
__label__0 imagine the finger in the figure is your finger
__label__0 the most intuitive and easiest wave to imagine is the familiar water wave
__label__1 more precisely  a wave is a disturbance that propagates  or moves from the place it was created
__label__0 for water waves  the disturbance is in the surface of the water  perhaps created by a rock thrown into a pond or by a swimmer splashing the surface repeatedly
__label__1 such a wave is called a transverse wave or shear wave  in such a wave  the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of propagation
__label__1 in contrast  in a longitudinal wave or compressional wave  the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation
__label__0 link  shows an example of a longitudinal wave
__label__0 link  shows two identical waves that arrive exactly out of phase  that is  precisely aligned crest to trough  producing pure destructive interference
__label__0 because the disturbances are in the opposite direction for this superposition  the resulting amplitude is zero for pure destructive interference  the waves completely cancel
__label__0 the fixed ends of strings must be nodes  too  because the string can not move there
__label__1 the word antinode is used to denote the location of maximum amplitude in standing waves
__label__0 standing waves on strings have a frequency that is related to the propagation speed vwvw size   v rsub  size   w      of the disturbance on the string
__label__0 because hearing is one of our most important senses  it is interesting to see how the physical properties of sound correspond to our perceptions of it
__label__1 hearing is the perception of sound  just as vision is the perception of visible light
__label__0 but sound has important applications beyond hearing
__label__0 note that because only the ratio i  i i  i is given  and not the actual intensities   this result is true for any intensities that differ by a factor of two
__label__0 for example  a  db sound is twice as intense as a  db sound  a  db sound is half as intense as a  db sound  and so on
__label__0 it should be noted at this point that there is another decibel scale in use  called the sound pressure level  based on the ratio of the pressure amplitude to a reference pressure
__label__0 this scale is used particularly in applications where sound travels in water
__label__1 interference microscopes enhance contrast between objects and background by superimposing a reference beam of light upon the light emerging from the sample
__label__0 since light from the background and objects differ in phase  there will be different amounts of constructive and destructive interference  producing the desired contrast in final intensity
__label__0 apart from the uv microscope  the variations of microscopy discussed so far in this section are available as attachments to fairly standard microscopes or as slight variations
__label__1 the next level of sophistication is provided by commercial confocal microscopes  which use the extended focal region shown in  link   b  to obtain three  dimensional images rather than two  dimensional images
__label__0 here  only a single plane or region of focus is identified  out  of  focus regions above and below this plane are subtracted out by a computer so the image quality is much better
__label__0 we use specific terms for the resonances in any system
__label__1 the lowest resonant frequency is called the fundamental  while all higher resonant frequencies are called overtones
__label__1 all resonant frequencies are integral multiples of the fundamental  and they are collectively called harmonics
__label__0 normal human hearing encompasses frequencies from  to  hz  an impressive range
__label__1 sounds below  hz are called infrasound  whereas those above  hz are ultrasound
__label__0 neither is perceived by the ear  although infrasound can sometimes be felt as vibrations
__label__0 very few measuring devices are capable of observations over a range of a trillion
__label__1 the perception of intensity is called loudness
__label__0 at a given frequency  it is possible to discern differences of about  db  and a change of  db is easily noticed
__label__1 another major use of ultrasound in medical diagnostics is to detect motion and determine velocity through the doppler shift of an echo  known as doppler  shifted ultrasound
__label__0 this technique is used to monitor fetal heartbeat  measure blood velocity  and detect occlusions in blood vessels  for example
__label__0 how do we know there are two types of electric charge
__label__0 when various materials are rubbed together in controlled ways  certain combinations of materials always produce one type of charge on one material and the opposite type on the other
__label__1 in fact  in all situations the total amount of charge is always constant
__label__0 this universally obeyed law of nature is called the law of conservation of charge
__label__0 in other words  the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons
__label__1 other substances  such as glass  do not allow charges to move through them
__label__0 these are called insulators
__label__0 even when their climate and land are well  suited to products like cotton  rice  sugar  or milk  farmers in low  income countries find it difficult to compete
__label__0 farm subsidies in the high  income countries cause farmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce
__label__0 this increase in supply drives down world prices of farm products below the costs of production
__label__0 one concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high  skilled  high  wage workers in the united states  it may also impose costs on low  skilled  low  wage workers
__label__0 after all  high  skilled us workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers  machinery  and pharmaceuticals in which the united states has a comparative advantage
__label__0 however  bhutanese politicians  business leaders  and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established  before it needed to face international competition  then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills  management  technology  and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit  earning domestic industry
__label__1 thus  the infant industry argument for protectionism is to block imports for a limited time  to give the infant industry time to mature  before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy
__label__0 revisit macroeconomic policy around the world for more information on the infant industry argument
__label__1 anti  dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production
__label__0 since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the world trade organization  wto   nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the wto
__label__0 anti  dumping complaints have risen in recent years  from about  cases per year in the late s to about  new cases each year by the late s
__label__0 in general  high  income countries such as the united states  canada  japan  and the nations of the european union have relatively strict environmental standards
__label__0 in contrast  middle and low  income countries like brazil  nigeria  india  and china have lower environmental standards
__label__0 the general view of the governments of such countries is that environmental protection is a luxury  as soon as their people have enough to eat  decent healthcare  and longer life expectancies  then they will spend more money on sewage treatment plants  scrubbers to reduce air pollution from factory smokestacks  national parks to protect wildlife  and so on
__label__0 the world trade organization  wto  was officially born in   but its history is much longer
__label__0 in the years after the great depression and world war ii  there was a worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the nations of the world together
__label__0 the best known of these regional trading agreements is the european union
__label__0 in the years after world war ii  leaders of several european nations reasoned that if they could tie their economies together more closely  they might be more likely to avoid another devastating war
__label__0 in other words  the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not disruptive or does not pose tradeoffs  indeed  the story of technotron begins with a particular disruptive market change  a new technology  that causes real tradeoffs
__label__0 in thinking about the disruptions of foreign trade  or any of the other possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter  the best public policy solutions typically do not involve protectionism  but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address the particular issues  while still allowing the benefits of international trade to occur
__label__0 the m term in the equation for the line is the slope
__label__0 remember that slope is defined as rise over run  more specifically  the slope of a line from one point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal axis
__label__0 in this example  each time the x term increases by one  the run   the y term rises by three
__label__1 one common line graph is called a time series  in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis displays another variable
__label__0 thus  a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time
__label__0 economists use a vocabulary of maximizing utility to describe people s preferences
__label__0 in consumer choices  the level of utility that a person receives is described in numerical terms
__label__0 this appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences  called indifference curves  which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility
__label__0 thus  the marginal utility that lilly would gain from  say  increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from  to   so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points a and b
__label__1 indeed  the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the marginal rate of substitution  which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same
__label__0 indifference curves like um are steeper on the left and flatter on the right
__label__0 a rise in income causes the budget constraint to shift to the right
__label__0 in graphical terms  the new budget constraint will now be tangent to a higher indifference curve  representing a higher level of utility
__label__0 a reduction in income will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left  which will cause it to be tangent to a lower indifference curve  representing a reduced level of utility
__label__0 the price of haircuts rises to
__label__0 ogden starts at choice a on the higher opportunity set and the higher indifference curve
__label__0 after the price of pizza increases  he chooses b on the lower opportunity set and the lower indifference curve
__label__0 the price of a stock depends on the expected future profits earned by the firm
__label__1 the concept of a present discounted value  pdv   which is defined as the amount you should be willing to pay in the present for a stream of expected future payments  can be used to calculate appropriate prices for stocks and bonds
__label__0 to place a present discounted value on a future payment  think about what amount of money you would need to have in the present to equal a certain amount in the future
__label__0 the keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion
__label__0 the first is a vertical line showing the level of potential gdp
__label__1 potential gdp means the same thing here that it means in the ad  as diagrams  it refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full employment of its labor and physical capital  the second conceptual line on the keynesian cross diagram is the degree line  which starts at the origin and reaches up and to the right
__label__0 link  shows an investment function where the level of investment is  for the sake of concreteness  set at the specific level of
__label__0 just as a consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels and real gdp  or national income   the investment function shows the relationship between investment levels and real gdp
__label__0 imports are  of real gdp in this example  and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column
__label__0 the final column  aggregate expenditures  sums up c  i  g  x  m
__label__0 this aggregate expenditure line is illustrated in  link
__label__0 in this situation  the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for gdp to reach its full employment level  and unemployment will occur
__label__0 the distance between an output level like e that is below potential gdp and the level of potential gdp is called a recessionary gap
__label__0 because the equilibrium level of real gdp is so low  firms will not wish to hire the full employment number of workers  and unemployment will be high
__label__0 the familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency
__label__1 one typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another
__label__0 remember  the demand curve traces consumers  willingness to pay for different quantities
__label__1 the amount that individuals would have been willing to pay  minus the amount that they actually paid  is called consumer surplus
__label__0 consumer surplus is the area labeled f  that is  the area above the market price and below the demand curve
__label__0 consumer and producer surplus the somewhat triangular area labeled by f shows the area of consumer surplus  which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers were willing to pay
__label__0 first  an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced
__label__1 the loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called deadweight loss
__label__0 in a very real sense  it is like money thrown away that benefits no one
__label__0 the demand and supply model emphasizes that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply  but by the interaction between the two
__label__0 in   the famous economist alfred marshall wrote that asking whether supply or demand determined a price was like arguing  whether it is the upper or the under blade of a pair of scissors that cuts a piece of paper
__label__0 gnetophytes
__label__0 gnetophytes are the closest relative to modern angiosperms  and include three dissimilar genera of plants  ephedra  gnetum  and welwitschia   link
__label__0 like angiosperms  they have broad leaves
__label__0 flowers pollinated by wind are usually small  feathery  and visually inconspicuous
__label__1 sepals and petals together form the perianth
__label__1 the sexual organs  carpels and stamens  are located at the center of the flower
__label__1 stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac  like structure called the anther
__label__1 the filament supports the anther  where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains
__label__1 the filament supports the anther  where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains
__label__0 coevolution of flowering plants and insects is a hypothesis that has received much attention and support  especially because both angiosperms and insects diversified at about the same time in the middle mesozoic
__label__0 many authors have attributed the diversity of plants and insects to pollination and herbivory  or consumption of plants by insects and other animals
__label__0 this is believed to have been as much a driving force as pollination
__label__0 in seed plants  the evolutionary trend led to a dominant sporophyte generation  and at the same time  a systematic reduction in the size of the gametophyte  from a conspicuous structure to a microscopic cluster of cells enclosed in the tissues of the sporophyte
__label__1 whereas lower vascular plants  such as club mosses and ferns  are mostly homosporous  produce only one type of spore   all seed plants  or spermatophytes  are heterosporous
__label__1 they form two types of spores  megaspores  female  and microspores  male
__label__1 the process of animal development begins with the cleavage  or series of mitotic cell divisions  of the zygote   link
__label__0 three cell divisions transform the single  celled zygote into an eight  celled structure
__label__1 more complex animals  those with bilateral symmetry  develop three tissue layers  an inner layer  endoderm   an outer layer  ectoderm   and a middle layer  mesoderm
__label__1 animals with three tissue layers are called triploblasts
__label__0 protostomes include arthropods  mollusks  and annelids
__label__0 deuterostomes include more complex animals such as chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms
__label__0 these two groups are separated based on which opening of the digestive cavity develops first  mouth or anus
__label__0 the bilaterally symmetrical animals are further divided into deuterostomes  including chordates and echinoderms  and two distinct clades of protostomes  including ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans    linkab
__label__1 ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods  they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group  exoskeletal molting  termed ecdysis
__label__0 lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features  each common to certain phyla within the clade
__label__0 while the validity of this claim is still under investigation  these primitive fossils appear to be small  one  centimeter long  sponge  like creatures
__label__0 these fossils from south australia date back  million years  actually placing the putative animal before the great ice age extinction event that marked the transition between the cryogenian period and the ediacaran period
__label__0 until this discovery  most scientists believed that there was no animal life prior to the ediacaran period
__label__0 water can enter into the spongocoel from numerous pores in the body wall
__label__1 water entering the spongocoel is extruded via a large common opening called the osculum
__label__0 however  sponges exhibit a range of diversity in body forms  including variations in the size of the spongocoel  the number of osculi  and where the cells that filter food from the water are located
__label__0 the gel  like consistency of mesohyl acts like an endoskeleton and maintains the tubular morphology of sponges
__label__1 in addition to the osculum  sponges have multiple pores called ostia on their bodies that allow water to enter the sponge
__label__1 in some sponges  ostia are formed by porocytes  single tube  shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into the spongocoel
__label__0 in some sponges  sclerocytes secrete small spicules into the mesohyl  which are composed of either calcium carbonate or silica  depending on the type of sponge
__label__0 these spicules serve to provide additional stiffness to the body of the sponge
__label__0 cnidarians contain specialized cells known as cnidocytes   stinging cells   containing organelles called nematocysts  stingers
__label__1 these cells are present around the mouth and tentacles  and serve to immobilize prey with toxins contained within the cells
__label__1 the outer layer  from ectoderm  is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal  whereas the inner layer  from endoderm  is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive cavity
__label__0 between these two membrane layers is a non  living  jelly  like mesoglea connective layer
__label__0 in terms of cellular complexity  cnidarians show the presence of differentiated cell types in each tissue layer  such as nerve cells  contractile epithelial cells  enzyme  secreting cells  and nutrient  absorbing cells  as well as the presence of intercellular connections
__label__0 the mouth of a sea anemone is surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes
__label__1 the slit  like mouth opening and pharynx are lined by a groove called a siphonophore
__label__1 the pharynx is the muscular part of the digestive system that serves to ingest as well as egest food  and may extend for up to two  thirds the length of the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity
__label__1 the rotifers are a microscopic  about  m to  mm  group of mostly aquatic organisms that get their name from the corona  a rotating  wheel  like structure that is covered with cilia at their anterior end   link
__label__1 the rotifers are a microscopic  about  m to  mm  group of mostly aquatic organisms that get their name from the corona  a rotating  wheel  like structure that is covered with cilia at their anterior end   link
__label__0 although their taxonomy is currently in flux  one treatment places the rotifers in three classes  bdelloidea  monogononta  and seisonidea
__label__0 a unique characteristic of this phylum is the presence of a proboscis enclosed in a rhynchocoel
__label__1 the proboscis serves to capture food and may be ornamented with barbs in some species
__label__0 phylum mollusca is the predominant phylum in marine environments
__label__0 it is estimated that  percent of all known marine species are mollusks  there are over  described species  making them the second most diverse phylum of animals
__label__0 most mollusks are dioecious animals and fertilization occurs externally  although this is not the case in terrestrial mollusks  such as snails and slugs  or in cephalopods
__label__0 in some mollusks  the zygote hatches and undergoes two larval stages  trochophore and veliger  before becoming a young adult  bivalves may exhibit a third larval stage  glochidia
__label__0 these animals are asymmetrical and usually present a coiled shell   link
__label__0 shells may be planospiral  like a garden hose wound up   commonly seen in garden snails  or conispiral   like a spiral staircase   commonly seen in marine conches
__label__0 the phylum includes earthworms  polychaete worms  and leeches
__label__1 annelids show protostomic development in embryonic stages and are often called  segmented worms  due to their key characteristic of metamerism  or true segmentation
__label__0 the number and size of chaetae are greatly diminished in oligochaeta compared to the polychaetes  poly  many  chaetae  hairs
__label__1 the many chetae of polychaetes are also arranged within fleshy  flat  paired appendages that protrude from each segment called parapodia  which may be specialized for different functions in the polychates
__label__0 the subclass hirudinea includes leeches such as hirudo medicinalis and hemiclepsis marginata
__label__0 tagma may be in the form of a head  thorax  and abdomen  or a cephalothorax and abdomen  or a head and trunk
__label__0 a central cavity  called the hemocoel  or blood cavity   is present  and the open circulatory system is regulated by a tubular or single  chambered heart
__label__1 respiratory systems vary depending on the group of arthropod  insects and myriapods use a series of tubes  tracheae  that branch through the body  open to the outside through openings called spiracles  and perform gas exchange directly between the cells and air in the tracheae  whereas aquatic crustaceans utilize gills  terrestrial chelicerates employ book lungs  and aquatic chelicerates use book gills   link
__label__1 most crustaceans are dioecious  which means that the sexes are separate
__label__0 some species like barnacles may be hermaphrodites
__label__1 serial hermaphroditism  where the gonad can switch from producing sperm to ova  may also be seen in some species
__label__0 a  head  tagmum is not usually discernible
__label__1 the phylum derives its name from the first pair of appendages  the chelicerae   link    which are specialized  claw  like or fang  like mouthparts
__label__0 these animals do not possess antennae
__label__0 there are a series of other developmental characteristics that differ between protostomes and deuterostomes  including the mode of formation of the coelom and the early cell division of the embryo
__label__1 in deuterostomes  internal pockets of the endodermal lining called the archenteron fuse to form the coelom
__label__0 the endodermal lining of the archenteron  or the primitive gut  forms membrane protrusions that bud off and become the mesodermal layer
__label__0 these tube feet help in attachment to the substratum
__label__0 these animals possess a true coelom that is modified into a unique circulatory system called a water vascular system
__label__0 an interesting feature of these animals is their power to regenerate  even when over  percent of their body mass is lost
__label__0 characteristics of chordataanimals in the phylum chordata share four key features that appear at some stage during their development  a notochord  a dorsal hollow nerve cord  pharyngeal slits  and a post  anal tail   link
__label__0 in some groups  some of these are present only during embryonic development
__label__1 pharyngeal slits are openings in the pharynx  the region just posterior to the mouth  that extend to the outside environment
__label__1 pharyngeal slits are openings in the pharynx  the region just posterior to the mouth  that extend to the outside environment
__label__0 in organisms that live in aquatic environments  pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding
__label__1 members of urochordata are also known as tunicates   link
__label__0 the name tunicate derives from the cellulose  like carbohydrate material  called the tunic  which covers the outer body of tunicates
__label__1 a cranium is a bony  cartilaginous  or fibrous structure surrounding the brain  jaw  and facial bones   link
__label__0 most bilaterally symmetrical animals have a head  of these  those that have a cranium compose the clade craniata
__label__0 vertebrates display the four characteristic features of the chordates  however  members of this group also share derived characteristics that distinguish them from invertebrate chordates
__label__1 vertebrata is named for the vertebral column  composed of vertebrae  a series of separate bones joined together as a backbone   link
__label__0 in adult vertebrates  the vertebral column replaces the notochord  which is only seen in the embryonic stage
__label__0 the clade myxini includes at least  species of hagfishes
__label__1 hagfishes are eel  like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on dead invertebrates  other fishes  and marine mammals   link
__label__0 hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in oceans around the world  except for the polar regions
__label__1 gnathostomes or  jaw  mouths  are vertebrates that possess jaws
__label__1 one of the most significant developments in early vertebrate evolution was the development of the jaw  which is a hinged structure attached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food
__label__0 electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals
__label__1 sharks  together with most fishes and aquatic and larval amphibians  also have a sense organ called the lateral line  which is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water  and is often considered homologous to  hearing  in terrestrial vertebrates
__label__0 the lateral line is visible as a darker stripe that runs along the length of a fish s body
__label__1 many bony fishes also have a swim bladder  a gas  filled organ that helps to control the buoyancy of the fish
__label__1 bony fishes are further divided into two extant clades  actinopterygii  ray  finned fishes  and sarcopterygii  lobe  finned fishes
__label__0 evolution of tetrapods from fishes represented a significant change in body plan from one suited to organisms that respired and swam in water  to organisms that breathed air and moved onto land  these changes occurred over a span of  million years during the devonian period
__label__0 one of the earliest known tetrapods is from the genus acanthostega
__label__0 acanthostega was aquatic  fossils show that it had gills similar to fishes
__label__0 frogs are amphibians that belong to the order anura   link
__label__0 anurans are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates  with approximately  species that occur on all of the continents except antarctica
__label__1 extra  embryonic membranes are membranes present in amniotic eggs that are not a part of the body of the developing embryo
__label__1 while the inner amniotic membrane surrounds the embryo itself  the chorion surrounds the embryo and yolk sac
__label__0 the chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the egg s external environment
__label__0 the initial split was into synapsids and sauropsids
__label__0 synapsids include all mammals  including extinct mammalian species
__label__0 synapsids also include therapsids  which were mammal  like reptiles from which mammals evolved
__label__1 temporal fenestrae are post  orbital openings in the skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen
__label__1 anapsids have no temporal fenestrae  synapsids have one  and diapsids have two
__label__0 anapsids include extinct organisms and may  based on anatomy  include turtles
__label__0 in cold weather  some reptiles such as the garter snake brumate
__label__1 brumation is similar to hibernation in that the animal becomes less active and can go for long periods without eating  but differs from hibernation in that brumating reptiles are not asleep or living off fat reserves
__label__0 rather  their metabolism is slowed in response to cold temperatures  and the animal is very sluggish
__label__0 crocodilia   small lizard   arose with a distinct lineage by the middle triassic  extant species include alligators  crocodiles  and caimans
__label__0 crocodilians   link   live throughout the tropics and subtropics of africa  south america  southern florida  asia  and australia
__label__0 turtles are members of the clade testudines   having a shell     link
__label__0 turtles are characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell
__label__0 sebaceous glands are located over most of the body
__label__1 eccrine glands produce sweat  or perspiration  which is mainly composed of water
__label__0 in most mammals  eccrine glands are limited to certain areas of the body  and some mammals do not possess them at all
__label__0 the skeletal system of mammals possesses many unique features
__label__0 the lower jaw of mammals consists of only one bone  the dentary
__label__0 the jaws of other vertebrates are composed of more than one bone
__label__0 there are three living species of monotremes  the platypus and two species of echidnas  or spiny anteaters
__label__0 the leathery  beaked platypus belongs to the family ornithorhynchidae   bird beak    whereas echidnas belong to the family tachyglossidae   sticky tongue     link
__label__0 some examples are insectivora  the insect eaters  edentata  the toothless anteaters  rodentia  the rodents  cetacea  the aquatic mammals including whales  carnivora  carnivorous mammals including dogs  cats  and bears  and primates  which includes humans
__label__1 eutherian mammals are sometimes called placental mammals because all species possess a complex placenta that connects a fetus to the mother  allowing for gas  fluid  and nutrient exchange
__label__0 while other mammals possess a less complex placenta or briefly have a placenta  all eutherians possess a complex placenta during gestation
__label__0 two types of flight feathers are found on the wings  primary feathers and secondary feathers
__label__1 primary feathers are located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust
__label__1 secondary feathers are located closer to the body  attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift
__label__0 the sternum of birds is larger than that of other vertebrates  which accommodates the large muscles required to generate enough upward force to generate lift with the flapping of the wings
__label__1 another skeletal modification found in most birds is the fusion of the two clavicles  collarbones   forming the furcula or wishbone
__label__1 another skeletal modification found in most birds is the fusion of the two clavicles  collarbones   forming the furcula or wishbone
__label__0 the furcula is flexible enough to bend and provide support to the shoulder girdle during flapping
__label__0 the second group  bipedal predators called theropods  includes birds
__label__0 this course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds  specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones  as well as the presence of the wishbone  formed by the fusing of the clavicles
__label__1 one important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is archaeopteryx  which is from the jurassic period   link
__label__0 archaeopteryx is important in establishing the relationship between birds and dinosaurs  because it is an intermediate fossil  meaning it has characteristics of both dinosaurs and birds
__label__0 order primates of class mammalia includes lemurs  tarsiers  monkeys  apes  and humans
__label__0 non  human primates live primarily in the tropical or subtropical regions of south america  africa  and asia
__label__0 order primates is divided into two groups  prosimians and anthropoids
__label__0 prosimians include the bush babies of africa  the lemurs of madagascar  and the lorises  pottos  and tarsiers of southeast asia
__label__0 anthropoids include monkeys  apes  and humans
__label__1 by  million years ago  evidence indicates that monkeys were present in the new world  south america  and the old world  africa and asia
__label__0 new world monkeys are also called platyrrhini  a reference to their broad noses   link
__label__0 old world monkeys are called catarrhini  a reference to their narrow noses
__label__0 the lesser apes comprise the family hylobatidae  including gibbons and siamangs
__label__1 the great apes include the genera pan  chimpanzees and bonobos    linka   gorilla  gorillas   pongo  orangutans   and homo  humans    link  b
__label__1 the very arboreal gibbons are smaller than the great apes  they have low sexual dimorphism  that is  the sexes are not markedly different in size   and they have relatively longer arms used for swinging through trees
__label__0 the  a  chimpanzee is one of the great apes
__label__1 australopithecus   southern ape   is a genus of hominin that evolved in eastern africa approximately  million years ago and went extinct about  million years ago
__label__0 this genus is of particular interest to us as it is thought that our genus  genus homo  evolved from a common ancestor shared with australopithecus about  million years ago  after likely passing through some transitional states
__label__0 vascular plants have two distinct organ systems  a shoot system  and a root system
__label__1 the shoot system consists of two portions  the vegetative  non  reproductive  parts of the plant  such as the leaves and the stems  and the reproductive parts of the plant  which include flowers and fruits
__label__0 the shoot system generally grows above ground  where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis
__label__1 cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems  which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth
__label__1 meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated  and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant
__label__1 in contrast  permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing
__label__1 apical meristems contain meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots  which enable a plant to extend in length
__label__1 lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant
__label__1 intercalary meristems occur only in monocots  at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes  the areas where leaves attach to a stem
__label__1 dermal tissue covers and protects the plant  and vascular tissue transports water  minerals  and sugars to different parts of the plant
__label__1 ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis  provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue  and helps to store water and sugars
__label__1 nodes are points of attachment for leaves  aerial roots  and flowers
__label__1 the stem region between two nodes is called an internode
__label__1 the stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole
__label__0 parenchyma cells are the most common plant cells   link
__label__0 they are found in the stem  the root  the inside of the leaf  and the pulp of the fruit
__label__1 the dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis  a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying tissue
__label__1 woody plants have a tough  waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark  which further protects the plant from damage
__label__1 two cells  known as guard cells  surround each leaf stoma  controlling its opening and closing and thus regulating the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen and water vapor
__label__1 trichomes are hair  like structures on the epidermal surface
__label__0 they help to reduce transpiration  the loss of water by aboveground plant parts   increase solar reflectance  and store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores
__label__0 openings called stomata  singular  stoma  allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and water vapor
__label__1 water moves from one tracheid to another through regions on the side walls known as pits  where secondary walls are absent
__label__1 vessel elements are xylem cells with thinner walls  they are shorter than tracheids
__label__0 each vessel element is connected to the next by means of a perforation plate at the end walls of the element
__label__0 ground tissue is mostly made up of parenchyma cells  but may also contain collenchyma and sclerenchyma cells that help support the stem
__label__1 the ground tissue towards the interior of the vascular tissue in a stem or root is known as pith  while the layer of tissue between the vascular tissue and the epidermis is known as the cortex
__label__0 the cork cambium also produces a layer of cells known as phelloderm  which grows inward from the cambium
__label__1 the cork cambium  cork cells  and phelloderm are collectively termed the periderm
__label__0 the periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants
__label__0 vertical shoots may arise from the buds on the rhizome of some plants  such as ginger and ferns
__label__0 corms are similar to rhizomes  except they are more rounded and fleshy  such as in gladiolus
__label__0 corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter
__label__1 runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals  strawberries are an example
__label__1 tubers are modified stems that may store starch  as seen in the potato  solanum sp
__label__0 tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons  and contain many adventitious or unusual buds  familiar to us as the  eyes  on potatoes
__label__1 tendrils are slender  twining strands that enable a plant  like a vine or pumpkin  to seek support by climbing on other surfaces
__label__1 thorns are modified branches appearing as sharp outgrowths that protect the plant  common examples include roses  osage orange and devil s walking stick
__label__0 a tap root system penetrates deep into the soil
__label__1 in contrast  a fibrous root system is located closer to the soil surface  and forms a dense network of roots that also helps prevent soil erosion  lawn grasses are a good example  as are wheat  rice  and corn
__label__0 some plants have a combination of tap roots and fibrous roots
__label__1 the vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root  which is called the stele   link
__label__1 a layer of cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root
__label__0 this ensures that only materials required by the root pass through the endodermis  while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded
__label__1 the outermost cell layer of the root s vascular tissue is the pericycle  an area that can give rise to lateral roots
__label__1 in dicot roots  the xylem and phloem of the stele are arranged alternately in an x shape  whereas in monocot roots  the vascular tissue is arranged in a ring around the pith
__label__0 some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole
__label__1 leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves
__label__1 small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules
__label__1 the arrangement of leaves on a stem is known as phyllotaxy
__label__0 the number and placement of a plant s leaves will vary depending on the species  with each species exhibiting a characteristic leaf arrangement
__label__1 in a simple leaf  the blade is either completely undivided  as in the banana leaf  or it has lobes  but the separation does not reach the midrib  as in the maple leaf
__label__1 in a compound leaf  the leaf blade is completely divided  forming leaflets  as in the locust tree
__label__0 each leaflet may have its own stalk  but is attached to the rachis
__label__0 the epidermis is usually one cell layer thick  however  in plants that grow in very hot or very cold conditions  the epidermis may be several layers thick to protect against excessive water loss from transpiration
__label__1 a waxy layer known as the cuticle covers the leaves of all plant species
__label__0 the cuticle reduces the rate of water loss from the leaf surface
__label__1 transpiration is the loss of water from the plant through evaporation at the leaf surface
__label__0 it is the main driver of water movement in the xylem
__label__1 structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources
__label__1 sugars produced in sources  such as leaves  need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation
__label__0 plants have a number of sophisticated uses for light that go far beyond their ability to photosynthesize low  molecular  weight sugars using only carbon dioxide  light  and water
__label__1 photomorphogenesis is the growth and development of plants in response to light
__label__0 it allows plants to optimize their use of light and space
__label__0 the sensing of light in the environment is important to plants  it can be crucial for competition and survival
__label__1 the response of plants to light is mediated by different photoreceptors  which are comprised of a protein covalently bonded to a light  absorbing pigment called a chromophore
__label__1 the response of plants to light is mediated by different photoreceptors  which are comprised of a protein covalently bonded to a light  absorbing pigment called a chromophore
__label__0 together  the two are called a chromoprotein
__label__0 most activation occurs on the lit side  causing the plant hormone indole acetic acid  iaa  to accumulate on the shaded side
__label__0 stem cells elongate under influence of iaa
__label__1 cryptochromes are another class of blue  light absorbing photoreceptors that also contain a flavin  based chromophore
__label__1 cryptochromes set the plants hour activity cycle  also know as its circadian rhythem  using blue light cues
__label__0 cryptochromes set the plants hour activity cycle  also know as its circadian rhythem  using blue light cues
__label__0 the term auxin is derived from the greek word auxein  which means
__label__1 auxins are the main hormones responsible for cell elongation in phototropism and gravitropism
__label__0 they also control the differentiation of meristem into vascular tissue  and promote leaf development and arrangement
__label__1 gibberellins  gas  are a group of about  closely related plant hormones that stimulate shoot elongation  seed germination  and fruit and flower maturation
__label__0 gas are synthesized in the root and stem apical meristems  young leaves  and seed embryos
__label__0 jasmonates play a major role in defense responses to herbivory
__label__0 their levels increase when a plant is wounded by a predator  resulting in an increase in toxic secondary metabolites
__label__1 the movement of a plant subjected to constant directional pressure is called thigmotropism  from the greek words thigma meaning  touch   and tropism implying  direction   tendrils are one example of this
__label__0 the meristematic region of tendrils is very touch sensitive  light touch will evoke a quick coiling response
__label__0 plant nutrients may be composed of either organic or inorganic compounds
__label__1 an organic compound is a chemical compound that contains carbon  such as carbon dioxide obtained from the atmosphere
__label__0 carbon that was obtained from atmospheric co composes the majority of the dry mass within most plants
__label__0 the essential elements can be divided into two groups  macronutrients and micronutrients
__label__1 nutrients that plants require in larger amounts are called macronutrients
__label__0 about half of the essential elements are considered macronutrients  carbon  hydrogen  oxygen  nitrogen  phosphorus  potassium  calcium  magnesium and sulfur
__label__0 soil develops very slowly over long periods of time  and its formation results from natural and environmental forces acting on mineral  rock  and organic compounds
__label__1 soils can be divided into two groups  organic soils are those that are formed from sedimentation and primarily composed of organic matter  while those that are formed from the weathering of rocks and are primarily composed of inorganic material are called mineral soils
__label__0 the basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method  also known as the dideoxy method   which was developed by fred sanger in the s
__label__0 the chain termination method involves dna replication of a single  stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide  dntp   which is a monomer  or a single unit  of dna
__label__1 the chain termination method involves dna replication of a single  stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide  dntp   which is a monomer  or a single unit  of dna
__label__0 the primer and dntp are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides  ddntps
__label__0 by matching up overlapping sequences at the end of each fragment  the entire dna sequence can be reformed
__label__1 a larger sequence that is assembled from overlapping shorter sequences is called a contig
__label__0 as an analogy  consider that someone has four copies of a landscape photograph that you have never seen before and know nothing about how it should appear
__label__0 a lot of basic research is performed in model organisms because the information can be applied to genetically similar organisms
__label__1 a model organism is a species that is studied as a model to understand the biological processes in other species represented by the model organism
__label__0 having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms
__label__1 a proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type
__label__0 proteomes can be studied using the knowledge of genomes because genes code for mrnas  and the mrnas encode proteins
__label__1 metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism
__label__1 the metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism
__label__0 metabolomics offers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics  as well as genetic makeup and environmental factors
__label__0 the current problem with using biomarkers for the early detection of cancer is the high rate of false  negative results
__label__1 a false negative is an incorrect test result that should have been positive
__label__0 in other words  many cases of cancer go undetected  which makes biomarkers unreliable
__label__1 traditionally  microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions  which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory
__label__0 because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours  their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly
__label__0 natural selection can only take place if there is variation  or differences  among individuals in a population
__label__0 importantly  these differences must have some genetic basis  otherwise  the selection will not lead to change in the next generation
__label__0 however  the wings of bats and insects have evolved from very different original structures
__label__1 this phenomenon is called convergent evolution  where similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a common ancestry
__label__0 the two species came to the same function  flying  but did so separately from each other  these physical changes occur over enormous spans of time and help explain how evolution occurs
__label__0 individual organisms will mate with any nearby individual who they are capable of breeding with
__label__1 an area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce  forming hybrids  is called a hybrid zone
__label__0 over time  the hybrid zone may change depending on the fitness of the hybrids and the reproductive barriers   link
__label__1 in the gradual speciation model  species diverge gradually over time in small steps
__label__1 in the punctuated equilibrium model  a new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species  and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time afterward   link
__label__0 this early change model is called punctuated equilibrium  because it begins with a punctuated or periodic change and then remains in balance afterward
__label__1 given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation  the formation of two species from one original species
__label__0 darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only illustration found in on the origin of species   link  a
__label__0 biologists group allopatric processes into two categories  dispersal and vicariance
__label__1 dispersal is when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area  and vicariance is when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms
__label__1 the other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring called an allopolyploid
__label__0 the prefix  allo  means  other   recall from allopatric   therefore  an allopolyploid occurs when gametes from two different species combine
__label__1 therefore  a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place  this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction
__label__1 a postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation  this includes organisms that do nt survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile
__label__1 behavioral isolation occurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction from taking place
__label__0 for example  male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females
__label__0 initially  the newly discovered particulate nature of genes made it difficult for biologists to understand how gradual evolution could occur
__label__1 but over the next few decades genetics and evolution were integrated in what became known as the modern synthesis  the coherent understanding of the relationship between natural selection and genetics that took shape by the s and is generally accepted today
__label__0 in sum  the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes  such as natural selection  can affect a population s genetic makeup  and  in turn  how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species
__label__1 the allele frequency  or gene frequency  is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population
__label__0 until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms  but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change
__label__0 if these are the only two possible alleles for a given locus in the population  p  q
__label__0 in other words  all the p alleles and all the q alleles make up all of the alleles for that locus that are found in the population  but what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles  but the frequencies of the resulting genotypes  known as the population s genetic structure  from which scientists can surmise the distribution of phenotypes
__label__0 if the phenotype is observed  only the genotype of the homozygous recessive alleles can be known  the calculations provide an estimate of the remaining genotypes
__label__1 the diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called genetic variance
__label__0 when scientists are involved in the breeding of a species  such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves  they try to increase a population s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can
__label__0 over time  the genes for bigger size will increase in frequency in the population  and the population will  as a result  grow larger on average
__label__0 that is  this would occur if this particular selection pressure  or driving selective force  were the only one acting on the population
__label__0 in other examples  better camouflage or a stronger resistance to drought might pose a selection pressure
__label__1 another important evolutionary force is gene flow  the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the migration of individuals or gametes   link
__label__0 while some populations are fairly stable  others experience more flux
__label__0 geographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the phenotypic variation between those populations
__label__0 such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant
__label__1 one type of geographic variation  called a cline  can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient
__label__1 an individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that  for example  increases the ability to reproduce  fecundity   but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a fatal childhood disease  that fecundity phenotype will not be passed on to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age
__label__1 natural selection acts at the level of the individual  it selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next generation  known as an organism s evolutionary  darwinian  fitness
__label__1 when the environment changes  populations will often undergo directional selection   link    which selects for phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation
__label__0 a classic example of this type of selection is the evolution of the peppered moth in eighteenth  and nineteenth  century england
__label__1 males are often larger  for example  and display many elaborate colors and adornments  like the peacock s tail  while females tend to be smaller and duller in decoration
__label__0 such differences are known as sexual dimorphisms   link    which arise from the fact that in many populations  particularly animal populations  there is more variance in the reproductive success of the males than there is of the females
__label__0 that is  some males  often the bigger  stronger  or more decorated males  get the vast majority of the total matings  while others receive none
__label__1 in   biologist ronald fisher proposed another model of sexual selection  the fisherian runaway model  which suggests that selection of certain traits is a result of sexual preference  in both the handicap principle and the good genes hypothesis  the trait is said to be an honest signal of the males  quality  thus giving females a way to find the fittest mates  males that will pass the best genes to their offspring
__label__0 many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor
__label__0 scientists call such trees rooted  which means there is a single ancestral lineage  typically drawn from the bottom or left  to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate
__label__0 notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains  bacteria  archaea  and eukarya  diverge from a single point and branch off
__label__1 a lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon
__label__1 when two lineages stem from the same branch point  they are called sister taxa
__label__1 a branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships
__label__1 taxonomy  which literally means  arrangement law   is the science of classifying organisms to construct internationally shared classification systems with each organism placed into more and more inclusive groupings
__label__0 think about how a grocery store is organized
__label__1 with the advancement of dna technology  the area of molecular systematics  which describes the use of information on the molecular level including dna analysis  has blossomed
__label__0 new computer programs not only confirm many earlier classified organisms  but also uncover previously made errors
__label__1 if a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group  it is considered a shared ancestral character because all of the organisms in the taxon or clade have that trait
__label__0 the vertebrate in  link  is a shared ancestral character
__label__1 horizontal gene transfer  hgt  is the introduction of genetic material from one species to another species by mechanisms other than the vertical transmission from parents  to offspring
__label__0 these transfers allow even distantly related species to share genes  influencing their phenotypes
__label__1 the nucleus  first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first   linka   followed by a later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria
__label__1 the mitochondria  first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host   link  b   which subsequently acquired a nucleus  by fusion or other mechanisms  to become the first eukaryotic cell
__label__1 as shown in  linka  some individual prokaryotes were responsible for transferring the bacteria that caused mitochondrial development to the new eukaryotes  whereas other species transferred the bacteria that gave rise to chloroplasts
__label__0 this model is often called the  web of life
__label__0 in an effort to save the tree analogy  some have proposed using the ficus tree   link  b  with its multiple trunks as a phylogenetic to represent a diminished evolutionary role for hgt
__label__1 in the  a  phylogenetic model proposed by w ford doolittle  the  tree of life  arose from a community of ancestral cells  has multiple trunks  and has connections between branches where horizontal gene transfer has occurred
__label__0 visually  this concept is better represented by  b  the multi  trunked ficus than by the single trunk of the oak similar to the tree drawn by darwin  link
__label__1 all virions have a nucleic acid genome covered by a protective layer of proteins  called a capsid
__label__0 the capsid is made up of protein subunits called capsomeres
__label__0 some viral capsids are simple polyhedral  spheres   whereas others are quite complex in structure  in general  the shapes of viruses are classified into four groups  filamentous  isometric  or icosahedral   enveloped  and head and tail
__label__0 unlike nearly all living organisms that use dna as their genetic material  viruses may use either dna or rna as theirs
__label__0 the virus core contains the genome or total genetic content of the virus
__label__0 viral genomes tend to be small  containing only those genes that encode proteins that the virus can not get from the host cell
__label__0 they convert their single  stranded genomes into a dsdna intermediate before transcription to mrna can occur
__label__0 group iii viruses use dsrna as their genome
__label__0 the strands separate  and one of them is used as a template for the generation of mrna using the rna  dependent rna polymerase encoded by the virus
__label__0 then  mrna can be produced by transcription of the viral dna that was integrated into the host genome
__label__0 group vii viruses have partial dsdna genomes and make ssrna intermediates that act as mrna  but are also converted back into dsdna genomes by reverse transcriptase  necessary for genome replication
__label__0 the characteristics of each group in the baltimore classification are summarized in  link  with examples of each group
__label__1 these changes  called cytopathic  causing cell damage  effects  can change cell functions or even destroy the cell
__label__1 some infected cells  such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus  die through lysis  bursting  or apoptosis  programmed cell death or  cell suicide    releasing all progeny virions at once
__label__0 the symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus  which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body  and from cell damage caused by the virus
__label__1 bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria   link
__label__0 when infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions  the infection is said to be productive
__label__0 sometimes  however  a virus can remain within the cell without being released
__label__0 for example  when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell  it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle   link    and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell
__label__1 when the phage dna is incorporated into the host cell genome  it is called a prophage
__label__0 the viral genome is then  injected  into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that used by many bacteriophages
__label__0 enveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors  receptor  mediated endocytosis  or fusion
__label__0 many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor  mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to some non  enveloped viruses
__label__0 other viruses cause long  term chronic infections  such as the virus causing hepatitis c  whereas others  like herpes simplex virus  only cause intermittent symptoms
__label__1 still other viruses  such as human herpesviruses  and   which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola  often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host  and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection
__label__1 when plants viruses are transferred between different plants  this is known as horizontal transmission  and when they are inherited from a parent  this is called vertical transmission  symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host   link
__label__1 one common symptom is hyperplasia  the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls
__label__0 other viruses induce hypoplasia  or decreased cell growth  in the leaves of plants  causing thin  yellow areas to appear
__label__1 while we do have limited numbers of effective antiviral drugs  such as those used to treat hiv and influenza  the primary method of controlling viral disease is by vaccination  which is intended to prevent outbreaks by building immunity to a virus or virus family   link
__label__0 vaccines may be prepared using live viruses  killed viruses  or molecular subunits of the virus
__label__0 the killed viral vaccines and subunit viruses are both incapable of causing disease
__label__0 the study of viruses has led to the development of a variety of new ways to treat non  viral diseases
__label__0 viruses have been used in gene therapy
__label__1 gene therapy is used to treat genetic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency  scid   a heritable  recessive disease in which children are born with severely compromised immune systems
__label__1 prions and viroids are pathogens  agents with the ability to cause disease  that have simpler structures than viruses but  in the case of prions  still can produce deadly diseases
__label__1 viroidsviroids are plant pathogens  small  single  stranded  circular rna particles that are much simpler than a virus
__label__0 they do not have a capsid or outer envelope  but like viruses can reproduce only within a host cell
__label__0 the first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents
__label__1 a hydrothermal vent is a breakage or fissure in the earth s surface that releases geothermally heated water
__label__0 with the evolution of photosynthesis about  billion years ago  some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use a more widely available energy source  sunlight  whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food
__label__1 evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of earth s existence  the atmosphere was anoxic  meaning that there was no molecular oxygen
__label__1 therefore  only those organisms that can grow without oxygen  anaerobic organisms  were able to live
__label__1 autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs  and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of earth
__label__1 other bacteria and archaea are adapted to grow under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles  meaning  lovers of extremes
__label__0 extremophiles have been found in all kinds of environments  the depth of the oceans  hot springs  the artic and the antarctic  in very dry places  deep inside earth  in harsh chemical environments  and in high radiation environments   link    just to mention a few
__label__0 these organisms give us a better understanding of prokaryotic diversity and open up the possibility of finding new prokaryotic species that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic drugs or have industrial applications
__label__0 the criteria for entering into the vbnc state are not completely understood
__label__0 in a process called resuscitation  the prokaryote can go back to  normal  life when environmental conditions improve
__label__0 for example  the capsule found in some species enables the organism to attach to surfaces  protects it from dehydration and attack by phagocytic cells  and makes pathogens more resistant to our immune responses
__label__0 some species also have flagella  singular  flagellum  used for locomotion  and pili  singular  pilus  used for attachment to surfaces
__label__0 plasmids  which consist of extra  chromosomal dna  are also present in many species of bacteria and archaea
__label__0 bacteria are divided into two major groups  gram positive and gram negative  based on their reaction to gram staining
__label__1 note that all gram  positive bacteria belong to one phylum  bacteria in the other phyla  proteobacteria  chlamydias  spirochetes  cyanobacteria  and others  are gram  negative
__label__1 in transformation  the prokaryote takes in dna found in its environment that is shed by other prokaryotes
__label__0 if a nonpathogenic bacterium takes up dna for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new dna into its own chromosome  it too may become pathogenic
__label__0 recall that macromolecules are produced by the polymerization of smaller units called monomers
__label__0 for cells to build all of the molecules required to sustain life  they need certain substances  collectively called nutrients
__label__0 when prokaryotes grow in nature  they obtain their nutrients from the environment
__label__0 consumers such as animals use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere
__label__1 then  bacteria and fungi  collectively called decomposers  carry out the breakdown  decomposition  of plants and animals and their organic compounds
__label__0 the most important contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is microbial decomposition of dead material  dead animals  plants  and humus  that undergo respiration
__label__0 ammonia is catabolized anaerobically by some prokaryotes  yielding n as the final product
__label__1 nitrification is the conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate
__label__0 nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria belonging to the genera nitrosomas  nitrobacter  and nitrospira
__label__1 an epidemic is a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time
__label__1 a pandemic is a widespread  usually worldwide  epidemic
__label__1 an endemic disease is a disease that is constantly present  usually at low incidence  in a population
__label__0 therefore  changes in the environment  the pathogen  or the host population can dramatically impact the spread of a disease
__label__1 according to the world health organization  who  an emerging disease   link   is one that has appeared in a population for the first time  or that may have existed previously but is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range
__label__0 this definition also includes re  emerging diseases that were previously under control
__label__1 for example  staphylococcus aureus  often called  staph   is a common bacterium that can live in the human body and is usually easily treated with antibiotics
__label__0 a very dangerous strain  however  methicillin  resistant staphylococcus aureus  mrsa  has made the news over the past few years   link
__label__0 this strain is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics  including methicillin  amoxicillin  penicillin  and oxacillin
__label__0 although the united states has one of the safest food supplies in the world  the us centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  has reported that   million people get sick  more than  are hospitalized  and  americans die each year from foodborne illness  the characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time
__label__1 in the past  it was relatively common to hear about sporadic cases of botulism  the potentially fatal disease produced by a toxin from the anaerobic bacterium clostridium botulinum
__label__0 some of the most common sources for this bacterium were non  acidic canned foods  homemade pickles  and processed meat and sausages
__label__0 symbionts may fix more nitrogen in soils than free  living organisms by a factor of
__label__1 soil bacteria  collectively called rhizobia  are able to symbiotically interact with legumes to form nodules  specialized structures where nitrogen fixation occurs   link
__label__1 nitrogenase  the enzyme that fixes nitrogen  is inactivated by oxygen  so the nodule provides an oxygen  free area for nitrogen fixation to take place
__label__0 in order to understand eukaryotic organisms fully  it is necessary to understand that all extant eukaryotes are descendants of a chimeric organism that was a composite of a host cell and the cell  s  of an alpha  proteobacterium that  took up residence  inside it
__label__1 this major theme in the origin of eukaryotes is known as endosymbiosis  one cell engulfing another such that the engulfed cell survives and both cells benefit
__label__0 over many generations  a symbiotic relationship can result in two organisms that depend on each other so completely that neither could survive on its own
__label__0 protist cells may be enveloped by animal  like cell membranes or plant  like cell walls
__label__0 others are encased in glassy silica  based shells or wound with pellicles of interlocking protein strips
__label__1 the pellicle functions like a flexible coat of armor  preventing the protist from being torn or pierced without compromising its range of motion
__label__0 until recently  these protists were believed to lack mitochondria
__label__1 mitochondrial remnant organelles  called mitosomes  have since been identified in diplomonads  but these mitosomes are essentially nonfunctional
__label__1 diplomonads exist in anaerobic environments and use alternative pathways  such as glycolysis  to generate energy
__label__0 together  the flagella contribute to the characteristic spinning motion of dinoflagellates
__label__1 these protists exist in freshwater and marine habitats  and are a component of plankton  the typically microscopic organisms that drift through the water and serve as a crucial food source for larger aquatic organisms
__label__0 most species of diatoms reproduce asexually  although some instances of sexual reproduction and sporulation also exist
__label__0 some diatoms exhibit a slit in their silica shell  called a raphe
__label__0 by expelling a stream of mucopolysaccharides from the raphe  the diatom can attach to surfaces or propel itself in one direction
__label__1 foraminiferans  or forams  are unicellular heterotrophic protists  ranging from approximately  micrometers to several centimeters in length  and occasionally resembling tiny snails   link
__label__1 as a group  the forams exhibit porous shells  called tests that are built from various organic materials and typically hardened with calcium carbonate
__label__0 the tests may house photosynthetic algae  which the forams can harvest for nutrition
__label__0 in addition  their mode of nutrition was poorly understood
__label__1 progress in the field of fungal biology was the result of mycology  the scientific study of fungi
__label__0 based on fossil evidence  fungi appeared in the pre  cambrian era  about  million years ago
__label__0 they display two distinct morphological stages  the vegetative and reproductive
__label__1 the vegetative stage consists of a tangle of slender thread  like structures called hyphae  singular  hypha   whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous
__label__1 the mass of hyphae is a mycelium   link
__label__0 the hyphae in bread molds  which belong to the phylum zygomycota  are not separated by septa
__label__0 instead  they are formed by large cells containing many nuclei  an arrangement described as coenocytic hyphae   link  b
__label__1 other species  such as the chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle  are are obligate anaerobes  in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them
__label__0 yeasts are intermediate  being faculative anaerobes
__label__1 this means that they grow best in the presence of oxygen using aerobic respiration  but can survive using anaerobic respiration when oxygen is not available
__label__0 spores allow fungi to expand their distribution and colonize new environments
__label__0 they may be released from the parent thallus either outside or within a special reproductive sac called a sporangium
__label__0 although there are many variations in fungal sexual reproduction  all include the following three stages   link
__label__1 first  during plasmogamy  literally   marriage or union of cytoplasm    two haploid cells fuse  leading to a dikaryotic stage where two haploid nuclei coexist in a single cell
__label__1 during karyogamy   nuclear marriage    the haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote nucleus
__label__1 the zygomycetes are a relatively small group of fungi belonging to the phylum zygomycota
__label__0 they include the familiar bread mold  rhizopus stolonifer  which rapidly propagates on the surfaces of breads  fruits  and vegetables
__label__0 in each ascus  two or more haploid ascospores fuse their nuclei in karyogamy
__label__1 during sexual reproduction  thousands of asci fill a fruiting body called the ascocarp
__label__0 the diploid nucleus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis
__label__0 asexual ascomycota and basidiomycotaimperfect fungi  those that do not display a sexual phase  use to be classified in the form phylum deuteromycota   a classification group no longer used in the present  ever  developing classification of organisms
__label__0 while deuteromycota use to be a classification group  recent moleclular analysis has shown that the members classified in this group belong to the ascomycota or the basidiomycota classifications
__label__0 fossil records indicate that trees and their root symbionts share a long evolutionary history
__label__1 it appears that all members of this family form arbuscular mycorrhizae  the hyphae interact with the root cells forming a mutually beneficial association where the plants supply the carbon source and energy in the form of carbohydrates to the fungus  and the fungus supplies essential minerals from the soil to the plant
__label__0 the glomeromycetes do not reproduce sexually and do not survive without the presence of plant roots
__label__0 although they have coenocytic hyphae like the zygomycetes  they do not form zygospores
__label__0 fungi can affect animals  including humans  in several ways
__label__1 a mycosis is a fungal disease that results from infection and direct damage
__label__0 fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues
__label__0 one of the most remarkable associations between fungi and plants is the establishment of mycorrhizae
__label__1 mycorrhiza  which comes from the greek words myco meaning fungus and rhizo meaning root  refers to the association between vascular plant roots and their symbiotic fungi
__label__0 somewhere between  and  percent of all plant species have mycorrhizal partners
__label__1 lichens display a range of colors and textures   link   and can survive in the most unusual and hostile habitats
__label__0 they cover rocks  gravestones  tree bark  and the ground in the tundra where plant roots can not penetrate
__label__1 in both seedless and seed plants  the female gametophyte provides protection and nutrients to the embryo as it develops into the new generation of sporophyte
__label__0 this distinguishing feature of land plants gave the group its alternate name of embryophytes
__label__0 after germinating from a spore  the resulting gametophyte produces both male and female gametangia  usually on the same individual
__label__1 in contrast  heterosporous plants produce two morphologically different types of spores
__label__1 the male spores are called microspores  because of their smaller size  and develop into the male gametophyte  the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte
__label__1 the spores of seedless plants are surrounded by thick cell walls containing a tough polymer known as sporopollenin
__label__0 this complex substance is characterized by long chains of organic molecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids  hence the yellow color of most pollen
__label__0 the male gametangium  antheridium  releases sperm
__label__0 many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia  the female gametangium
__label__1 the embryo develops inside the archegonium as the sporophyte
__label__1 cells in green algae divide along cell plates called phragmoplasts  and their cell walls are layered in the same manner as the cell walls of embryophytes
__label__1 consequently  land plants and closely related green algae are now part of a new monophyletic group called streptophyta
__label__0 the hornworts  anthocerotophyta  belong to the broad bryophyte group
__label__0 they have colonized a variety of habitats on land  although they are never far from a source of moisture
__label__0 the moss lifecycle follows the pattern of alternation of generations as shown in  link
__label__1 the most familiar structure is the haploid gametophyte  which germinates from a haploid spore and forms first a protonema  usually  a tangle of single  celled filaments that hug the ground
__label__1 the most familiar structure is the haploid gametophyte  which germinates from a haploid spore and forms first a protonema  usually  a tangle of single  celled filaments that hug the ground
__label__0 cells akin to an apical meristem actively divide and give rise to a gametophore  consisting of a photosynthetic stem and foliage  like structures
__label__1 the vascular plants  or tracheophytes  are the dominant and most conspicuous group of land plants
__label__0 more than  species of tracheophytes represent more than  percent of earth s vegetation
__label__1 phloem is the second type of vascular tissue  it transports sugars  proteins  and other solutes throughout the plant
__label__0 phloem cells are divided into sieve elements  conducting cells  and cells that support the sieve elements
__label__0 microphylls may have originated from the flattening of lateral branches  or from sporangia that lost their reproductive capabilities
__label__1 microphylls are present in the club mosses and probably preceded the development of megaphylls  or  big leaves   which are larger leaves with a pattern of branching veins
__label__1 microphylls are present in the club mosses and probably preceded the development of megaphylls  or  big leaves   which are larger leaves with a pattern of branching veins
__label__0 megaphylls most likely appeared independently several times during the course of evolution
__label__1 the club mosses  or phylum lycopodiophyta  are the earliest group of seedless vascular plants
__label__0 they dominated the landscape of the carboniferous  growing into tall trees and forming large swamp forests
__label__0 phylum monilophyta  class psilotopsida  ferns
__label__0 with their large fronds  ferns are the most readily recognizable seedless vascular plants
__label__1 they are considered the most advanced seedless vascular plants and display characteristics commonly observed in seed plants
__label__1 gymnosperms  meaning  naked seeds   are a diverse group of seed plants and are paraphyletic
__label__1 paraphyletic groups are those in which not all members are descendants of a single common ancestor
__label__0 the male and female reproductive organs can form in cones or strobili
__label__1 male and female sporangia are produced either on the same plant  described as monoecious   one home  or bisexual   or on separate plants  referred to as dioecious   two homes  or unisexual  plants
__label__0 the life cycle of a conifer will serve as our example of reproduction in gymnosperms
__label__0 female cones  or ovulate cones  contain two ovules per scale
__label__0 one megaspore mother cell  or megasporocyte  undergoes meiosis in each ovule
__label__1 individuals who experience depersonalization might believe their thoughts and feelings are not their own  they may feel robotic as though they lack control over their movements and speech  they may experience a distorted sense of time and  in extreme cases  they may sense an  out  of  body  experience in which they see themselves from the vantage point of another person
__label__1 derealization is conceptualized as a sense of  unreality or detachment from  or unfamiliarity with  the world  be it individuals  inanimate objects  or all surroundings   apa    p
__label__0 a person who experiences derealization might feel as though he is in a fog or a dream  or that the surrounding world is somehow artificial and unreal
__label__1 these kinds of delusions are known as paranoid delusions  which involve the  false  belief that other people or agencies are plotting to harm the person
__label__1 people with schizophrenia also may hold grandiose delusions  beliefs that one holds special power  unique knowledge  or is extremely important
__label__0 for example  the person who claims to be jesus christ  or who claims to have knowledge going back  years  or who claims to be a great philosopher is experiencing grandiose delusions
__label__1 disorganized or abnormal motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements  becoming unusually active  exhibiting silly child  like behaviors  giggling and self  absorbed smiling   engaging in repeated and purposeless movements  or displaying odd facial expressions and gestures
__label__1 in some cases  the person will exhibit catatonic behaviors  which show decreased reactivity to the environment  such as posturing  in which the person maintains a rigid and bizarre posture for long periods of time  or catatonic stupor  a complete lack of movement and verbal behavior
__label__1 in some cases  the person will exhibit catatonic behaviors  which show decreased reactivity to the environment  such as posturing  in which the person maintains a rigid and bizarre posture for long periods of time  or catatonic stupor  a complete lack of movement and verbal behavior
__label__0 interest in the role of dopamine in schizophrenia was stimulated by two sets of findings  drugs that increase dopamine levels can produce schizophrenia  like symptoms  and medications that block dopamine activity reduce the symptoms  howes  kapur
__label__1 the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that an overabundance of dopamine or too many dopamine receptors are responsible for the onset and maintenance of schizophrenia  snyder
__label__0 more recent work in this area suggests that abnormalities in dopamine vary by brain region and thus contribute to symptoms in unique ways
__label__0 early detection and treatment of conditions such as heart disease and cancer have improved survival rates and quality of life for people who suffer from these conditions
__label__0 a new approach involves identifying people who show minor symptoms of psychosis  such as unusual thought content  paranoia  odd communication  delusions  problems at school or work  and a decline in social functioning  which are coined prodromal symptoms  and following these individuals over time to determine which of them develop a psychotic disorder and which factors best predict such a disorder
__label__0 a number of factors have been identified that predict a greater likelihood that prodromal individuals will develop a psychotic disorder  genetic risk  a family history of psychosis   recent deterioration in functioning  high levels of unusual thought content  high levels of suspicion or paranoia  poor social functioning  and a history of substance abuse  fusar  poli et al
__label__1 the term personality refers loosely to one s stable  consistent  and distinctive way of thinking about  feeling  acting  and relating to the world
__label__1 people with personality disorders exhibit a personality style that differs markedly from the expectations of their culture  is pervasive and inflexible  begins in adolescence or early adulthood  and causes distress or impairment  apa
__label__0 generally  individuals with these disorders exhibit enduring personality styles that are extremely troubling and often create problems for them and those with whom they come into contact
__label__0 people with these disorders usually are impulsive  overly dramatic  highly emotional  and erratic
__label__1 cluster c disorders include avoidant personality disorder  dependent personality disorder  and obsessive  compulsive personality disorder  which is not the same thing as obsessive  compulsive disorder
__label__0 people with these disorders often appear to be nervous and fearful
__label__1 mood disorders   link   are characterized by severe disturbances in mood and emotions  most often depression  but also mania and elation  rothschild
__label__0 all of us experience fluctuations in our moods and emotional states  and often these fluctuations are caused by events in our lives
__label__0 these subtypes  what the dsm refer to as specifiers  are not specific disorders  rather  they are labels used to indicate specific patterns of symptoms or to specify certain periods of time in which the symptoms may be present
__label__1 one subtype  seasonal pattern  applies to situations in which a person experiences the symptoms of major depressive disorder only during a particular time of year  eg  fall or winter
__label__0 in everyday language  people often refer to this subtype as the winter blues
__label__1 a person with bipolar disorder  commonly known as manic depression  often experiences mood states that vacillate between depression and mania  that is  the person s mood is said to alternate from one emotional extreme to the other  in contrast to unipolar  which indicates a persistently sad mood
__label__0 if so  what might such predispositions be
__label__0 a study by caspi and others    suggests that an alteration in a specific gene that regulates serotonin  the httlpr gene  might be one culprit
__label__0 these investigators found that people who experienced several stressful life events were significantly more likely to experience episodes of major depression if they carried one or two short versions of this gene than if they carried two long versions
__label__0 this theory  which focuses on rumination in the development of depression  was first described in the late s to explain the higher rates of depression in women than in men  nolen  hoeksema
__label__1 rumination is the repetitive and passive focus on the fact that one is depressed and dwelling on depressed symptoms  rather that distracting one s self from the symptoms or attempting to address them in an active  problem  solving manner  nolen  hoeksema
__label__0 when people ruminate  they have thoughts such as  why am i so unmotivated
__label__0 obsessive  compulsive and related disorders are a group of overlapping disorders that generally involve intrusive  unpleasant thoughts and repetitive behaviors
__label__0 many of us experience unwanted thoughts from time to time  eg  craving double cheeseburgers when dieting   and many of us engage in repetitive behaviors on occasion  eg  pacing when nervous
__label__1 compulsions are repetitive and ritualistic acts that are typically carried out primarily as a means to minimize the distress that obsessions trigger or to reduce the likelihood of a feared event  apa
__label__0 compulsions often include such behaviors as repeated and extensive hand washing  cleaning  checking  eg  that a door is locked   and ordering  eg  lining up all the pencils in a particular way   and they also include such mental acts as counting  praying  or reciting something to oneself   link
__label__0 compulsions characteristic of ocd are not performed out of pleasure  nor are they connected in a realistic way to the source of the distress or feared event
__label__1 a brain region that is believed to play a critical role in ocd is the orbitofrontal cortex  kopell  greenberg     an area of the frontal lobe involved in learning and decision  making  rushworth  noonan  boorman  walton   behrens      link
__label__0 in people with ocd  the orbitofrontal cortex becomes especially hyperactive when they are provoked with tasks in which  for example  they are asked to look at a photo of a toilet or of pictures hanging crookedly on a wall  simon  kaufmann  msch  kischkel   kathmann
__label__0 specific phobiaphobia is a greek word that means fear
__label__1 a person diagnosed with a specific phobia  formerly known as simple phobia  experiences excessive  distressing  and persistent fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation  such as animals  enclosed spaces  elevators  or flying   apa
__label__0 even though people realize their level of fear and anxiety in relation to the phobic stimulus is irrational  some people with a specific phobia may go to great lengths to avoid the phobic stimulus  the object or situation that triggers the fear and anxiety
__label__0 the second pathway of phobia acquisition is through vicarious learning  such as modeling
__label__0 for example  a child who observes his cousin react fearfully to spiders may later express the same fears  even though spiders have never presented any danger to him
__label__1 people with panic disorder experience recurrent  more than one  and unexpected panic attacks  along with at least one month of persistent concern about additional panic attacks  worry over the consequences of the attacks  or self  defeating changes in behavior related to the attacks  eg  avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations   apa
__label__0 as is the case with other anxiety disorders  the panic attacks can not result from the physiological effects of drugs and other substances  a medical condition  or another mental disorder
__label__1 conditioning theories of panic disorder propose that panic attacks are classical conditioning responses to subtle bodily sensations resembling those normally occurring when one is anxious or frightened  bouton  mineka   barlow
__label__0 for example  consider a child who has asthma
__label__1 for centuries  psychological disorders were viewed from a supernatural perspective  attributed to a force beyond scientific understanding
__label__0 those afflicted were thought to be practitioners of black magic or possessed by spirits   link    maher  maher
__label__0 the diathesis  stress model  zuckerman    integrates biological and psychosocial factors to predict the likelihood of a disorder
__label__1 this diathesis  stress model suggests that people with an underlying predisposition for a disorder  ie  a diathesis  are more likely than others to develop a disorder when faced with adverse environmental or psychological events  ie  stress   such as childhood maltreatment  negative life events  trauma  and so on
__label__0 such feelings would be normal
__label__0 if you felt extremely depressed  so much so that you lost interest in activities  had difficulty eating or sleeping  felt utterly worthless  and contemplated suicide  your feelings would be atypical  would deviate from the norm  and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder
__label__0 just because something is atypical  however  does not necessarily mean it is disordered
__label__0 many of the features of the harmful dysfunction model are incorporated in a formal definition of psychological disorder developed by the american psychiatric association  apa
__label__0 according to the apa     a psychological disorder is a condition that is said to consist of the following
__label__1 the dsm also provides information about comorbidity  the co  occurrence of two disorders
__label__0 for example  the dsm mentions that   of people with obsessive  compulsive disorder  ocd  also meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder   link
__label__0 psychologists hans and sybil eysenck were personality theorists   link   who focused on temperament  the inborn  genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter
__label__0 they believed personality is largely governed by biology
__label__0 the culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality  triandis  suh
__label__1 the term culture refers to all of the beliefs  customs  art  and traditions of a particular society
__label__0 culture is transmitted to people through language as well as through the modeling of culturally acceptable and nonacceptable behaviors that are either rewarded or punished  triandis  suh
__label__0 another method for assessment of personality is projective testing
__label__1 this kind of test relies on one of the defense mechanisms proposed by freud  projection  as a way to assess unconscious processes
__label__0 a third projective test is the rotter incomplete sentence blank  risb  developed by julian rotter in   recall his theory of locus of control  covered earlier in this chapter
__label__0 many newspapers now maintain both a print and an internet presence in order to compete for readers
__label__0 the rise of free news blogs  such as the huffington post  have made it difficult for newspapers to force readers to purchase online subscriptions to access material they place behind a digital paywall
__label__0 some local newspapers  in an effort to stay visible and profitable  have turned to social media  like facebook and twitter
__label__0 people wanted to know what was happening  and they wanted to know immediately
__label__0 although initially reluctant to be on the air  reporter edward r murrow of cbs began reporting live about germany s actions from his posts in europe
__label__0 his reporting contained news and some commentary  and even live coverage during germany s aerial bombing of london
__label__0 the first television advertisements  run by presidential candidates dwight d eisenhower and adlai stevenson in the early s  were mainly radio jingles with animation or short question  and  answer sessions
__label__0 in   john f kennedy s campaign used a hollywood  style approach to promote his image as young and vibrant
__label__0 the kennedy campaign ran interesting and engaging ads  featuring kennedy  his wife jacqueline  and everyday citizens who supported him
__label__0 following the terrorist attacks in new york and washington on september     president george w bush s bullhorn speech from the rubble of ground zero in new york similarly became a rally
__label__0 bush spoke to the workers and first responders and encouraged them  but his short speech became a viral clip demonstrating the resilience of new yorkers and the anger of a nation
__label__0 ian christopher mccaleb   bush tours ground zero in lower manhattan   cnn   september

__label__0 this test goes back to the new york times v sullivan    case  in which a police commissioner in alabama sued over inaccurate statements in a newspaper advertisement  new york times co v sullivan   us
__label__0 because the commissioner was a public figure  the us supreme court applied a stringent test of malice to determine whether the advertisement was libel  the court deemed it was not
__label__1 in   the supreme court heard the pentagon papers case  in which the us government sued the new york times and the washington post to stop the release of information from a classified study of the vietnam war
__label__0 the supreme court ruled that while the government can impose prior restraint on the media  meaning the government can prevent the publication of information  that right is very limited
__label__0 the court gave the newspapers the right to publish much of the study  but revelation of troop movements and the names of undercover operatives are some of the few approved reasons for which the government can stop publication or reporting
__label__1 the communications act of  replaced the radio act and created a more powerful entity to monitor the airwaves  a seven  member federal communications commission  fcc  to oversee both radio and telephone communication
__label__0 the fcc  which now has only five members   link    requires radio stations to apply for licenses  granted only if stations follow rules about limiting advertising  providing a public forum for discussion  and serving local and minority communities

__label__0 why do we have two parties
__label__0 the two  party system came into being because the structure of us elections  with one seat tied to a geographic district  tends to lead to dominance by two major political parties
__label__0 even when there are other options on the ballot  most voters understand that minor parties have no real chance of winning even a single office
__label__1 plurality voting  commonly referred to as first  past  the  post  is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins  whether or not he or she gains a majority   percent or greater  of the total votes cast
__label__0 for instance  abraham lincoln won the presidency in  even though he clearly lacked majority support given the number of candidates in the race
__label__0 in   four candidates competed for the presidency  lincoln  a republican  two democrats  one from the northern wing of the party and one from the southern wing  and a member of the newly formed constitutional union party  a southern party that wished to prevent the nation from dividing over the issue of slavery
__label__0 abandoning plurality voting  even if the winner  take  all election were kept  would almost certainly increase the number of parties from which voters could choose
__label__1 the easiest switch would be to a majoritarian voting scheme  in which a candidate wins only if he or she enjoys the support of a majority of voters
__label__0 if no candidate wins a majority in the first round of voting  a run  off election is held among the top contenders
__label__0 scholars of voting behavior have also suggested at least three other characteristics of the us system that are likely to influence party outcomes  the electoral college  demobilized ethnicity  and campaign and election laws
__label__0 first  the united states has a presidential system in which the winner is selected not directly by the popular vote but indirectly by a group of electors known collectively as the electoral college
__label__0 one of the best  known party realignments occurred when democrats moved to include african americans and other minorities into their national coalition during the great depression
__label__0 after the civil war  republicans  the party of lincoln  were viewed as the party that had freed the slaves
__label__0 roosevelt won the election with almost  percent of the popular vote and  electoral college votes  compared to incumbent herbert hoover s
__label__1 the  election is considered an example of a critical election  one that represents a sudden  clear  and long  term shift in voter allegiances
__label__0 after this election  the political parties were largely identified as being divided by differences in their members  socio  economic status
__label__0 they are part of what is known as the party organization
__label__1 the party organization is the formal structure of the political party  and its active members are responsible for coordinating party behavior and supporting party candidates
__label__0 it is a vital component of any successful party because it bears most of the responsibility for building and maintaining the party  brand   it also plays a key role in helping select  and elect  candidates for public office
__label__0 first  many americans  especially young people  are more interested in the topics discussed at the national level than at the state or local level
__label__0 according to john green of the ray c bliss institute of applied politics   local elections tend to be about things like sewers  and roads and police protection  which are not as dramatic an issue as same  sex marriage or global warming or international affairs
__label__0 elizabeth lehman   trend shows generation focuses mostly on social  national issues   httpwwwthenewsoutletorgsurveylocalmillennialsmoreinterestedinbigissues  march
__label__0 presidential elections and the behavior of the us congress are also far more likely to make the news broadcasts than the activities of county commissioners  and the national  level party organization is mostly responsible for coordinating the activities of participants at this level
__label__0 the national party is a fundraising army for presidential candidates and also serves a key role in trying to coordinate and direct the efforts of the house and senate
__label__1 one of the first challenges facing the party  in  government  or the party identifiers who have been elected or appointed to hold public office  is to achieve their policy goals
__label__1 the means to do this is chosen in meetings of the two major parties  republican meetings are called party conferences and democrat meetings are called party caucuses
__label__0 key benefits like committee appointments  leadership positions  and money for important projects in their home district may hinge on legislators following the lead of the party
__label__1 these pressures are particularly acute for the majority party  so named because it controls more than half the seats in one of the two chambers
__label__0 the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader  the majority party s congressional leaders  have significant tools at their disposal to punish party members who defect on a particular vote
__label__1 for the first few decades of the current pattern of divided government  the threat it posed to the government appears to have been muted by a high degree of bipartisanship  or cooperation through compromise
__label__0 many pieces of legislation were passed in the s and s with reasonably high levels of support from both parties
__label__0 movements on the left have also arisen
__label__0 the occupy wall street movement was born of the government s response to the great recession of  and its assistance to endangered financial institutions  provided through the troubled asset relief program  tarp   link
__label__0 the occupy movement believed the recession was caused by a failure of the government to properly regulate the banking industry
__label__0 several conflicting theories have been offered
__label__0 the first and perhaps best argument is that polarization is a party  in  government phenomenon driven by a decades  long sorting of the voting public  or a change in party allegiance in response to shifts in party position
__label__0 morris fiorina   americans have not become more politically polarized   the washington post   june
__label__0 according to the sorting thesis  before the s  voters were mostly concerned with state  level party positions rather than national party concerns
__label__0 since parties are bottom  up institutions  this meant local issues dominated elections  it also meant national  level politicians typically paid more attention to local problems than to national party politics
__label__1 before then  it was common for many states to practice redistricting  or redrawing of their electoral maps  only if they gained or lost seats in the us house of representatives
__label__0 this can happen once every ten years as a result of a constitutionally mandated reapportionment process  in which the number of house seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes
__label__0 according to political scientist nolan mccarty  there is little evidence to support the redistricting hypothesis alone
__label__0 first  he argues  the senate has become polarized just as the house of representatives has  but people vote for senators on a statewide basis
__label__1 in federalist no   written in the late eighteenth century  james madison noted that the formation of self  interested groups  which he called factions  was inevitable in any society  as individuals started to work together to protect themselves from the government
__label__0 interest groups and political parties are two of the most easily identified forms of factions in the united states
__label__0 encyclopedia of american political parties and elections
__label__0 new york  checkmark books
__label__0 anti  federalists preferred a more confederate system built on state equality and autonomy
__label__0 saul cornell
__label__0 however  members of each faction quickly realized that they had a vested interest not only in nominating and electing a president who shared their views  but also in winning other elections
__label__0 two loosely affiliated party coalitions  known as the federalists and the democratic  republicans  soon emerged
__label__0 the federalists succeeded in electing their first leader  john adams  to the presidency in   only to see the democratic  republicans gain victory under thomas jefferson four years later in
__label__0 andrew jackson won more popular votes and more votes in the electoral college than any other candidate
__label__0 however  because he did not win the majority  more than half  of the available electoral votes  the election was decided by the house of representatives  as required by the twelfth amendment
__label__0 the twelfth amendment limited the house s choice to the three candidates with the greatest number of electoral votes
__label__0 new york  oxford university press
__label__0 many of these positions were given to party bosses and their friends
__label__1 these men were the leaders of political machines  organizations that secured votes for the party s candidates or supported the party in other ways
__label__0 perhaps more importantly  this election  focused organization also sought to maintain power by creating a broader coalition and thereby expanding the range of issues upon which the party was constructed
__label__0 sean wilentz
__label__0 roosevelt attempted to form a third party  known as the progressive party  as an alternative to the more business  minded republicans
__label__1 the progressives sought to correct the many problems that had arisen as the united states transformed itself from a rural  agricultural nation into an increasingly urbanized  industrialized country dominated by big business interests
__label__0 on april   or  tax day      members of the tea party movement rallied at the minnesota state capitol in st paul in favor of smaller government and against the affordable care act  left
__label__0 two years later  supporters of the law  right  demonstrated in front of the us supreme court during oral arguments in national federation of independent business v sebelius  in which the court eventually upheld most provisions of the law

__label__1 formally  a lobbyist is someone who represents the interest organization before government  is usually compensated for doing so  and is required to register with the government in which he or she lobbies  whether state or federal
__label__0 the lobbyist s primary goal is usually to influence policy
__label__0 interest groups in the states   in politics in the american states
__label__0 washington  dc  cq press
__label__1 first  interest groups may take the form of membership organizations  which individuals join voluntarily and to which they usually pay dues
__label__0 membership groups often consist of people who have common issues or concerns  or who want to be with others who share their views
__label__0 interest groups also include associations  which are typically groups of institutions that join with others  often within the same trade or industry  trade associations   and have similar concerns
__label__0 the american beverage associationhttpwwwameribevorg  march      includes coca  cola  red bull north america  rockstar  and kraft foods
__label__0 while influencing policy is the primary goal  interest groups also monitor government activity  serve as a means of political participation for members  and provide information to the public and to lawmakers
__label__0 according to the national conference of state legislatures  by november   thirty  six states had laws requiring that voters provide identification at the polls
__label__0 httpwwwncslorgresearchelectionsandcampaignsvoteridaspx  november
__label__0 a civil rights group like the national association for the advancement of colored people  naacp  will keep track of proposed voter  identification bills in state legislatures that might have an effect on voting rights
__label__0 this organization will contact lawmakers to voice approval or disapproval of proposed legislation  inside lobbying  and encourage group members to take action by either donating money to it or contacting lawmakers about the proposed bill  outside lobbying
__label__0 on the other hand  public interest groups attempt to promote public  or collective  goods
__label__1 such collective goods are benefits  tangible or intangible  that help most or all citizens
__label__0 these goods are often produced collectively  and because they may not be profitable and everyone may not agree on what public goods are best for society  they are often underfunded and thus will be underproduced unless there is government involvement
__label__0 group leaders also play an important role in overcoming collective action problems
__label__0 for instance  political scientist robert salisbury suggests that group leaders will offer incentives to induce activity among individuals
__label__0 robert salisbury   an exchange theory of interest groups   midwest journal of political science          peter b clark and james q wilson   incentive systems  a theory of organizations   administration science quarterly
__label__1 some offer material incentives  which are tangible benefits of joining a group
__label__0 aarp  for example  offers discounts on hotel accommodations and insurance rates for its members  while dues are very low  so they can actually save money by joining
__label__0 rather than being a single disturbance  debate about immigration policy has ebbed and flowed in recent years  creating what might best be described as a series of minor disturbances
__label__0 when  during his presidential candidacy  donald trump made controversial statements about immigrants  many rallied both for and against him
__label__0 jenna johnson   immigration continues to be donald trump s rallying issue   washington post   october   httpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewspostpoliticswpimmigrationcontinuestobedonaldtrumpsrallyingissueprotestors take to the streets on different sides of the immigration issue
__label__0 some argue that the united states is a nation of immigrants  whereas others demonstrate in support of greater restrictions on immigration
__label__0 joining interest groups can help facilitate civic engagement  which allows people to feel more connected to the political and social community
__label__1 some interest groups develop as grassroots movements  which often begin from the bottom up among a small number of people at the local level
__label__0 interest groups can amplify the voices of such individuals through proper organization and allow them to participate in ways that would be less effective or even impossible alone or in small numbers
__label__0 on the other hand  stem cell research is highly salient to members of the american neurological association  an interest organization that represents academic neurologists and neuroscientists
__label__0 accordingly  different interests represent the more specialized needs of different specialties within the medical community  but fragmentation can occur when a large interest like this has diverging needs
__label__0 such was also the case when several unions split from the afl  cio  american federation of labor  congress of industrial organizations   the nation s largest federation of unions  in
__label__0 thomas and hrebenar   interest groups in the states           thomas and hrebenar   nationalization of interest groups and lobbying in the states
__label__0 improved technology and the development of social media have made it easier for smaller groups to form and to attract and communicate with members
__label__0 however  not all scholars accept the premise that mobilization is natural and that all groups have the potential for access to decision  makers
__label__1 the elite critique suggests that certain interests  typically businesses and the wealthy  are advantaged and that policies more often reflect their wishes than anyone else s
__label__0 political scientist e e schattschneider noted that  the flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upperclass accent
__label__0 e e schattschneider
__label__0 while most scholars agree that some interests do have advantages  others have questioned the overwhelming dominance of certain interests
__label__0 additionally  neopluralist scholars argue that certainly some interests are in a privileged position  but these interests do not always get what they want
__label__0 virginia gray and david lowery
__label__0 
__label__1 in buckley v valeo     the supreme court upheld congress s right to regulate elections by restricting contributions to campaigns and candidates
__label__0 however  at the same time  it overturned restrictions on expenditures by candidates and their families  as well as total expenditures by campaigns
__label__0 buckley v valeo       us
__label__1 in   an exemption was granted to get  out  the vote and grassroots voter registration drives  creating what has become known as the soft  money loophole  soft money was a way in which interests could spend money on behalf of candidates without being restricted by federal law
__label__0 some continued to argue that campaign expenditures are a form of speech  a position with which two recent supreme court decisions are consistent
__label__0 the citizens united v federal election commission
__label__0 citizens united v federal election commission       us
__label__0 and the mccutcheon v federal election commission
__label__0 mccutcheon v federal election commission       us
__label__0 cases opened the door for a substantially greater flow of money into elections
__label__1 citizens united overturned the soft money ban of the bipartisan campaign reform act and allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections
__label__0 while the supreme court has paved the way for increased spending in politics  lobbying is still regulated in many ways
__label__0 adam j newmark   measuring state legislative lobbying regulation       state politics and policy quarterly          nownes and newmark   interest groups in the states
__label__0 the  lobbying disclosure act defined who can and can not lobby  and requires lobbyists and interest groups to register with the federal government
__label__0 nownes  interest groups in american politics
__label__0 the honest leadership and open government act of  further increased restrictions on lobbying
__label__0 for example  the act prohibited contact between members of congress and lobbyists who were the spouses of other congress members
__label__1 states deep in debt were printing increasingly worthless paper currency  many were mired in interstate trade battles with each other  and in western massachusetts  a small group of revolutionary war veterans angry over the prospect of losing their farms broke into armed open revolt against the state  in what came to be known as shays  rebellion
__label__0 the conclusion many reached was that the articles of confederation were simply not strong enough to keep the young republic together
__label__0 in the spring of   a convention was called  and delegates from all the states  except rhode island  which boycotted the convention  were sent to philadelphia to hammer out a solution to this central problem
__label__0 the storm of debate over how to allocate power between large and small states was eventually calmed by a third proposal
__label__1 the connecticut compromise  also called the great compromise  proposed a bicameral congress with members apportioned differently in each house
__label__0 the upper house  the senate  was to have two members from each state
__label__1 congressional apportionment today is achieved through the equal proportions method  which uses a mathematical formula to allocate seats based on us census bureau population data  gathered every ten years as required by the constitution
__label__0 at the close of the first us congress in   there were sixty  five representatives  each representing approximately thirty thousand citizens
__label__0 while the strangely drawn districts succeeded in their stated goals  nearly quintupling the number of african american representatives in congress in just over two decades  they have frustrated others who claim they are merely a new form of an old practice  gerrymandering
__label__1 gerrymandering is the manipulation of legislative district boundaries as a way of favoring a particular candidate
__label__1 an implied power is one not specifically detailed in the constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government
__label__1 and an inherent power  while not enumerated or implied  must be assumed to exist as a direct result of the country s existence
__label__0 in this section  we will learn about each type of power and the foundations of legitimacy they claim
__label__0 but in united states v lopez  a decision issued in   the court changed course again and  for the first time in half a century  struck down a law as an unconstitutional overstepping of the commerce clause
__label__0 united states v lopez   us
__label__0 five years later  the court did it again  convincing many that the country may be witnessing the beginning of a rollback in congress s power to regulate in the states
__label__0 when the patient protection and affordable care act  also known as the aca  or obamacare  came before the supreme court in   many believed the court would strike it down
__label__0 but presidents have sought to increase their power almost from the beginning  typically at the expense of the congress
__label__0 by the nature of the enumerated powers provided to the president  it is during wartime that the chief executive is most powerful and congress least powerful
__label__0 for example  president abraham lincoln  who oversaw the prosecution of the civil war  stretched the bounds of his legal authority in a number of ways  such as by issuing the emancipation proclamation that freed slaves in the confederate states
__label__0 abraham lincoln  impact and legacy   httpmillercenterorgpresident  biography  lincoln  impact  and  legacy  may
__label__0 following the twin scandals of vietnam and watergate in the early s  congress attempted to assert itself as a coequal branch  even in creating foreign policy  but could not hold back the trend
__label__0 the war powers resolution  covered in the foreign policy chapter  was intended to strengthen congressional war powers but ended up clarifying presidential authority in the first sixty days of a military conflict
__label__0 the war on terrorism after  has also strengthened the president s hand
__label__0 another important reform occurred in   when senators john mccain  r  az  and russell feingold  d  wi  drafted  and congress passed  the bipartisan campaign reform act  bcra   also referred to as the mccain  feingold act
__label__1 the purpose of this law was to limit the use of  soft money   which is raised for purposes like party  building efforts  get  out  the  vote efforts  and issue  advocacy ads
__label__0 in the wake of the citizens united decision  a new type of advocacy group emerged  the super pac
__label__1 a traditional pac is an organization designed to raise hard money to elect or defeat candidates
__label__0 such pacs tended to be run by businesses and other groups  like the teamsters union and the national rifle association  to support their special interests
__label__0 despite the power of the conferences  however  the most important leadership position in the house is actually elected by the entire body of representatives
__label__0 this position is called the speaker of the house and is the only house officer mentioned in the constitution
__label__0 the constitution does not require the speaker to be a member of the house  although to date  all fifty  four speakers have been
__label__0 however  the majority rules the day in the house  like a cartel
__label__0 on the majority side  because it holds the speakership  the majority leader also has considerable power
__label__0 historically  moreover  the majority leader tends to be in the best position to assume the speakership when the current speaker steps down
__label__0 there are well over two hundred committees  subcommittees  select committees  and joint committees in the congress
__label__1 the core committees are called standing committees
__label__0 there are twenty standing committees in the house and sixteen in the senate   link
__label__0 in   republican chuck grassley of iowa  a   the chair of the senate judiciary committee  refused to hold hearings on the nomination of merrick garland to the supreme court  despite the urging of his committee colleagues
__label__0 in the meantime  garland met with numerous senators  such as republican susan collins of maine  b
__label__0 once hearings have been completed  the bill enters the markup stage
__label__1 this is essentially an amending and voting process
__label__0 to invoke cloture  the senate had to get a two  thirds majority
__label__0 this was difficult to do  but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the senate floor  with the salient exception of senator strom thurmond s record twenty  four  hour filibuster of the civil rights act  in   after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era  the senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two  thirds to three  fifths  or sixty votes  where it remains today  except for judicial nominations for which only fifty  five votes are needed to invoke cloture
__label__0 moreover  filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act  the reconciliation act of  was the act under which the implementing legislation for obamacare was passed
__label__0 in a defining moment for the filibuster  senator strom thurmond of south carolina spoke for twenty  four hours and eighteen minutes against a weak civil rights bill in
__label__0 a vocal proponent of segregation and white supremacy  thurmond had made no secret of his views and had earlier run for the presidency on a segregationist platform
__label__1 some interests groups form political action committees  pacs   groups that collect funds from donors and distribute them to candidates who support their issues
__label__0 as  link  makes apparent  many large corporations like honeywell international  att  and lockheed martin form pacs to distribute money to candidates
__label__0 httpswwwopensecretsorgpacs  march
__label__0 other pacs are either politically or ideologically oriented
__label__0 for example  a proposed tax increase may result in the formation or mobilization of anti  tax groups that will lobby the legislature and try to encourage the public to oppose the proposed legislation
__label__0 prior to the election in   political activist grover norquist  the founder of americans for tax reform  atr   asked all republican members of congress to sign a  taxpayer protection pledge  that they would fight efforts to raise taxes or to eliminate any deductions that were not accompanied by tax cuts
__label__0 ninety  five percent of the republicans in congress signed the pledge

__label__0 some interests arise solely to defeat legislation and go dormant after they achieve their immediate objectives
__label__0 they are not permitted the liberty of employing their own reason and judgment while acting as representatives in congress
__label__0 this is the delegate model of representation
__label__1 instead  proper representation for some is rooted in the racial  ethnic  socioeconomic  gender  and sexual identity of the representatives themselves
__label__0 this form of representation is called descriptive representation
__label__1 the nwpc was formed by bella abzug   link    gloria steinem  shirley chisholm  and other leading feminists to encourage women s participation in political parties  elect women to office  and raise money for their campaigns
__label__0 for example  patsy mink  d  hi    link    the first asian american woman elected to congress  was the coauthor of the education amendments act of   title ix of which prohibits sex discrimination in education
__label__0 mink had been interested in fighting discrimination in education since her youth  when she opposed racial segregation in campus housing while a student at the university of nebraska
__label__0 and as representatives of their constituents  they are charged with addressing those constituents  interests
__label__0 historically  this job has included what some have affectionately called  bringing home the bacon  but what many  usually those outside the district in question  call pork  barrel politics
__label__1 as a term and a practice  pork  barrel politics  federal spending on projects designed to benefit a particular district or set of constituents  has been around since the nineteenth century  when barrels of salt pork were both a sign of wealth and a system of reward
__label__0 indeed  when the ratings are graphed  the two noticeable peaks are at  percent in  and  percent in    link
__label__0 in   according to gallup polling  the rise in approval accompanied a similar rise in other mood measures  including president bill clinton s approval ratings and general satisfaction with the state of the country and the economy
__label__0 in   approval spiked after the september  terrorist attacks and the bush administration launched the

__label__0 articles of confederation  article xi
__label__0 the presidency was proposed early in the constitutional convention in philadelphia by virginia s edmund randolph  as part of james madison s proposal for a federal government  which became known as the virginia plan
__label__0 madison offered a rather sketchy outline of the executive branch  leaving open whether what he termed the  national executive  would be an individual or a set of people
__label__0 he proposed that congress select the executive  whose powers and authority  and even length of term of service  were left largely undefined
__label__0 by early september  the electoral college had emerged as the way to select a president for four years who was eligible for reelection
__label__0 this process is discussed more fully in the chapter on elections
__label__0 this should have meant that texas s  electoral votes could have gone to only one or the other
__label__0 cheney anticipated this problem and had earlier registered to vote in wyoming  where he was originally from and where he had served as a representative years earlier
__label__0 alan clendenning   court  cheney is wyoming resident   abc news   december   httpabcnewsgocompoliticsstoryidpage  may
__label__0 it s hard to imagine that the  presidential election could have been even more complicated than it was  but thanks to that seemingly innocuous rule in article ii of the constitution  that was a real possibility
__label__0 an important means of ensuring that no president could become tyrannical was to build into the constitution a clear process for removing the chief executive  impeachment
__label__1 impeachment is the act of charging a government official with serious wrongdoing  the constitution calls this wrongdoing high crimes and misdemeanors
__label__0 the most recent impeachment was of president bill clinton  brought on by his lying about an extramarital affair with a white house intern named monica lewinsky
__label__0 house republicans felt the affair and clinton s initial public denial of it rose to a level of wrongdoing worthy of impeachment
__label__0 later presidents built on the foundation of these powers
__label__0 some waged undeclared wars  as john adams did against the french in the quasi  war
__label__0 others agreed to negotiate for significant territorial gains  as thomas jefferson did when he oversaw the purchase of louisiana from france
__label__1 james monroe used his annual message in  to declare that the united states would consider it an intolerable act of aggression for european powers to intervene in the affairs of the nations of the western hemisphere
__label__0 later dubbed the monroe doctrine  this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of american power in the twentieth century
__label__0 andrew jackson employed the veto as a measure of policy to block legislative initiatives with which he did not agree and acted unilaterally when it came to depositing federal funds in several local banks around the country instead of in the bank of the united states
__label__0 he then responded to the newly heightened state of affairs by sending us troops to the rio grande  the border texan expansionists claimed for texas
__label__0 mexico sent troops in response  and the mexican  american war began soon afterward
__label__0 fred greenstein
__label__0 
__label__0 in suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus  lincoln blurred the boundaries between acceptable dissent and unacceptable disloyalty
__label__0 he also famously used a unilateral proclamation to issue the emancipation proclamation  which cited the military necessity of declaring millions of slaves in confederate  controlled territory to be free
__label__0 his successor  andrew johnson  became so embroiled with radical republicans about ways to implement reconstruction policies and programs after the civil war that the house of representatives impeached him  although the legislators in the senate were unable to successfully remove him from office

__label__0 as the federal bureaucracy expanded  so too did the president s power to grow agencies like the secret service and the federal bureau of investigation
__label__1 presidents also further developed the concept of executive privilege  the right to withhold information from congress  the judiciary  or the public
__label__0 this right  not enumerated in the constitution  was first asserted by george washington to curtail inquiry into the actions of the executive branch  mark j rozel
__label__0 reformers proposed the solution of putting the executive branch in charge of developing a budget that could be scrutinized  amended  and approved by congress
__label__0 however  president woodrow wilson  owing to a provision tacked onto the bill regarding presidential appointments  vetoed the legislation that would have transformed the budgeting process in this way
__label__0 his successor  warren harding  felt differently and signed the budget and accounting act of
__label__0 following the first election of washington  the political party system gained steam and power in the electoral process  creating separate nomination and general election stages
__label__0 early on  the power to nominate presidents for office bubbled up from the party operatives in the various state legislatures and toward what was known as the king caucus or congressional caucus
__label__1 the caucus or large  scale gathering was made up of legislators in the congress who met informally to decide on nominees from their respective parties
__label__1 the caucus or large  scale gathering was made up of legislators in the congress who met informally to decide on nominees from their respective parties
__label__0 the rise of the primary system during the progressive era came at the cost of party regulars  control of the process of candidate selection
__label__0 some party primaries even allow registered independents or members of the opposite party to vote
__label__0 when washington declined to run again after two terms  matters worsened
__label__0 in   political rivals john adams and thomas jefferson were elected president and vice president  respectively
__label__0 yet the two men failed to work well together during adams s administration  much of which jefferson spent at his virginia residence at monticello
__label__0 following the  presidential election  when then  governor george w bush won by a single electoral vote and with over half a million fewer individual votes than his challenger  astonished voters called for electoral college reform
__label__0 years later  however  nothing of any significance had been done
__label__0 
__label__0 the president hoped that by nominating a former senator from the opposition he could ensure the confirmation process would go smoothly
__label__0 instead  however  senator ted cruz used the confirmation hearing to question the vietnam war hero s patriotism
__label__0 hagel was eventually confirmed by a    vote
__label__0 when supreme court justice antonin scalia died unexpectedly in early   many in washington braced for a political sandstorm of obstruction and accusations
__label__0 such was the record of supreme court nominations during the obama administration and  indeed  for the last few decades
__label__0 but presidents have typically used this loophole to get around a senate that s inclined to obstruct
__label__0 presidents bill clinton and george w bush made  and  recess appointments  respectively
__label__0 president obama has made far fewer recess appointments  as of may     he had made only thirty  two

__label__0 one reason this number is so low is another loophole the senate began using at the end of george w bush s presidency  the pro forma session
__label__0 vice presidents were often sent on minor missions or used as mouthpieces for the administration  often with a sharp edge
__label__0 richard nixon s vice president spiro agnew is an example
__label__0 but in the s  starting with jimmy carter  presidents made a far more conscious effort to make their vice presidents part of the governing team  placing them in charge of increasingly important issues
__label__0 in the case of george w bush and his very experienced vice president dick cheney  observers speculated whether the vice president might have exercised too much influence
__label__0 barack obama s choice for a running mate and subsequent two  term vice president  former senator joseph biden  was picked for his experience  especially in foreign policy
__label__0 president obama relied on vice president biden for advice throughout his tenure
__label__0 with the popularization of radio in the early twentieth century  it became possible to broadcast the president s voice into many of the nation s homes
__label__0 his work strongly influenced the subsequent avant  garde and modernist movements in literature and art  especially in understanding the role of the observer  artist  or writer in shaping the society they attempted to observe
__label__1 john dewey built on the idea of pragmatism to create a theory of instrumentalism  which advocated the use of education in the search for truth
__label__0 dewey believed that education  specifically observation and change through the scientific method  was the best tool by which to reform and improve american society as it continued to grow ever more complex
__label__0 instead  the republican party nominated a three  time governor from ohio  rutherford b hayes
__label__1 hayes was a popular candidate who advocated for both  hard money   an economy based upon gold currency transactions  to protect against inflationary pressures and civil service reform  that is  recruitment based upon merit and qualifications  which was to replace the practice of handing out government jobs as  spoils
__label__0 most importantly  he had no significant political scandals in his past  unlike his predecessor grant  who suffered through the crdit mobilier of america scandal
__label__0 in this most notorious example of gilded age corruption  several congressmen accepted cash and stock bribes in return for appropriating inflated federal funds for the construction of the transcontinental railroad
__label__0 long supporting former president grant  conkling had no sympathy for some of hayes  early appeals for civil service reform
__label__0 the other was james g blaine  republican senator from maine and leader of the half  breeds
__label__1 the half  breeds  who received their derogatory nickname from stalwart supporters who considered blaine s group to be only  half  republican   advocated for some measure of civil service reform
__label__0 one of the first efforts to organize farmers came in  with oliver hudson kelly s creation of the patrons of husbandry  more popularly known as the grange
__label__0 in the wake of the civil war  the grangers quickly grew to over  million members in less than a decade   link
__label__0 in   the alliance formed the populist party  or people s party  as it was more widely known
__label__0 beginning with nonpresidential  year elections  the populist party had modest success  particularly in kansas  nebraska  and the dakotas  where they succeeded in electing several state legislators  one governor  and a handful of congressmen
__label__0 a group of journalists and writers collectively known as muckrakers provided an important spark that ignited the progressive movement
__label__1 unlike the  yellow journalists  who were interested only in sensationalized articles designed to sell newspapers  muckrakers exposed problems in american society and urged the public to identify solutions
__label__0 this shift  they believed  would ultimately lead to a system of government that was better able to address the needs of its citizens
__label__0 grassroots progressives pushed forward their agenda of direct democracy through the passage of three state  level reforms
__label__0 at the state level  perhaps the greatest advocate of progressive government was robert la follette   link
__label__1 during his time as governor  from  through   la follette introduced the wisconsin idea  wherein he hired experts to research and advise him in drafting legislation to improve conditions in his state
__label__0 fighting bob  supported numerous progressive ideas while governor  he signed into law the first workman s compensation system  approved a minimum wage law  developed a progressive tax law  adopted the direct election of us senators before the subsequent constitutional amendment made it mandatory  and advocated for women s suffrage
__label__0 although debs established a tenuous relationship with samuel gompers and the american federation of labor  some within the socialist party favored a more radical political stance than debs s craft union structure
__label__0 as a result  william  big bill  haywood formed the more radical iww  or wobblies  in
__label__0 although he remained an active member of the socialist party until   haywood appreciated the outcry of the more radical arm of the party that desired an industrial union approach to labor organization
__label__0 in a speech delivered at the cotton states and international exposition in atlanta in   which was meant to promote the economy of a  new south   washington proposed what came to be known as the atlanta compromise   link
__label__0 speaking to a racially mixed audience  washington called upon african americans to work diligently for their own uplift and prosperity rather than preoccupy themselves with political and civil rights
__label__0 roosevelt won his second term in  with an overwhelming  percent of the popular vote
__label__0 after the election  he moved quickly to enact his own brand of progressivism  which he called a square deal for the american people
__label__1 early in his second term  roosevelt read muckraker upton sinclair s  novel and expos on the meatpacking industry  the jungle
__label__0 in their campaigns  roosevelt and wilson formulated competing progressive platforms
__label__1 wilson described his more moderate approach as one of new freedom  which stood for a smaller federal government to protect public interests from the evils associated with big businesses and banks
__label__1 roosevelt campaigned on the promise of new nationalism  a charge that he said required a vigorous and powerful federal government to protect public interests
__label__0 lottie remained in china through famines  the boxer rebellion  and other hardships
__label__1 she fought against foot binding  a cultural tradition where girls  feet were tightly bound to keep them from growing  and shared her personal food and money when those around her were suffering
__label__0 the difference in this uprising  however  was that supporters saw in the renewed us navy a force that could be a strong ally for cuba
__label__1 additionally  the late s saw the height of yellow journalism  in which newspapers such as the new york journal  led by william randolph hearst  and the new york world  published by joseph pulitzer  competed for readership with sensationalistic stories
__label__0 these publishers  and many others who printed news stories for maximum drama and effect  knew that war would provide sensational copy
__label__0 in   russia obtained permission to build a railroad across northeastern manchuria
__label__0 one by one  each country carved out their own sphere of influence  where they could control markets through tariffs and transportation  and thus ensure their share of the chinese market
__label__0 roosevelt articulated this seeming double standard in a  address before congress  in a speech that became known as the roosevelt corollary
__label__1 the roosevelt corollary was based on the original monroe doctrine of the early nineteenth century  which warned european nations of the consequences of their interference in the caribbean
__label__0 despite the loss of american lives on the lusitania  president wilson stuck to his path of neutrality in europe s escalating war  in part out of moral principle  in part as a matter of practical necessity  and in part for political reasons
__label__0 few americans wished to participate in the devastating battles that ravaged europe  and wilson did not want to risk losing his reelection by ordering an unpopular military intervention
__label__0 the wilson administration created the committee of public information under director george creel  a former journalist  just days after the united states declared war on germany
__label__0 creel employed artists  speakers  writers  and filmmakers to develop a propaganda machine
__label__0 some troops saw combat  however  and were commended for serving with valor
__label__1 the th infantry  for example  known as the harlem hellfighters  served on the frontline of france for six months  longer than any other american unit
__label__0 one hundred seventy  one men from that regiment received the legion of merit for meritorious service in combat
__label__1 referring to what became known as the fourteen points  wilson called for openness in all matters of diplomacy and trade  specifically  free trade  freedom of the seas  an end to secret treaties and negotiations  promotion of self  determination of all nations  and more
__label__1 in addition  he called for the creation of a league of nations to promote the new world order and preserve territorial integrity through open discussions in place of intimidation and war
__label__0 while illness  economic hardship  and racial tensions all came from within  another destabilizing factor arrived from overseas
__label__1 as revolutionary rhetoric emanating from bolshevik russia intensified in  and   a red scare erupted in the united states over fear that communist infiltrators sought to overthrow the american government as part of an international revolution   link
__label__0 when investigators uncovered a collection of thirty  six letter bombs at a new york city post office  with recipients that included several federal  state  and local public officials  as well as industrial leaders such as john d rockefeller  fears grew significantly
__label__0 the assembly line helped ford reduce labor costs within the production process by moving the product from one team of workers to the next  each of them completing a step so simple they had to be  in ford s words   no smarter than an ox    link
__label__0 ford s reliance on the moving assembly line  scientific management  and time  motion studies added to his emphasis on efficiency over craftsmanship
__label__0 but they also participated in more expressly klan activities like burning crosses and the public denunciation of catholics and jews   link
__label__0 by   this second ku klux klan had six million members in the south  west  and  particularly  the midwest  more americans than there were in the nation s labor unions at the time
__label__0 while the organization publicly abstained from violence  its member continued to employ intimidation  violence  and terrorism against its victims  particularly in the south
__label__0 rebellious american youth  in particular  adjusted to the changes by embracing a new morality that was far more permissive than the social mores of their parents
__label__1 many young women of the era shed their mother s morality and adopted the dress and mannerisms of a flapper  the jazz age female stereotype  seeking the endless party
__label__0 flappers wore shorter skirts  shorter hair  and more makeup  and they drank and smoked with the boys   link
__label__1 world war i  fundamentalism  and the red scare  a pervasive american fear of communist infiltrators prompted by the success of the bolshevik revolution  all left their mark on these intellectuals
__label__0 known as the lost generation  writers like f scott fitzgerald  ernest hemingway  sinclair lewis  edith wharton  and john dos passos expressed their hopelessness and despair by skewering the middle class in their work
__label__0 they felt alienated from society  so they tried to escape  some literally  to criticize it
__label__0 from  to   secretary of the interior albert b
__label__0 fall was involved in a scam that became known as the teapot dome scandal
__label__1 fall had leased navy reserves in teapot dome  wyoming  and two other sites in california to private oil companies without opening the bidding to other companies
__label__0 several banks  including deposit institutions that originally avoided investment loans  began to offer easy credit  allowing people to invest  even when they lacked the money to do so
__label__1 an example of this mindset was the florida land boom of the s  real estate developers touted florida as a tropical paradise and investors went all in  buying land they had never seen with money they did nt have and selling it for even higher prices
__label__0 this increase took place in spite of the twenty  six states that passed a variety of laws to prohibit the employment of married women
__label__1 several women found employment in the emerging pink collar occupations  viewed as traditional women s work  including jobs as telephone operators  social workers  and secretaries
__label__0 others took jobs as maids and housecleaners  working for those fortunate few who had maintained their wealth
__label__0 among their demands  the association sought a federal government plan to set agricultural prices artificially high enough to cover the farmers  costs  as well as a government commitment to sell any farm surpluses on the world market
__label__1 to achieve their goals  the group called for farm holidays  during which farmers would neither sell their produce nor purchase any other goods until the government met their demands
__label__0 however  the greatest strength of the association came from the unexpected and seldom  planned actions of its members  which included barricading roads into markets  attacking nonmember farmers  and destroying their produce
__label__0 dust storms roiled through the great plains  creating huge  choking clouds that piled up in doorways and filtered into homes through closed windows
__label__0 even more quickly than it had boomed  the land of agricultural opportunity went bust  due to widespread overproduction and overuse of the land  as well as to the harsh weather conditions that followed  resulting in the creation of the dust bowl   link
__label__0 the dust storms that blew through the great plains were epic in scale
__label__0 drifts of dirt piled up against doors and windows
__label__1 additionally  he outlined with secretary of state henry stimson the hoover  stimson doctrine  which announced that the united states would never recognize claims to territories seized by force  a direct response to the recent japanese invasion of manchuria
__label__0 other diplomatic overtures met with less success for hoover
__label__0 most notably  in an effort to support the american economy during the early stages of the depression  the president signed into law the smoot  hawley tariff in
__label__1 the law  which raised tariffs on thousands of imports  was intended to increase sales of american  made goods  but predictably angered foreign trade partners who in turn raised their tariffs on american imports  thus shrinking international trade and closing additional markets to desperate american manufacturers
__label__0 roosevelt understood the need to  save the patient   to borrow a medical phrase he often employed  as well as to  cure the ill
__label__1 this meant both creating jobs  through such programs as the works progress administration  which provided employment to over eight million americans   link    as well as reconfiguring the structure of the american economy
__label__0 in pursuit of these two goals  americans re  elected roosevelt for three additional terms in the white house and became full partners in the reshaping of their country
__label__0 any ideas that roosevelt held almost did not come to fruition  thanks to a would  be assassin s bullet
__label__0 on february     after delivering a speech from his open car in miami s bayfront park  local italian bricklayer giuseppe zangara emerged from a crowd of well  wishers to fire six shots from his revolver
__label__0 although roosevelt emerged from the assassination attempt unscathed  zangara wounded five individuals that day  including chicago mayor tony cermak  who attended the speech in the hopes of resolving any long  standing differences with the president  elect
__label__0 in june   roosevelt replaced the emergency banking act with the more permanent glass  steagall banking act
__label__1 this law prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking  therefore stopping the practice of banks speculating in the stock market with deposits
__label__0 large farms often cut production by laying off sharecroppers or evicting tenant farmers  making the program even worse for them than for small farm owners
__label__1 their frustration led to the creation of the southern tenant farmers union  stfu   an interracial organization that sought to gain government relief for these most disenfranchised of farmers
__label__0 the stfu organized  protested  and won its members some wage increases through the mid s  but the overall plight of these workers remained dismal
__label__0 employing several thousand americans on a project that roosevelt envisioned as a template for future regional redevelopment  the tva revitalized a river valley that landowners had badly over  farmed  leaving behind eroded soil that lacked essential nutrients for future farming
__label__0 under the direction of david lilienthal  beginning in   the tva workers erected a series of dams to harness the tennessee river in the creation of much  needed hydroelectric power
__label__0 the arrival of both electric lighting and machinery to the region eased the lives of the people who lived there  as well as encouraged industrial growth
__label__0 in   congress also passed the emergency relief appropriation act  which authorized the single largest expenditure at that time in the country s history    billion
__label__0 almost one  third of those funds were invested in a new relief agency  the works progress administration  wpa
__label__0 harry hopkins  formerly head of the cwa  took on the wpa and ran it until
__label__0 believing it to be his moment of strongest public support  roosevelt chose to exact a measure of revenge against the us supreme court for challenging his programs and to pressure them against challenging his more recent second new deal provisions
__label__0 to this end  roosevelt created the informally named  supreme court packing plan  and tried to pack the court in his favor by expanding the number of justices and adding new ones who supported his views
__label__0 his plan was to add one justice for every current justice over the age of seventy who refused to step down
__label__1 in addition  the four power treaty  signed by the united states  great britain  france  and japan in   committed the signatories to eschewing any territorial expansion in asia
__label__1 in   the united states and fourteen other nations signed the kellogg  briand pact  declaring war an international crime
__label__0 despite hopes that such agreements would lead to a more peaceful world  far more nations signed on to the agreement in later years  they failed because none of them committed any of the nations to take action in the event of treaty violations
__label__0 responding to the german invasion of poland  roosevelt worked with congress to alter the neutrality laws to permit a policy of  cash and carry  in munitions for britain and france
__label__1 the legislation  passed and signed by roosevelt in november   permitted belligerents to purchase war materiel if they could pay cash for it and arrange for its transportation on board their own ships
__label__0 millions of americans purchased more than   billion worth of war bonds

__label__0 forced by racial discrimination to live in the barrios of east los angeles  many mexican american youths sought to create their own identity and began to adopt a distinctive style of dress known as zoot suits  which were also popular among many young african american men
__label__0 the zoot suits  which required large amounts of cloth to produce  violated wartime regulations that restricted the amount of cloth that could be used in civilian garments
__label__0 in   although roosevelt had yet to meet soviet premier joseph stalin  he had confidence that he could forge a positive relationship with him  a confidence that churchill believed was born of naivet
__label__0 these allied leaders  known as the big three  thrown together by the necessity to defeat common enemies  took steps towards working in concert despite their differences
__label__1 albert einstein  who had emigrated to the united states in  to escape the nazis  urged president roosevelt to launch an american atomic research project  and roosevelt agreed to do so  with reservations
__label__0 in late   the program received its code name  the manhattan project
__label__0 located at los alamos  new mexico  the manhattan project ultimately employed  people and cost some   billion
__label__1 one of these was the alliance for progress  which collaborated with the governments of latin american countries to promote economic growth and social stability in nations whose populations might find themselves drawn to communism
__label__1 kennedy also established the agency for international development to oversee the distribution of foreign aid  and he founded the peace corps  which recruited idealistic young people to undertake humanitarian projects in asia  africa  and latin america
__label__0 he hoped that by augmenting the food supply and improving healthcare and education  the us government could encourage developing nations to align themselves with the united states and reject soviet or chinese overtures
__label__0 on october   kennedy demanded that soviet premier nikita khrushchev remove the missiles
__label__0 he also ordered a naval quarantine placed around cuba to prevent soviet ships from approaching
__label__0 despite his use of the word  quarantine  instead of  blockade   for a blockade was considered an act of war  a potential war with the soviet union was nevertheless on the president s mind
__label__0 on november     a few days after taking the oath of office  president johnson addressed a joint session of congress and vowed to accomplish the goals that john f kennedy had set and to expand the role of the federal government in securing economic opportunity and civil rights for all
__label__0 johnson brought to his presidency a vision of a great society in which everyone could share in the opportunities for a better life that the united states offered  and in which the words  liberty and justice for all  would have real meaning

__label__0 wartime price controls were retained for some items but removed from others  like meat
__label__0 in his  inaugural address  truman referred to his programs as the  fair deal   a nod to his predecessor s new deal
__label__0 he wanted the fair deal to include americans of color and became the first president to address the national association for the advancement of colored people  naacp
__label__1 he advised that the best way to thwart soviet plans for the world was to contain soviet influence  primarily through economic policy  to those places where it already existed and prevent its political expansion into new areas
__label__0 this strategy  which came to be known as the policy of containment  formed the basis for us foreign policy and military decision making for more than thirty years
__label__0 the british aided the authoritarian government of greece in its battles against greek communists
__label__0 in march   great britain announced that it could no longer afford the cost of supporting government military activities and withdrew from participation in the greek civil war
__label__1 stepping into this power vacuum  the united states announced the truman doctrine  which offered support to greece and turkey in the form of financial assistance  weaponry  and troops to help train their militaries and bolster their governments against communism
__label__0 he strove to balance the federal budget  which appealed to conservative republicans  but retained much of the new deal and even expanded social security
__label__1 he maintained high levels of defense spending but  in his farewell speech in   warned about the growth of the military  industrial complex  the matrix of relationships between officials in the department of defense and executives in the defense industry who all benefited from increases in defense spending
__label__0 he disliked the tactics of joseph mccarthy but did not oppose him directly  preferring to remain above the fray

__label__0 some school districts voluntarily integrated their schools
__label__0 for many other districts  however   deliberate speed  was very  very slow
__label__0 the political divisions that plagued the united states in the s were reflected in the rise of identity politics in the s
__label__1 as people lost hope of reuniting as a society with common interests and goals  many focused on issues of significance to the subgroups to which they belonged  based on culture  ethnicity  sexual orientation  gender  and religion
__label__0 the ultimate political goal of the national organization for women  now  was the passage of an equal rights amendment  era

__label__0 the soviet union significantly aided its allies  egypt and syria  and the united states supported israel  earning the enmity of arab nations
__label__0 just as influential as antiwar protests and campus violence in turning people against the war was the publication of documents the media dubbed the pentagon papers in june
__label__1 these were excerpts from a study prepared during the johnson administration that revealed the true nature of the conflict in vietnam
__label__0 nixon  however  refused to hand the tapes over and cited executive privilege  the right of the president to refuse certain subpoenas
__label__0 when he offered to supply summaries of the conversations  cox refused
__label__1 reagan s primary goal upon taking office was to stimulate the sagging economy while simultaneously cutting both government programs and taxes

__label__0 young children put objects in their mouths to see if the items are edible  and once they can grasp objects  they may shake or bang them to see if they make sounds
__label__1 between  and  months old  the child develops object permanence  which is the understanding that even if something is out of sight  it still exists  bogartz  shinskey   schilling
__label__0 according to piaget  young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight
__label__1 during this stage  we also expect children to display egocentrism  which means that the child is not able to take the perspective of others

__label__0 to better understand  imagine this scenario  greg returns home from work  and upon opening the front door his wife happily greets him and inquires about his day
__label__0 you might say you were very tired or feeling unwell and needed quiet time  a situational explanation
__label__1 the actor  observer bias is the phenomenon of attributing other people s behavior to internal factors  fundamental attribution error  while attributing our own behavior to situational forces  jones  nisbett    nisbett  caputo  legant   marecek    choi  nisbett

__label__0 as actors of behavior  we have more information available to explain our own behavior
__label__0 a common ideology  or worldview  in the united states is the just  world hypothesis
__label__1 the just  world hypothesis is the belief that people get the outcomes they deserve  lerner  miller
__label__0 in order to maintain the belief that the world is a fair place  people tend to think that good people experience positive outcomes  and bad people experience negative outcomes  jost  banaji   nosek    jost  major
__label__1 conception occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote   link
__label__1 a zygote begins as a one  cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg merge
__label__0 the genetic makeup and sex of the baby are set at this point
__label__0 now blood vessels grow  forming the placenta
__label__1 the placenta is a structure connected to the uterus that provides nourishment and oxygen from the mother to the developing embryo via the umbilical cord
__label__0 basic structures of the embryo start to develop into areas that will become the head  chest  and abdomen
__label__1 each organ of the fetus develops during a specific period in the pregnancy  called the critical or sensitive period   link
__label__0 for example  research with primate models of fasd has demonstrated that the time during which a developing fetus is exposed to alcohol can dramatically affect the appearance of facial characteristics associated with fetal alcohol syndrome
__label__1 motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects
__label__1 fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers  toes  and eyes  and enable coordination of small actions  eg  grasping a toy  writing with a pencil  and using a spoon
__label__1 gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and legs and involve larger movements  eg  balancing  running  and jumping
__label__0 he used the concept of secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and child
__label__1 a secure base is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as he explores his surroundings
__label__0 bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment  the caregiver must be responsive to the child s physical  social  and emotional needs  and the caregiver and child must engage in mutually enjoyable interactions  bowlby      link
__label__1 in cases of resistant attachment  children tend to show clingy behavior  but then they reject the attachment figure s attempts to interact with them  ainsworth  bell
__label__0 these children do not explore the toys in the room  as they are too fearful
__label__1 in authoritarian style  the parent places high value on conformity and obedience
__label__0 the parents are often strict  tightly monitor their children  and express little warmth
__label__0 as you can see  parenting styles influence childhood adjustment  but could a child s temperament likewise influence parenting
__label__1 temperament refers to innate traits that influence how one thinks  behaves  and reacts with the environment
__label__0 children with easy temperaments demonstrate positive emotions  adapt well to change  and are capable of regulating their emotions
__label__0 also during this time  primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature
__label__1 primary sexual characteristics are organs specifically needed for reproduction  like the uterus and ovaries in females and testes in males
__label__1 secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs  such as development of breasts and hips in girls  and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys
__label__1 cognitive empathy  also known as theory  of  mind  which we discussed earlier with regard to egocentrism   relates to the ability to take the perspective of others and feel concern for others  shamay  tsoory  tomer   aharon  peretz
__label__0 cognitive empathy begins to increase in adolescence and is an important component of social problem solving and conflict avoidance
__label__0 in contrast  until about  years ago in the united states  a doctor might not inform someone that they were dying  and the majority of deaths occurred in hospitals
__label__0 in  that reality began to change with cicely saunders  who created the first modern hospice in england
__label__1 the aim of hospice is to help provide a death with dignity and pain management in a humane and comfortable environment  which is usually outside of a hospital setting

__label__0 often  our behavior  attitudes  and beliefs are affected when we experience a threat to our self  esteem or positive self  image
__label__1 psychologist leon festinger    defined cognitive dissonance as psychological discomfort arising from holding two or more inconsistent attitudes  behaviors  or cognitions  thoughts  beliefs  or opinions
__label__1 festinger s theory of cognitive dissonance states that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors  attitudes  or beliefs that runs counter to our positive self  perceptions  we experience psychological discomfort  dissonance
__label__1 festinger s theory of cognitive dissonance states that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors  attitudes  or beliefs that runs counter to our positive self  perceptions  we experience psychological discomfort  dissonance
__label__0 besides the classic military example and group initiation  can you think of other examples of cognitive dissonance
__label__0 here is one  marco and maria live in fairfield county  connecticut  which is one of the wealthiest areas in the united states and has a very high cost of living
__label__0 after the war  hovland continued his exploration of persuasion at yale university
__label__0 out of this work came a model called the yale attitude change approach  which describes the conditions under which people tend to change their attitudes
__label__0 hovland demonstrated that certain features of the source of a persuasive message  the content of the message  and the characteristics of the audience will influence the persuasiveness of a message  hovland  janis   kelley
__label__1 the peripheral route is an indirect route that uses peripheral cues to associate positivity with the message  petty  cacioppo
__label__0 instead of focusing on the facts and a product s quality  the peripheral route relies on association with positive characteristics such as positive emotions and celebrity endorsement
__label__0 the remaining members of the group were confederates of the researcher
__label__1 a confederate is a person who is aware of the experiment and works for the researcher
__label__0 confederates are used to manipulate social situations as part of the research design  and the true  nave participants believe that confederates are  like them  uninformed participants in the experiment
__label__0 the finding that conformity is more likely to occur when responses are public than when they are private is the reason government elections require voting in secret  so we are not coerced by others   link
__label__0 the asch effect can be easily seen in children when they have to publicly vote for something
__label__0 for example  if the teacher asks whether the children would rather have extra recess  no homework  or candy  once a few children vote  the rest will comply and go with the majority
__label__0 another form of social influence is obedience to authority
__label__1 obedience is the change of an individual s behavior to comply with a demand by an authority figure
__label__0 people often comply with the request because they are concerned about a consequence if they do not comply
__label__0 another phenomenon of group conformity is groupthink
__label__1 groupthink is the modification of the opinions of members of a group to align with what they believe is the group consensus  janis
__label__0 in group situations  the group often takes action that individuals would not perform outside the group setting because groups make more extreme decisions than individuals do
__label__0 social loafing
__label__0 another way in which a group presence can affect our performance is social loafing
__label__1 social loafing is the exertion of less effort by a person working together with a group
__label__0 social loafing occurs when our individual performance can not be evaluated separately from the group
__label__0 as a consequence of its concern for candidate characteristics  industrial psychology must also consider issues of legality regarding discrimination in hiring
__label__1 organizational psychology is a discipline interested in how the relationships among employees affect those employees and the performance of a business
__label__0 this includes studying worker satisfaction  motivation  and commitment
__label__0 the involvement of the united states in world war i in april  catalyzed the participation in the military effort of psychologists working in this area
__label__0 at that time yerkes was the president of the year  old american psychological association  apa
__label__1 the apa is a professional association in the united states for clinical and research psychologists
__label__0 gilbreth was another influential i  o psychologist who strove to find ways to increase productivity   link
__label__0 using time and motion studies  gilbreth and her husband  frank  worked to make workers more efficient by reducing the number of motions required to perform a task
__label__0 how did your prejudice develop
__label__1 prejudice often begins in the form of a stereotype  that is  a specific belief or assumption about individuals based solely on their membership in a group  regardless of their individual characteristics
__label__1 prejudice often begins in the form of a stereotype  that is  a specific belief or assumption about individuals based solely on their membership in a group  regardless of their individual characteristics
__label__0 stereotypes become overgeneralized and applied to all members of a group
__label__1 sexism is prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based on their sex
__label__0 typically  sexism takes the form of men holding biases against women  but either sex can show sexism toward their own or their opposite sex
__label__1 another form of prejudice is homophobia  prejudice and discrimination of individuals based solely on their sexual orientation
__label__0 like ageism  homophobia is a widespread prejudice in us society that is tolerated by many people  herek  mclemore    nosek
__label__0 negative feelings often result in discrimination  such as the exclusion of lesbian  gay  bisexual  and transgender  lgbt  people from social groups and the avoidance of lgbt neighbors and co  workers
__label__0 when we hold a stereotype about a person  we have expectations that he or she will fulfill that stereotype
__label__1 a self  fulfilling prophecy is an expectation held by a person that alters his or her behavior in a way that tends to make it true
__label__0 when we hold stereotypes about a person  we tend to treat the person according to our expectations
__label__1 an in  group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to
__label__1 a group that we do nt belong to  or an out  group  is a group that we view as fundamentally different from us
__label__0 for example  if you are female  your gender in  group includes all females  and your gender out  group includes all males   link
__label__0 humans engage in aggression when they seek to cause harm or pain to another person
__label__1 aggression takes two forms depending on one s motives  hostile or instrumental
__label__0 for example  women may express their aggression covertly  for example  by communication that impairs the social standing of another person
__label__0 another theory that explains one of the functions of human aggression is frustration aggression theory  dollard  doob  miller  mowrer   sears
__label__1 this theory states that when humans are prevented from achieving an important goal  they become frustrated and aggressive
__label__0 with the rapid growth of technology  and widely available mobile technology and social networking media  a new form of bullying has emerged  cyberbullying  hoff  mitchell
__label__1 cyberbullying  like bullying  is repeated behavior that is intended to cause psychological or emotional harm to another person
__label__0 what is unique about cyberbullying is that it is typically covert  concealed  done in private  and the bully can remain anonymous
__label__0 social psychologists claim that diffusion of responsibility is the likely explanation
__label__1 diffusion of responsibility is the tendency for no one in a group to help because the responsibility to help is spread throughout the group  bandura
__label__0 because there were many witnesses to the attack on genovese  as evidenced by the number of lit apartment windows in the building  individuals assumed someone else must have already called the police
__label__0 some researchers suggest that altruism operates on empathy
__label__1 empathy is the capacity to understand another person s perspective  to feel what he or she feels
__label__0 an empathetic person makes an emotional connection with others and feels compelled to help  batson
__label__0 self  disclosure is part of the two way street
__label__1 self  disclosure is the sharing of personal information  laurenceau  barrett   pietromonaco
__label__0 we form more intimate connections with people with whom we disclose important information about ourselves
__label__1 empty love is having commitment without intimacy or passion
__label__1 companionate love  which is characteristic of close friendships and family relationships  consists of intimacy and commitment but no passion
__label__1 romantic love is defined by having passion and intimacy  but no commitment
__label__0 performance appraisals are typically documented several times a year  often with a formal process and an annual face  to  face brief meeting between an employee and his supervisor
__label__0 it is important that the original job analysis play a role in performance appraisal as well as any goals that have been set by the employee or by the employee and supervisor
__label__1 the americans with disabilities act  ada  of  states people may not be discriminated against due to the nature of their disability
__label__1 a disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities such as hearing  walking  and breathing
__label__0 some people love their jobs  some people tolerate their jobs  and some people can not stand their jobs
__label__1 job satisfaction describes the degree to which individuals enjoy their job
__label__0 it was described by edwin locke    as the state of feeling resulting from appraising one s job experiences
__label__1 many people juggle the demands of work life with the demands of their home life  whether it be caring for children or taking care of an elderly parent  this is known as work  family balance
__label__0 we might commonly think about work interfering with family  but it is also the case that family responsibilities may conflict with work obligations  carlson  kacmar   williams
__label__0 his theory lays out two different styles called theory x and theory y
__label__1 in the theory x approach to management  managers assume that most people dislike work and are not innately self  directed
__label__0 theory x managers perceive employees as people who prefer to be led and told which tasks to perform and when
__label__0 this is in contrast to the transformational leader
__label__1 people who have transformational leadership possess four attributes to varying degrees  they are charismatic  highly liked role models   inspirational  optimistic about goal attainment   intellectually stimulating  encourage critical thinking and problem solving   and considerate  bass  avolio   atwater
__label__0 many workplaces offer diversity training to help everyone involved bridge and understand cultural differences
__label__1 diversity training educates participants about cultural differences with the goal of improving teamwork
__label__0 there is always the potential for prejudice between members of two groups  but the evidence suggests that simply working together  particularly if the conditions of work are set carefully that such prejudice can be reduced or eliminated
__label__0 workplace violence is one aspect of workplace safety that i  o psychologists study
__label__1 workplace violence is any act or threat of physical violence  harassment  intimidation  or other threatening  disruptive behavior that occurs at the workplace
__label__0 it ranges from threats and verbal abuse to physical assaults and even homicide  occupational safety  health administration
__label__0 one of the methods used to reduce accidents in the workplace is a checklist
__label__0 the airline industry is one industry that uses checklists
__label__1 a useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well  being  lazarus  folkman
__label__0 a critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise  that is  judge  demanding or threatening events  often referred to as stressors   these appraisals  in turn  influence our reactions to such events
__label__1 the perception of a threat triggers a secondary appraisal  judgment of the options available to cope with a stressor  as well as perceptions of how effective such options will be  lyon      link
__label__1 as you may recall from what you learned about self  efficacy  an individual s belief in his ability to complete a task is important  bandura
__label__0 selye and the general adaptation syndromeanother important early contributor to the stress field was hans selye  mentioned earlier
__label__0 he would eventually become one of the world s foremost experts in the study of stress   link
__label__0 if exposure to a stressor is prolonged  the organism will enter the stage of resistance
__label__1 during this stage  the initial shock of alarm reaction has worn off and the body has adapted to the stressor
__label__0 the acth then activates the adrenal glands to secrete a number of hormones into the bloodstream  an important one is cortisol  which can affect virtually every organ within the body
__label__1 cortisol is commonly known as a stress hormone and helps provide that boost of energy when we first encounter a stressor  preparing us to run away or fight
__label__0 however  sustained elevated levels of cortisol weaken the immune system
__label__1 as our society becomes increasingly multiethnic and multiracial  mental health professionals must develop cultural competence   link    which means they must understand and address issues of race  culture  and ethnicity
__label__0 they must also develop strategies to effectively address the needs of various populations for which eurocentric therapies have limited application  sue
__label__0 in the s  psychiatrists thomas holmes and richard rahe wanted to examine the link between life stressors and physical illness  based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person s normal life routines are stressful  whether these events are desirable or undesirable
__label__1 they developed the social readjustment rating scale  srrs   consisting of  life events that require varying degrees of personal readjustment  holmes  rahe
__label__0 many life events that most people would consider pleasant  eg  holidays  retirement  marriage  are among those listed on the srrs  these are examples of eustress
__label__0 although the specific stressors for these occupations are diverse  they seem to share two common denominators  heavy workload and uncertainty about and lack of control over certain aspects of a job
__label__1 both of these factors contribute to job strain  a work situation that combines excessive job demands and workload with little discretion in decision making or job control  karasek  theorell
__label__0 clearly  many occupations other than the ones listed in  link  involve at least a moderate amount of job strain in that they often involve heavy workloads and little job control  eg  inability to decide when to take breaks
__label__0 frequently  a person who is addicted to drugs andor alcohol has an additional psychological disorder
__label__1 saying a person has comorbid disorders means the individual has two or more diagnoses
__label__0 this can often be a substance  related diagnosis and another psychiatric diagnosis  such as depression  bipolar disorder  or schizophrenia
__label__1 physical disorders or diseases whose symptoms are brought about or worsened by stress and emotional factors are called psychophysiological disorders
__label__0 the physical symptoms of psychophysiological disorders are real and they can be produced or exacerbated by psychological factors  hence the psycho and physiological in psychophysiological
__label__0 the question of whether stress and negative emotional states can influence immune function has captivated researchers for over three decades  and discoveries made over that time have dramatically changed the face of health psychology  kiecolt  glaser
__label__1 psychoneuroimmunology is the field that studies how psychological factors such as stress influence the immune system and immune functioning
__label__0 the term psychoneuroimmunology was first coined in   when it appeared as the title of a book that reviewed available evidence for associations between the brain  endocrine system  and immune system  zacharie
__label__1 the cardiovascular system is composed of the heart and blood circulation system
__label__1 for many years  disorders that involve the cardiovascular system  known as cardiovascular disorders  have been a major focal point in the study of psychophysiological disorders because of the cardiovascular system s centrality in the stress response  everly  lating
__label__0 heart disease is one such condition
__label__0 also  one investigation followed over  male medical students from  to  years
__label__0 at the beginning of the study  these men completed a questionnaire assessing how they react to pressure  some indicated that they respond with high levels of anger  whereas others indicated that they respond with less anger
__label__0 decades later  researchers found that those who earlier had indicated the highest levels of anger were over  times more likely than those who indicated less anger to have had a heart attack by age   and they were  times more likely to have experienced heart disease by the same age  chang  ford  meoni  wang   klag
__label__1 asthma is a chronic and serious disease in which the airways of the respiratory system become obstructed  leading to great difficulty expelling air from the lungs
__label__1 the airway obstruction is caused by inflammation of the airways  leading to thickening of the airway walls  and a tightening of the muscles around them  resulting in a narrowing of the airways   link    american lung association
__label__1 family therapy is a special form of group therapy  consisting of one or more families
__label__0 although there are many theoretical orientations in family therapy  one of the most predominant is the systems approach
__label__0 both types of treatment help people with psychological disorders  such as depression  anxiety  and schizophrenia
__label__1 psychotherapy is a psychological treatment that employs various methods to help someone overcome personal problems  or to attain personal growth
__label__0 in modern practice  it has evolved ino what is known as psychodynamic therapy  which will be discussed later
__label__0 in a psychoanalyst s office  you might see a patient lying on a couch speaking of dreams or childhood memories  and the therapist using various freudian methods such as free association and dream analysis   link
__label__1 in free association  the patient relaxes and then says whatever comes to mind at the moment
__label__0 however  freud felt that the ego would at times try to block  or repress  unacceptable urges or painful conflicts during free association
__label__0 today  freud s psychoanalytical perspective has been expanded upon by the developments of subsequent theories and methodologies  the psychodynamic perspective
__label__0 this approach to therapy remains centered on the role of people s internal drives and forces  but treatment is less intensive than freud s original model
__label__1 in psychoanalysis  therapists help their patients look into their past to uncover repressed feelings
__label__1 in behavior therapy  a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable behaviors  rather than digging deeply into one s unconscious
__label__0 therapists with this orientation believe that dysfunctional behaviors  like phobias and bedwetting  can be changed by teaching clients new  more constructive behaviors
__label__1 in exposure therapy  a therapist seeks to treat clients  fears or anxiety by presenting them with the object or situation that causes their problem  with the idea that they will eventually get used to it
__label__0 this can be done via reality  imagination  or virtual reality
__label__0 one popular operant conditioning intervention is called the token economy
__label__1 this involves a controlled setting where individuals are reinforced for desirable behaviors with tokens  such as a poker chip  that can be exchanged for items or privileges
__label__1 psychotherapy  cognitive  behavioral therapycognitive  behavioral therapists focus much more on present issues than on a patient s childhood or past  as in other forms of psychotherapy
__label__1 one of the first forms of cognitive  behavioral therapy was rational emotive therapy  ret   which was founded by albert ellis and grew out of his dislike of freudian psychoanalysis  daniel  nd
__label__0 behaviorists such as joseph wolpe also influenced ellis s therapeutic approach  national association of cognitive  behavioral therapists
__label__1 cognitive  behavioral therapy  cbt  helps clients examine how their thoughts affect their behavior
__label__0 psychologist carl rogers developed a therapeutic orientation known as rogerian  or client  centered therapy
__label__0 note the change from patients to clients
__label__0 while these are often used in combination with psychotherapy  they also are taken by individuals not in therapy
__label__0 this is known as biomedical therapy
__label__1 medications used to treat psychological disorders are called psychotropic medications and are prescribed by medical doctors  including psychiatrists
__label__0 when we experience events in our lives that we appraise as stressful  it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress
__label__1 coping refers to mental and behavioral efforts that we use to deal with problems relating to stress  including its presumed cause and the unpleasant feelings and emotions it produces
__label__0 as cogently described in his statement  our reaction to potential stressors depends to a large extent on how much control we feel we have over such things
__label__1 perceived control is our beliefs about our personal capacity to exert influence over and shape outcomes  and it has major implications for our health and happiness  infurna  gerstorf
__label__0 extensive research has demonstrated that perceptions of personal control are associated with a variety of favorable outcomes  such as better physical and mental health and greater psychological well  being  diehl  hay
__label__0 while having social support is quite beneficial  being the recipient of prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory behaviors is associated with a number of negative outcomes
__label__0 in their literature review  brondolo  brady  pencille  beatty  and contrada    describe how racial prejudice and discrimination serve as unique  significant stressors for those who are the targets of such attitudes and behavior
__label__0 being the target of racism is associated with increased rates of depression  lowered self  esteem  hypertension  and cardiovascular disease
__label__0 in the s  herbert benson  a cardiologist  developed a stress reduction method called the relaxation response technique  greenberg
__label__1 the relaxation response technique combines relaxation with transcendental meditation  and consists of four components  stein
__label__0 although the study of stress and how it affects us physically and psychologically is fascinating  it is  admittedly  somewhat of a grim topic
__label__0 psychology is also interested in the study of a more upbeat and encouraging approach to human affairs  the quest for happiness
__label__0 in   seligman  the same person who conducted the learned helplessness experiments mentioned earlier   who was then president of the american psychological association  urged psychologists to focus more on understanding how to build human strength and psychological well  being
__label__0 in deliberately setting out to create a new direction and new orientation for psychology  seligman helped establish a growing movement and field of research called positive psychology  compton
__label__0 in terms of our health  the expression   do nt worry  be happy  is helpful advice indeed
__label__1 there has also been much work suggesting that optimism  the general tendency to look on the bright side of things  is also a significant predictor of positive health outcomes
__label__0 in the late s  a french physician  philippe pinel  argued for more humane treatment of the mentally ill
__label__0 he suggested that they be unchained and talked to  and that s just what he did for patients at la salptrire in paris in    link
__label__0 if an individual is mandated to attend therapy  she is seeking services involuntarily
__label__1 involuntary treatment refers to therapy that is not the individual s choice
__label__0 other individuals might voluntarily seek treatment
__label__0 diego likely has attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder  adhd
__label__0 the symptoms of this disorder were first described by hans hoffman in the s
__label__0 despite the retraction  the reporting in popular media led to concerns about a possible link between vaccines and autism persisting
__label__0 a recent survey of parents  for example  found that roughly a third of respondents expressed such a concern  kennedy  lavail  nowak  basket   landry     and perhaps fearing that their children would develop autism  more than   of parents of young children refuse or delay vaccinations  dempsey et al
__label__0 some parents of children with autism mounted a campaign against scientists who refuted the vaccine  autism link
__label__0 the memory impairments are not caused by ordinary forgetting
__label__1 some individuals with dissociative amnesia will also experience dissociative fugue  from the word  to flee  in french   whereby they suddenly wander away from their home  experience confusion about their identity  and sometimes even adopt a new identity  cardea  gleaves
__label__0 to explore these questions  let s start by focusing on a specific disease  sickle  cell anemia  and how it might affect two infected sisters
__label__1 sickle  cell anemia is a genetic condition in which red blood cells  which are normally round  take on a crescent  like shape   link
__label__0 watch this interview with renowned evolutionary psychologist david buss for an explanation of how a psychologist approaches evolution and how this approach fits within the field of social science
__label__0 a single gene may have multiple possible variations  or alleles
__label__1 an allele is a specific version of a gene
__label__0 so  a given gene may code for the trait of hair color  and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has
__label__0 when a sperm and egg fuse  their  chromosomes pair up and create a zygote with  pairs of chromosomes
__label__0 most traits are controlled by multiple genes  but some traits are controlled by one gene
__label__0 a characteristic like cleft chin  for example  is influenced by a single gene from each parent
__label__1 in this example  we will call the gene for cleft chin  b   and the gene for smooth chin  b  cleft chin is a dominant trait  which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent  bb  or both parents  bb  will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele
__label__0 sickle  cell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes
__label__1 for example  phenylketonuria  pku  is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmful amino acids into harmless byproducts
__label__0 if someone with this condition goes untreated  he or she will experience significant deficits in cognitive function  seizures  and increased risk of various psychiatric disorders
__label__0 gene mutations provide one source of harmful genes
__label__1 a mutation is a sudden  permanent change in a gene
__label__0 while many mutations can be harmful or lethal  once in a while  a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who do not have the mutation
__label__1 in another approach to gene  environment interactions  the field of epigenetics looks beyond the genotype itself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways
__label__0 in other words  researchers study how the same genotype can lead to very different phenotypes
__label__0 genes affect more than our physical characteristics
__label__0 indeed  scientists have found genetic linkages to a number of behavioral characteristics  ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality  for examples  see mustanski et al     comings  gonzales  saucier  johnson   macmurray
__label__0 glial cells  which outnumber neurons ten to one  are traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons  both physically and metabolically
__label__1 glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built  help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication  provide insulation to neurons  transport nutrients and waste products  and mediate immune responses
__label__0 neurons  on the other hand  serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system
__label__0 like all cells  neurons consist of several different parts  each serving a specialized function   link
__label__0 a neuron s outer surface is made up of a semipermeable membrane
__label__1 this membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules without an electrical charge to pass through it  while stopping larger or highly charged molecules
__label__0 the neuron is a small information processor  and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons
__label__0 these signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon  which ends at multiple terminal buttons
__label__1 the terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters  the chemical messengers of the nervous system
__label__0 in healthy individuals  the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons  where synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synapse   link
__label__1 the synapse is a very small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs
__label__0 once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse  they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron
__label__0 the neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate  a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra and extracellular fluids being electrically different
__label__1 this difference in charge across the membrane  called the membrane potential  provides energy for the signal
__label__0 with this influx of positive ions  the internal charge of the cell becomes more positive
__label__1 if that charge reaches a certain level  called the threshold of excitation  the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins  many additional pores open  causing a massive influx of na ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane potential  the peak action potential
__label__0 at the peak of the spike  the sodium gates close and the potassium gates open
__label__0 because it is all or none  the action potential is recreated  or propagated  at its full strength at every point along the axon
__label__0 much like the lit fuse of a firecracker  it does not fade away as it travels down the axon
__label__1 agonists are chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site and  thus  strengthen its effects
__label__1 an antagonist  on the other hand  blocks or impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor
__label__0 agonist and antagonist drugs are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person s condition
__label__1 the autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be outside the realm of voluntary control
__label__0 it can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions   link
__label__1 his pupils dilate  his heart rate and blood pressure increase  his bladder relaxes  his liver releases glucose  and adrenaline surges into his bloodstream
__label__0 this constellation of physiological changes  known as the fight or flight response  allows the body access to energy reserves and heightened sensory capacity so that it might fight off a threat or run away to safety
__label__0 when the spinal cord is damaged in a particular segment  all lower segments are cut off from the brain  causing paralysis
__label__1 therefore  the lower on the spine damage is  the fewer functions an injured individual loses  the two hemispheresthe surface of the brain  known as the cerebral cortex  is very uneven  characterized by a distinctive pattern of folds or bumps  known as gyri  singular  gyrus   and grooves  known as sulci  singular  sulcus   shown in  link
__label__0 these gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers
__label__1 the two hemispheres are connected by a thick band of neural fibers known as the corpus callosum  consisting of about  million axons
__label__0 the corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres to communicate with each other and allows for information being processed on one side of the brain to be shared with the other side
__label__0 normally  we are not aware of the different roles that our two hemispheres play in day  to  day functions  but there are people who come to know the capabilities and functions of their two hemispheres quite well
__label__0 the frontal lobe is involved in reasoning  motor control  emotion  and language
__label__1 it contains the motor cortex  which is involved in planning and coordinating movement  the prefrontal cortex  which is responsible for higher  level cognitive functioning  and broca s area  which is essential for language production
__label__1 the brain s parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe  and is involved in processing information from the body s senses
__label__1 it contains the somatosensory cortex  which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body  such as touch  temperature  and pain
__label__1 the temporal lobe is located on the side of the head  temporal means  near the temples    and is associated with hearing  memory  emotion  and some aspects of language
__label__1 the auditory cortex  the main area responsible for processing auditory information  is located within the temporal lobe
__label__0 wernicke s area  important for speech comprehension  is also located here
__label__0 other areas of the forebrainother areas of the forebrain  located beneath the cerebral cortex  include the thalamus and the limbic system
__label__1 the thalamus is a sensory relay for the brain
__label__0 the limbic system is made up of a number of different structures  but three of the most important are the hippocampus  the amygdala  and the hypothalamus   link
__label__1 the hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory
__label__1 the amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories
__label__0 in   henry gustav molaison  h m  was a year  old man who experienced severe seizures
__label__0 in an attempt to control his seizures  h m underwent brain surgery to remove his hippocampus and amygdala
__label__0 the substantia nigra  latin for  black substance   and the ventral tegmental area  vta  are also located in the midbrain   link
__label__0 both regions contain cell bodies that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine  and both are critical for movement
__label__1 the medulla controls the automatic processes of the autonomic nervous system  such as breathing  blood pressure  and heart rate
__label__1 the word pons literally means  bridge   and as the name suggests  the pons serves to connect the brain and spinal cord
__label__0 it also is involved in regulating brain activity during sleep
__label__0 brain imagingyou have learned how brain injury can provide information about the functions of different parts of the brain
__label__0 increasingly  however  we are able to obtain that information using brain imaging techniques on individuals who have not suffered brain injury
__label__0 in this section  we take a more in  depth look at some of the techniques that are available for imaging the brain  including techniques that rely on radiation  magnetic fields  or electrical activity within the brain
__label__1 in magnetic resonance imaging  mri   a person is placed inside a machine that generates a strong magnetic field
__label__0 the magnetic field causes the hydrogen atoms in the body s cells to move
__label__1 the endocrine system consists of a series of glands that produce chemical substances known as hormones   link
__label__1 like neurotransmitters  hormones are chemical messengers that must bind to a receptor in order to send their signal
__label__1 the adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response  such as epinephrine  adrenaline  and norepinephrine  noradrenaline
__label__1 the pancreas is an internal organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels  insulin and glucagon
__label__0 any experiment involving the participation of human subjects is governed by extensive  strict guidelines designed to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm
__label__0 any research institution that receives federal support for research involving human participants must have access to an institutional review board  irb
__label__1 the irb is a committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution s administration  scientists  and community members   link
__label__0 for example  if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire  we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants  responses
__label__0 in cases where deception is involved  participants must receive a full debriefing upon conclusion of the study  complete  honest information about the purpose of the experiment  how the data collected will be used  the reasons why deception was necessary  and information about how to obtain additional information about the study
__label__0 whereas irbs review research proposals that involve human participants  animal experimental proposals are reviewed by an institutional animal care and use committee  iacuc
__label__1 an iacuc consists of institutional administrators  scientists  veterinarians  and community members
__label__0 the sign  positive or negative  of the correlation coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship   link
__label__1 a positive correlation means that the variables move in the same direction
__label__0 put another way  it means that as one variable increases so does the other  and conversely  when one variable decreases so does the other
__label__0 however  correlation is limited because establishing the existence of a relationship tells us little about cause and effect
__label__0 while variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other  it could also be that some other factor  a confounding variable  is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest
__label__0 in the ice cream  crime rate example mentioned earlier  temperature is a confounding variable that could account for the relationship between the two variables
__label__0 often we read or hear about them and simply accept the information as valid
__label__1 or  we have a hunch about how something works and then look for evidence to support that hunch  ignoring evidence that would tell us our hunch is false  this is known as confirmation bias
__label__0 other times  we find illusory correlations based on the information that comes most easily to mind  even if that information is severely limited
__label__0 the two groups are designed to be the same except for one difference  experimental manipulation
__label__1 the experimental group gets the experimental manipulation  that is  the treatment or variable being tested  in this case  violent tv images   and the control group does not
__label__0 since experimental manipulation is the only difference between the experimental and control groups  we can be sure that any differences between the two are due to experimental manipulation rather than chance
__label__0 by being blind to which child is in which group  we protect against those biases
__label__0 this situation is a single  blind study  meaning that one of the groups  participants  are unaware as to which group they are in  experiment or control group  while the researcher who developed the experiment knows which participants are in each group
__label__0 to achieve this  we must pay attention to two important variables  or things that can be changed  in any experimental study  the independent variable and the dependent variable
__label__1 an independent variable is manipulated or controlled by the experimenter
__label__0 in a well  designed experimental study  the independent variable is the only important difference between the experimental and control groups
__label__0 if possible  we should use a random sample  there are other types of samples  but for the purposes of this chapter  we will focus on random samples
__label__1 a random sample is a subset of a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected
__label__0 random samples are preferred because if the sample is large enough we can be reasonably sure that the participating individuals are representative of the larger population
__label__0 once data is collected from both the experimental and the control groups  a statistical analysis is conducted to find out if there are meaningful differences between the two groups
__label__0 a statistical analysis determines how likely any difference found is due to chance  and thus not meaningful
__label__0 reliability and validity are two important considerations that must be made with any type of data collection
__label__1 reliability refers to the ability to consistently produce a given result
__label__0 in the context of psychological research  this would mean that any instruments or tools used to collect data do so in consistent  reproducible ways
__label__0 if scientists ultimately want to explain all behavior  focusing attention on such a special group of people can make it difficult to generalize any observations to the larger population as a whole
__label__1 generalizing refers to the ability to apply the findings of a particular research project to larger segments of society
__label__0 again  case studies provide enormous amounts of information  but since the cases are so specific  the potential to apply what s learned to the average person may be very limited
__label__0 the greatest benefit of naturalistic observation is the validity  or accuracy  of information collected unobtrusively in a natural setting
__label__1 having individuals behave as they normally would in a given situation means that we have a higher degree of ecological validity  or realism  than we might achieve with other research approaches
__label__0 often  psychologists develop surveys as a means of gathering data
__label__1 surveys are lists of questions to be answered by research participants  and can be delivered as paper  and  pencil questionnaires  administered electronically  or conducted verbally   link
__label__0 generally  the survey itself can be completed in a short time  and the ease of administering a survey makes it easy to collect data from a large number of people
__label__1 when we test the same group of individuals repeatedly over an extended period of time  we are conducting longitudinal research
__label__1 longitudinal research is a research design in which data  gathering is administered repeatedly over an extended period of time
__label__0 for example  we may survey a group of individuals about their dietary habits at age   retest them a decade later at age   and then again at age
__label__0 in contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others  such as intuition and personal experience  the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim
__label__1 scientific knowledge is empirical  it is grounded in objective  tangible evidence that can be observed time and time again  regardless of who is observing  while behavior is observable  the mind is not
__label__0 if someone is crying  we can see behavior
__label__1 facts are observable realities  and opinions are personal judgments  conclusions  or attitudes that may or may not be accurate
__label__0 in the scientific community  facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research
__label__0 the process of scientific research
__label__0 scientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method
__label__1 basically  ideas  in the form of theories and hypotheses  are tested against the real world  in the form of empirical observations   and those empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world  and so on
__label__1 a hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct  and it is often worded as an if  then statement  eg  if i study all night  i will get a passing grade on the test
__label__0 the hypothesis is extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world
__label__1 psyche comes to represent the human soul s triumph over the misfortunes of life in the pursuit of true happiness  bulfinch     in fact  the greek word psyche means soul  and it is often represented as a butterfly
__label__0 the word psychology was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished  green
__label__0 in most areas of psychology  this means earning a phd in a relevant area of psychology
__label__1 literally  phd refers to a doctor of philosophy degree  but here  philosophy does not refer to the field of philosophy per se
__label__0 rather  philosophy in this context refers to many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and sciences  the requirements to earn a phd vary from country to country and even from school to school  but usually  individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation
__label__0 individuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral degree  which is known as a psyd
__label__0 a psyd is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among individuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology
__label__0 psyd programs generally place less emphasis on research  oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context  norcorss  castle
__label__0 evolutionary psychology  and specifically  the evolutionary psychology of humans  has enjoyed a resurgence in recent decades
__label__0 to be subject to evolution by natural selection  a behavior must have a significant genetic cause
__label__1 developmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan
__label__0 developmental psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation
__label__0 more recently  the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach
__label__0 rather than explaining how personality arises  research is focused on identifying personality traits  measuring these traits  and determining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any given situation
__label__1 personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior  and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals
__label__0 until then  you will be introduced to one of the most controversial psychological studies ever conducted
__label__0 stanley milgram was an american social psychologist who is most famous for research that he conducted on obedience
__label__0 after the holocaust  in   a nazi war criminal  adolf eichmann  who was accused of committing mass atrocities  was put on trial
__label__1 health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological  psychological  and sociocultural factors
__label__1 health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological  psychological  and sociocultural factors
__label__0 this particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model   link
__label__0 health psychologists are interested in helping individuals achieve better health through public policy  education  intervention  and research
__label__0 as such  it is generally considered to be a more applied area within psychology  however  some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research
__label__1 counseling psychology is a similar discipline that focuses on emotional  social  vocational  and health  related outcomes in individuals who are considered psychologically healthy
__label__0 wilhelm wundt    was a german scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a psychologist
__label__0 his famous book entitled principles of physiological psychology was published in
__label__0 william james      was the first american psychologist who espoused a different perspective on how psychology should operate   link
__label__0 james was introduced to darwin s theory of evolution by natural selection and accepted it as an explanation of an organism s characteristics
__label__0 according to freud  the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis  by examinations of the first words that came to people s minds  and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue
__label__1 psychoanalytic theory focuses on the role of a person s unconscious  as well as early childhood experiences  and this particular perspective dominated clinical psychology for several decades  thorne  henley
__label__0 john b watson      was an influential american psychologist whose most famous work occurred during the early th century at johns hopkins university   link
__label__0 while wundt and james were concerned with understanding conscious experience  watson thought that the study of consciousness was flawed
__label__1 the skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior indicator such as a lever or a button
__label__0 when the animal pushes the button or lever  the box is able to deliver a positive reinforcement of the behavior  such as food  or a punishment  such as a noise  or a token conditioner  such as a light  that is correlated with either the positive reinforcement or punishment
__label__0 carl rogers      was also an american psychologist who  like maslow  emphasized the potential for good that exists within all people   link
__label__0 rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client  centered therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy
__label__0 we might even describe consciousness as a continuum that ranges from full awareness to a deep sleep
__label__1 sleep is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakefulness
__label__1 wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness  thought  and behavior
__label__0 this pattern of temperature fluctuation  which repeats every day  is one example of a circadian rhythm
__label__1 a circadian rhythm is a biological rhythm that takes place over a period of about  hours
__label__0 our sleep  wake cycle  which is linked to our environment s natural light  dark cycle  is perhaps the most obvious example of a circadian rhythm  but we also have daily fluctuations in heart rate  blood pressure  blood sugar  and body temperature
__label__0 the brain s clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus  scn
__label__0 the axons of light  sensitive neurons in the retina provide information to the scn based on the amount of light present  allowing this internal clock to be synchronized with the outside world  klein  moore   reppert    welsh  takahashi   kay      link
__label__1 these individual differences in circadian patterns of activity are known as a person s chronotype  and research demonstrates that morning larks and night owls differ with regard to sleep regulation  taillard  philip  coste  sagaspe   bioulac
__label__1 sleep regulation refers to the brain s control of switching between sleep and wakefulness as well as coordinating this cycle with the outside world
__label__0 individuals who do rotating shift work are also likely to experience disruptions in circadian cycles
__label__1 rotating shift work refers to a work schedule that changes from early to late on a daily or weekly basis
__label__0 for example  a person may work from  am to  pm on monday   am to  am on tuesday  and  am to  pm on wednesday
__label__0 homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound following sleep deprivation
__label__1 sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep  deprived individual will tend to take a shorter time to fall asleep during subsequent opportunities for sleep
__label__0 sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity of the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography  eeg   and different phases of sleep can be differentiated using eeg as well   link
__label__1 this is a segment of a polysonograph  psg   a recording of several physical variables during sleep
__label__0 brain waves during rem sleep appear very similar to brain waves during wakefulness
__label__0 in contrast  non  rem  nrem  sleep is subdivided into four stages distinguished from each other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves
__label__0 the first four stages of sleep are nrem sleep  while the fifth and final stage of sleep is rem sleep
__label__0 as an individual continues through stage  sleep  there is an increase in theta wave activity
__label__1 theta waves are even lower frequency     hz   higher amplitude brain waves than alpha waves
__label__0 it is relatively easy to wake someone from stage  sleep  in fact  people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage  sleep
__label__0 in addition  the appearance of k  complexes is often associated with stage  sleep
__label__1 a k  complex is a very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in some cases occur in response to environmental stimuli
__label__0 thus  k  complexes might serve as a bridge to higher levels of arousal in response to what is going on in our environments  halsz    steriade  amzica
__label__0 freud made distinctions between the manifest content and the latent content of dreams
__label__1 manifest content is the actual content  or storyline  of a dream
__label__1 latent content  on the other hand  refers to the hidden meaning of a dream
__label__0 among a variety of neurobiological evidence  john hobson cites research on lucid dreams as an opportunity to better understand dreaming in general
__label__1 lucid dreams are dreams in which certain aspects of wakefulness are maintained during a dream state
__label__0 in a lucid dream  a person becomes aware of the fact that they are dreaming  and as such  they can control the dream s content  laberge
__label__1 in sleepwalking  or somnambulism  the sleeper engages in relatively complex behaviors ranging from wandering about to driving an automobile
__label__0 during periods of sleepwalking  sleepers often have their eyes open  but they are not responsive to attempts to communicate with them
__label__1 night terrors result in a sense of panic in the sufferer and are often accompanied by screams and attempts to escape from the immediate environment  mahowald  schenck
__label__0 although individuals suffering from night terrors appear to be awake  they generally have no memories of the events that occurred  and attempts to console them are ineffective
__label__1 obstructive sleep apnea occurs when an individual s airway becomes blocked during sleep  and air is prevented from entering the lungs
__label__1 in central sleep apnea  disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing  white
__label__0 one of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep
__label__1 a continuous positive airway pressure  cpap  device includes a mask that fits over the sleeper s nose and mouth  which is connected to a pump that pumps air into the person s airways  forcing them to remain open  as shown in  link
__label__0 unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section  a person with narcolepsy can not resist falling asleep at inopportune times
__label__1 these sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy  which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness  and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles
__label__0 a person who has a substance use disorder often uses more of the substance than they originally intended to and continues to use that substance despite experiencing significant adverse consequences
__label__1 in individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder  there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence  physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions  the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use
__label__1 in contrast  a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional  rather than physical  need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress
__label__1 drug withdrawal includes a variety of negative symptoms experienced when drug use is discontinued
__label__0 these symptoms usually are opposite of the effects of the drug
__label__0 in recent years  methamphetamine  meth  use has become increasingly widespread
__label__1 methamphetamine is a type of amphetamine that can be made from ingredients that are readily available  eg  medications containing pseudoephedrine  a compound found in many over  the  counter cold and flu remedies
__label__0 despite recent changes in laws designed to make obtaining pseudoephedrine more difficult  methamphetamine continues to be an easily accessible and relatively inexpensive drug option  shukla  crump   chrisco
__label__0 nicotine is most commonly used in the form of tobacco products like cigarettes or chewing tobacco  therefore  there is a tremendous interest in developing effective smoking cessation techniques
__label__0 to date  people have used a variety of nicotine replacement therapies in addition to various psychotherapeutic options in an attempt to discontinue their use of tobacco products
__label__0 in general  smoking cessation programs may be effective in the short term  but it is unclear whether these effects persist  cropley  theadom  pravettoni   webb    levitt  shaw  wong   kaczorowski    smedslund  fisher  boles   lichtenstein
__label__0 still  people experiencing opioid withdrawal may be given methadone to make withdrawal from the drug less difficult
__label__1 methadone is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs
__label__0 methadone clinics help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of methadone
__label__1 a hallucinogen is one of a class of drugs that results in profound alterations in sensory and perceptual experiences   link
__label__0 in some cases  users experience vivid visual hallucinations
__label__1 sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific types of stimuli
__label__0 when sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor  sensation has occurred
__label__0 for example  light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye
__label__0 it has been estimated that on a clear night  the most sensitive sensory cells in the back of the eye can detect a candle flame  miles away  okawa  sampath
__label__1 under quiet conditions  the hair cells  the receptor cells of the inner ear  can detect the tick of a clock  feet away  galanter  it is also possible for us to get messages that are presented below the threshold for conscious awareness  these are called subliminal messages
__label__0 a stimulus reaches a physiological threshold when it is strong enough to excite sensory receptors and send nerve impulses to the brain  this is an absolute threshold
__label__0 perception involves both bottom  up and top  down processing
__label__1 bottom  up processing refers to the fact that perceptions are built from sensory input
__label__0 on the other hand  how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge  our experiences  and our thoughts
__label__0 because participants were so focused on the number of times the white team was passing the ball  they completely tuned out other visual information
__label__1 failure to notice something that is completely visible because of a lack of attention is called inattentional blindness
__label__0 for example  marshall segall  donald campbell  and melville herskovits    published the results of a multinational study in which they demonstrated that individuals from western cultures were more prone to experience certain types of visual illusions than individuals from non  western cultures  and vice versa
__label__0 one such illusion that westerners were more likely to experience was the mller  lyer illusion   link    the lines appear to be different lengths  but they are actually the same length
__label__0 wavelength is directly related to the frequency of a given wave form
__label__1 frequency refers to the number of waves that pass a given point in a given time period and is often expressed in terms of hertz  hz   or cycles per second
__label__1 frequency refers to the number of waves that pass a given point in a given time period and is often expressed in terms of hertz  hz   or cycles per second
__label__0 longer wavelengths will have lower frequencies  and shorter wavelengths will have higher frequencies   link
__label__0 higher amplitudes are associated with louder sounds
__label__1 loudness is measured in terms of decibels  db   a logarithmic unit of sound intensity
__label__1 loudness is measured in terms of decibels  db   a logarithmic unit of sound intensity
__label__0 a typical conversation would correlate with  db  a rock concert might check in at  db   link
__label__0 light waves are transmitted across the cornea and enter the eye through the pupil
__label__1 the cornea is the transparent covering over the eye
__label__0 it serves as a barrier between the inner eye and the outside world  and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye
__label__1 after passing through the pupil  light crosses the lens  a curved  transparent structure that serves to provide additional focus
__label__0 the lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is reflected from near or far objects
__label__0 these photoreceptor cells  known as cones  are light  detecting cells
__label__1 the cones are specialized types of photoreceptors that work best in bright light conditions
__label__0 cones are very sensitive to acute detail and provide tremendous spatial resolution
__label__0 the optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain
__label__1 there is a point in the visual field called the blind spot  even when light from a small object is focused on the blind spot  we do not see it
__label__0 we are not consciously aware of our blind spots for two reasons  first  each eye gets a slightly different view of the visual field  therefore  the blind spots do not overlap
__label__0 each of these cone types is maximally sensitive to a slightly different wavelength of light
__label__1 according to the trichromatic theory of color vision  shown in  link   all colors in the spectrum can be produced by combining red  green  and blue
__label__0 now  let s look at what happens with protectionism
__label__0 us sugar farmers are likely to argue that  if only they could be protected from sugar imported from brazil  the united states would have higher domestic sugar production  more jobs in the sugar industry  and american sugar farmers would receive a higher price
__label__0 while the united states economy does experience rises and falls in unemployment rates  according to the bureau of labor statistics  from spring  to late   the unemployment rate rose from   to    it has since fallen back to   in spring   the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time
__label__0 the number of us jobs rose from  million in  to  million in
__label__0 protectionism certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but  for two reasons  it costs jobs in other unprotected industries
__label__0 first  if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry  they inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other industries  and so jobs are lost in those other industries
__label__0 one concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high  skilled  high  wage workers in the united states  it may also impose costs on low  skilled  low  wage workers
__label__0 after all  high  skilled us workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers  machinery  and pharmaceuticals in which the united states has a comparative advantage
__label__0 meanwhile  low  skilled us workers must now compete against extremely low  wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing
__label__1 dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production
__label__1 anti  dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production
__label__0 if free trade meant the destruction of life itself  then even economists would convert to protectionism
__label__0 while globalization  and economic activity of all kinds  can pose environmental dangers  it seems quite possible that  with the appropriate safeguards in place  the environmental impacts of trade can be minimized
__label__0 the race to the bottom scenario of global environmental degradation runs like this
__label__0 profit  seeking multinational companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to countries with weak standards  thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits
__label__0 the united nations was unable to agree to this
__label__1 instead  the general agreement on tariffs and trade  gatt   was established in  to provide a forum in which nations could come together to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade
__label__0 in   the gatt was transformed into the wto
__label__0 for the united states  perhaps the best  known regional trading agreement is the north american free trade agreement  nafta
__label__1 the united states also participates in some less  prominent regional trading agreements  like the caribbean basin initiative  which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these countries  and a free trade agreement with israel
__label__0 what is a function
__label__1 a function describes a relationship
__label__0 sometimes the relationship is a definition
__label__1 the concept of slope is very useful in economics  because it measures the relationship between two variables
__label__1 a positive slope means that two variables are positively related  that is  when x increases  so does y  or when x decreases  y decreases also
__label__0 graphically  a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right  the line rises
__label__1 the graphs we have discussed so far are called line graphs  because they show a relationship between two variables  one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis
__label__1 a pie graph  sometimes called a pie chart  is used to show how an overall total is divided into parts
__label__0 a circle represents a group as a whole
__label__1 this appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences  called indifference curves  which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility
__label__0 by setting aside the assumption of putting a numerical valuation on utility  an assumption that many students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic  the indifference curve framework helps to clarify the logic of the underlying model  what is an indifference curve
__label__0 from this starting point  her marginal utility gained from extra books will be relatively low  while the marginal utility lost from additional doughnuts would be relatively high  so on the margin  it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the change of one marginal book
__label__1 in short  the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of substitution  that is  the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility constant  also changes  as a result of diminishing marginal utility of both goods
__label__0 anyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked motivations  a substitution effect and an income effect
__label__1 the substitution effect is that when a good becomes more expensive  people seek out substitutes
__label__0 if oranges become more expensive  fruit  lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples  grapefruit  or raisins
__label__0 the substitution effect tells how petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen  so that income was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive  but if she had remained at the same level of utility
__label__0 the slope of the budget constraint in a labor  leisure diagram is determined by the wage rate
__label__0 thus  the dashed line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set  reflecting the labor  leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate  but tangent to the original indifference curve  showing the same level of utility or  buying power
__label__0 the shift from original choice a to point c  which is the point of tangency between the original indifference curve and the dashed line  shows that because of the higher wage  petunia will want to consume less leisure and more income
__label__1 the expenditure  output model  sometimes also called the keynesian cross diagram  determines the equilibrium level of real gdp by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the amount of output produced
__label__0 the axes of the keynesian cross diagram presented in  link  show real gdp on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a measure of spending
__label__1 when the macroeconomy is in equilibrium  it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the real gdp  because by definition  gdp is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy
__label__0 thus  the equilibrium calculated with a keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal  which will only occur along the degree line
__label__1 the marginal propensity to consume  mpc   is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures
__label__1 the marginal propensity to save  mps  is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save
__label__0 it must always hold true that
__label__0 imports are drawn in the keynesian cross diagram as a downward  sloping line  with the downward slope determined by the marginal propensity to import  mpi   out of national income
__label__0 in  link   b   the marginal propensity to import is
__label__1 the aggregate expenditure function is formed by stacking on top of each other the consumption function  after taxes   the investment function  the government spending function  the export function  and the import function
__label__0 the point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment  government  and export expenditures  which do not vary with national income
__label__0 conversely   link   b  shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule  ae  intersects the degree line above potential gdp
__label__1 the gap between the level of real gdp at the equilibrium e and potential gdp is called an inflationary gap
__label__0 the inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting
__label__0 the familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency
__label__1 one typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another
__label__1 conversely  if a situation is inefficient  it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing costs on others  efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning  the economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved
__label__0 those producers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at    but who were instead able to charge the equilibrium price of    clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product
__label__1 the amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller s actual cost is called producer surplus
__label__0 in  link   producer surplus is the area labeled g  that is  the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium
__label__1 the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus  also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus
__label__0 in a very real sense  it is like money thrown away that benefits no one
__label__0 in  link   a   the deadweight loss is the area u  w
__label__0 when deadweight loss exists  it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus to be higher  in this case because the price control is blocking some suppliers and demanders from transactions they would both be willing to make
__label__0 a second change from the price ceiling is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers
__label__0 you may recall that  x      x     and  x
__label__1 memorizing these facts is rehearsal  another strategy is chunking  you organize information into manageable bits or chunks  bodie  powers   fitch  hauser
__label__0 chunking is useful when trying to remember information like dates and phone numbers
__label__1 use elaborative rehearsal  in a famous article  craik and lockhart    discussed their belief that information we process more deeply goes into long  term memory
__label__0 their theory is called levels of processing
__label__0 if we want to remember a piece of information  we should think about it more deeply and link it to other information and memories to make it more meaningful
__label__1 cognitive development involves learning  attention  memory  language  thinking  reasoning  and creativity
__label__1 psychosocial development involves emotions  personality  and social relationships
__label__0 we refer to these domains throughout the chapter
__label__0 not all normative events are universal  meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all cultures
__label__0 biological milestones  such as puberty  tend to be universal  but social milestones  such as the age when children begin formal schooling  are not necessarily universal  instead  they affect most individuals in a particular culture  gesell  ilg
__label__0 for example  in developed countries children begin school around  or  years old  but in developing countries  like nigeria  children often enter school at an advanced age  if at all  huebler    united nations educational  scientific  and cultural organization  unesco
__label__0 how do nature and nurture influence development
__label__1 are we who we are because of nature  biology and genetics   or are we who we are because of nurture  our environment and culture
__label__1 are we who we are because of nature  biology and genetics   or are we who we are because of nurture  our environment and culture
__label__0 this longstanding question is known in psychology as the nature versus nurture debate
__label__0 humans are diverse  and sometimes our differences make it challenging for us to get along with one another
__label__0 a poignant example is that of trayvon martin  a   year  old african american who was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer  george zimmerman  in a predominantly white neighborhood in
__label__0 zimmerman grew suspicious of the boy dressed in a hoodie and pursued martin
__label__0 erik erikson        link    another stage theorist  took freud s theory and modified it as psychosocial theory
__label__0 erikson s psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of our development rather than its sexual nature
__label__0 piaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world
__label__1 schemata are concepts  mental models  that are used to help us categorize and interpret information
__label__0 by the time children have reached adulthood  they have created schemata for almost everything
__label__1 the first stage is the sensorimotor stage  which lasts from birth to about  years old
__label__0 during this stage  children learn about the world through their senses and motor behavior
__label__0 kenny s pizza slice was cut into five pieces  so kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than she did
__label__1 children in this stage can not perform mental operations because they have not developed an understanding of conservation  which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something  it is still equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added
__label__1 children in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle of reversibility  which means that objects can be changed and then returned back to their original form or condition
__label__0 take  for example  water that you poured into the short  fat glass  you can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and still have the same amount  minus a couple of drops
__label__0 after presenting people with this and various other moral dilemmas  kohlberg reviewed people s responses and placed them in different stages of moral reasoning   link
__label__0 according to kohlberg  an individual progresses from the capacity for pre  conventional morality  before age   to the capacity for conventional morality  early adolescence   and toward attaining post  conventional morality  once formal operational thought is attained   which only a few fully achieve
__label__1 intrapersonal topics  those that pertain to the individual  include emotions and attitudes  the self  and social cognition  the ways in which we think about ourselves and others
__label__1 intrapersonal topics  those that pertain to the individual  include emotions and attitudes  the self  and social cognition  the ways in which we think about ourselves and others
__label__1 interpersonal topics  those that pertain to dyads and groups  include helping behavior   link    aggression  prejudice and discrimination  attraction and close relationships  and group processes and intergroup relationships
__label__1 in contrast  dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors  heider
__label__1 an internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes personality traits and temperament
__label__0 social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective  whereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective
__label__0 therefore  a person s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior
__label__1 in contrast  people from a collectivistic culture  that is  a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others  such as family  friends  and community   link    are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error  markus  kitayama    triandis
__label__0 people from collectivistic cultures  such as some asian cultures  are more likely to emphasize relationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual
__label__0 activities such as  a  preparing a meal   b  hanging out  and  c  playing a game engage people in a group
__label__1 we can understand self  serving bias by digging more deeply into attribution  a belief about the cause of a result
__label__0 one model of attribution proposes three main dimensions  locus of control  internal versus external   stability  stable versus unstable   and controllability  controllable versus uncontrollable
__label__0 a mother and father s dna is passed on to the child at the moment of conception
__label__1 conception occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote   link
__label__0 a zygote begins as a one  cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg merge
__label__1 after the zygote divides for about  days and has  cells  it travels down the fallopian tubes and implants itself in the lining of the uterus
__label__0 upon implantation  this multi  cellular organism is called an embryo
__label__0 now blood vessels grow  forming the placenta
__label__1 a teratogen is any environmental agent  biological  chemical  or physical  that causes damage to the developing embryo or fetus
__label__0 there are different types of teratogens
__label__1 motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects
__label__1 fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers  toes  and eyes  and enable coordination of small actions  eg  grasping a toy  writing with a pencil  and using a spoon
__label__0 in social and emotional development  forming healthy attachments is very important and is the major social milestone of infancy
__label__1 attachment is a long  standing connection or bond with others
__label__0 developmental psychologists are interested in how infants reach this milestone
__label__1 with avoidant attachment  the child is unresponsive to the parent  does not use the parent as a secure base  and does not care if the parent leaves
__label__0 the toddler reacts to the parent the same way she reacts to a stranger
__label__0 baumrind developed and refined a theory describing four parenting styles  authoritative  authoritarian  permissive  and uninvolved
__label__1 with the authoritative style  the parent gives reasonable demands and consistent limits  expresses warmth and affection  and listens to the child s point of view
__label__0 parents set rules and explain the reasons behind them
__label__1 with the uninvolved style of parenting  the parents are indifferent  uninvolved  and sometimes referred to as neglectful
__label__0 they do nt respond to the child s needs and make relatively few demands
__label__0 while the sequence of physical changes in puberty is predictable  the onset and pace of puberty vary widely
__label__0 several physical changes occur during puberty  such as adrenarche and gonadarche  the maturing of the adrenal glands and sex glands  respectively
__label__0 also during this time  primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature
__label__1 secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs  such as development of breasts and hips in girls  and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys
__label__1 girls experience menarche  the beginning of menstrual periods  usually around    years old  and boys experience spermarche  the first ejaculation  around    years old
__label__0 another aspect of positive aging is believed to be social connectedness and social support
__label__1 as we get older  socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that our social support and friendships dwindle in number  but remain as close  if not more close than in our earlier years  carstensen      link
__label__0 this shared knowledge comes from social norms
__label__1 a social norm is a group s expectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members  how they are supposed to behave and think  deutsch  gerard    berkowitz
__label__0 how are we expected to act
__label__0 zimbardo s stanford prison experiment
__label__0 the famous stanford prison experiment  conducted by social psychologist philip zimbardo and his colleagues at stanford university  demonstrated the power of social roles  social norms  and scripts
__label__0 in the summer of   an advertisement was placed in a california newspaper asking for male volunteers to participate in a study about the psychological effects of prison life
__label__0 now we turn to how the power of the situation can influence our attitudes and beliefs
__label__1 attitude is our evaluation of a person  an idea  or an object
__label__0 we have attitudes for many things ranging from products that we might pick up in the supermarket to people around the world to political policies
__label__0 the military example demonstrates the observation that a difficult initiation into a group influences us to like the group more  due to the justification of effort
__label__0 we do not want to have wasted time and effort to join a group that we eventually leave
__label__0 the topic of persuasion has been one of the most extensively researched areas in social psychology  fiske et al
__label__0 during the second world war  carl hovland extensively researched persuasion for the us army
__label__0 after the war  hovland continued his exploration of persuasion at yale university
__label__0 the central route is logic driven and uses data and facts to convince people of an argument s worthiness
__label__0 for example  a car company seeking to persuade you to purchase their model will emphasize the car s safety features and fuel economy
__label__0 solomon asch conducted several experiments in the s to determine how people are affected by the thoughts and behaviors of other people
__label__0 in one study  a group of participants was shown a series of printed line segments of different lengths  a  b  and c   link
__label__1 the asch effect is the influence of the group majority on an individual s judgment
__label__0 what factors make a person more likely to yield to group pressure
__label__0 research shows that the size of the majority  the presence of another dissenter  and the public or relatively private nature of responses are key influences on conformity
__label__1 in normative social influence  people conform to the group norm to fit in  to feel good  and to be accepted by the group
__label__1 however  with informational social influence  people conform because they believe the group is competent and has the correct information  particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous
__label__0 what type of social influence was operating in the asch conformity studies
__label__0 several variations of the original milgram experiment were conducted to test the boundaries of obedience
__label__0 when certain features of the situation were changed  participants were less likely to continue to deliver shocks  milgram
__label__0 sometimes being in a group situation can improve performance
__label__1 social facilitation occurs when an individual performs better when an audience is watching than when the individual performs the behavior alone
__label__0 this typically occurs when people are performing a task for which they are skilled
__label__0 the field of i  o psychology can be divided into three broad areas   link  and  link    industrial  organizational  and human factors
__label__1 industrial psychology is concerned with describing job requirements and assessing individuals for their ability to meet those requirements
__label__0 in addition  once employees are hired  industrial psychology studies and develops ways to train  evaluate  and respond to those evaluations
__label__0 scott was one of the first psychologists to apply psychology to advertising  management  and personnel selection
__label__0 in   scott published two books  the theory of advertising and psychology of advertising
__label__0 parallel to these studies in industrial and organizational psychology  the field of human factors psychology was also developing
__label__0 frederick taylor was an engineer who saw that if one could redesign the workplace there would be an increase in both output for the company and wages for the workers
__label__0 in  he put forward his theory in a book titled  the principles of scientific management   link
__label__0 these differences may be difficult for some people to reconcile  which may lead to prejudice toward people who are different
__label__1 prejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an individual based solely on one s membership in a particular social group  allport    brown
__label__0 prejudice is common against people who are members of an unfamiliar cultural group
__label__1 racism is prejudice and discrimination against an individual based solely on one s membership in a specific racial group  such as toward african americans  asian americans  latinos  native americans  european americans
__label__0 what are some stereotypes of various racial or ethnic groups
__label__1 another form of prejudice is homophobia  prejudice and discrimination of individuals based solely on their sexual orientation
__label__0 like ageism  homophobia is a widespread prejudice in us society that is tolerated by many people  herek  mclemore    nosek
__label__0 when we hold a stereotype about a person  we have expectations that he or she will fulfill that stereotype
__label__1 a self  fulfilling prophecy is an expectation held by a person that alters his or her behavior in a way that tends to make it true
__label__0 these groups serve as our in  groups
__label__1 an in  group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to
__label__1 a group that we do nt belong to  or an out  group  is a group that we view as fundamentally different from us
__label__0 this often happens by blaming an out  group for the problem
__label__1 scapegoating is the act of blaming an out  group when the in  group experiences frustration or is blocked from obtaining a goal  allport
__label__1 hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of anger with intent to cause pain  a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile aggression
__label__1 in contrast  instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not necessarily involve intent to cause pain  berkowitz     a contract killer who murders for hire displays instrumental aggression
__label__0 although there is not one single personality profile for who becomes a bully and who becomes a victim of bullying  apa     researchers have identified some patterns in children who are at a greater risk of being bullied  olweus
__label__0 based on this case  researchers latan and darley    described a phenomenon called the bystander effect
__label__1 the bystander effect is a phenomenon in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to help a victim or person in distress
__label__0 instead  they just watch what is happening
__label__0 research suggests there are many other reasons
__label__1 altruism is people s desire to help others even if the costs outweigh the benefits of helping
__label__0 in fact  people acting in altruistic ways may disregard the personal costs associated with helping   link
__label__0 once we form relationships with people  we desire reciprocity
__label__1 reciprocity is the give and take in relationships
__label__0 we contribute to relationships  but we expect to receive benefits as well
__label__1 sternberg    states that a healthy relationship will have all three components of love  intimacy  passion  and commitment  which is described as consummate love   link
__label__0 however  different aspects of love might be more prevalent at different life stages
__label__0 one theory that provides an explanation is social exchange theory
__label__1 according to social exchange theory  we act as nave economists in keeping a tally of the ratio of costs and benefits of forming and maintaining a relationship with others   link    rusbult  van lange
__label__0 you might be wondering if psychology research can tell you how to succeed in a job interview
__label__0 as you can imagine  most research is concerned with the employer s interest in choosing the most appropriate candidate for the job  a goal that makes sense for the candidate too
__label__1 title vii of the civil rights act of  makes it illegal to treat individuals unfavorably because of their race or color of their skin  an employer can not discriminate based on skin color  hair texture  or other immutable characteristics  which are traits of an individual that are fundamental to her identity  in hiring  benefits  promotions  or termination of employees
__label__1 title vii of the civil rights act of  makes it illegal to treat individuals unfavorably because of their race or color of their skin  an employer can not discriminate based on skin color  hair texture  or other immutable characteristics  which are traits of an individual that are fundamental to her identity  in hiring  benefits  promotions  or termination of employees
__label__1 the pregnancy discrimination act of  amends the civil rights act  it prohibits job  eg  employment  pay  and termination  discrimination of a woman because she is pregnant as long as she can perform the work required
__label__0 organizational psychology is the second major branch of study and practice within the discipline of industrial and organizational psychology
__label__1 in organizational psychology  the focus is on social interactions and their effect on the individual and on the functioning of the organization
__label__0 in this section  you will learn about the work organizational psychologists have done to understand job satisfaction  different styles of management  different styles of leadership  organizational culture  and teamwork
__label__1 downsizing is an increasingly common response to a business s pronounced failure to achieve profit goals  and it involves laying off a significant percentage of the company s employees
__label__0 industrial  organizational psychologists may be involved in all aspects of downsizing  how the news is delivered to employees  both those being let go and those staying   how laid  off employees are supported  eg  separation packages   and how retained employees are supported
__label__0 a significant portion of i  o research focuses on management and human relations
__label__1 douglas mcgregor    combined scientific management  a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflows with the main objective of improving economic efficiency  especially labor productivity  and human relations into the notion of leadership behavior
__label__0 his theory lays out two different styles called theory x and theory y
__label__0 bass    popularized and developed the concepts of transactional leadership versus transformational leadership styles
__label__1 in transactional leadership  the focus is on supervision and organizational goals  which are achieved through a system of rewards and punishments  ie  transactions
__label__1 transactional leaders maintain the status quo  they are managers
__label__0 each company and organization has an organizational culture
__label__1 organizational culture encompasses the values  visions  hierarchies  norms  and interactions among its employees
__label__0 it is how an organization is run  how it operates  and how it makes decisions  the industry in which the organization participates may have an influence
__label__0 the us
__label__0 equal employment opportunity commission  nd   provides the following description of sexual harassment
__label__1 whereas the two other areas of i  o psychology focus on the interface between the worker and team  group  or organization  human factors psychology focuses on the individual worker s interaction with a machine  work station  information displays  and the local environment  such as lighting
__label__0 in the united states  human factors psychology has origins in both psychology and engineering  this is reflected in the early contributions of lillian gilbreth  psychologist and engineer  and her husband frank gilbreth  engineer
__label__0 these conceptualizations are referred to as response  based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions
__label__1 for example  the endocrinologist hans selye  a famous stress researcher  once defined stress as the  response of the body to any demand  whether it is caused by  or results in  pleasant or unpleasant conditions   selye    p
__label__0 selye s definition of stress is response  based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the body s physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it
__label__0 two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard  primary and secondary appraisals
__label__1 a primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harm or threat to well  being that a stressor might entail
__label__0 a stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm  loss  or other negative consequence  conversely  a stressor would likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth
__label__0 a person at this stress level is colloquially at the top of his game  meaning he feels fully energized  focused  and can work with minimal effort and maximum efficiency
__label__1 but when stress exceeds this optimal level  it is no longer a positive force  it becomes excessive and debilitating  or what selye termed distress  from the latin dis   bad
__label__0 people who reach this level of stress feel burned out  they are fatigued  exhausted  and their performance begins to decline
__label__0 your heart starts to pound and speeds up  you begin to breathe heavily and perspire  you get butterflies in your stomach  and your muscles become tense  preparing you to take some kind of direct action
__label__1 cannon proposed that this reaction  which he called the fight  or  flight response  occurs when a person experiences very strong emotions  especially those associated with a perceived threat  cannon
__label__0 during the fight  or  flight response  the body is rapidly aroused by activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine system   link
__label__0 the general adaptation syndrome  shown in  link   consists of three stages     alarm reaction     stage of resistance  and    stage of exhaustion  selye
__label__1 alarm reaction describes the body s immediate reaction upon facing a threatening situation or emergency  and it is roughly analogous to the fight  or  flight response described by cannon
__label__0 during an alarm reaction  you are alerted to a stressor  and your body alarms you with a cascade of physiological reactions that provide you with the energy to manage the situation
__label__0 what goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress
__label__0 the physiological mechanisms of stress are extremely complex  but they generally involve the work of two systems  the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic  pituitary  adrenal  hpa  axis
__label__0 when a person first perceives something as stressful  selye s alarm reaction   the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands
__label__1 the sociocultural perspective looks at you  your behaviors  and your symptoms in the context of your culture and background
__label__0 for example  jos is an year  old hispanic male from a traditional family
__label__0 in the s  psychiatrists thomas holmes and richard rahe wanted to examine the link between life stressors and physical illness  based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person s normal life routines are stressful  whether these events are desirable or undesirable
__label__0 they developed the social readjustment rating scale  srrs   consisting of  life events that require varying degrees of personal readjustment  holmes  rahe
__label__0 potential stressors do not always involve major life events
__label__0 daily hassles  the minor irritations and annoyances that are part of our everyday lives  eg  rush hour traffic  lost keys  obnoxious coworkers  inclement weather  arguments with friends or family   can build on one another and leave us just as stressed as life change events   link    kanner  coyne  schaefer   lazarus
__label__0 this helps explain why relapse rates tend to be high
__label__1 about      of individuals relapse  which means they return to abusing drugs andor alcohol after a period of improvement  national institute on drug abuse  nida
__label__0 in this section  we will discuss stress and illness
__label__0 as stress researcher robert sapolsky    describes
__label__0 in addition  the immune system may sometimes break down and be unable to do its job
__label__1 this situation is referred to as immunosuppression  the decreased effectiveness of the immune system
__label__0 when people experience immunosuppression  they become susceptible to any number of infections  illness  and diseases
__label__0 shortened telomeres can inhibit or block cell division  which includes growth and proliferation of new cells  thereby leading to more rapid aging  sapolsky
__label__0 in the study  researchers compared telomere lengths in the white blood cells in mothers of chronically ill children to those of mothers of healthy children  epel et al
__label__0 mothers of chronically ill children would be expected to experience more stress than would mothers of healthy children
__label__1 these individuals tend to be intensively driven workaholics who are preoccupied with deadlines and always seem to be in a rush
__label__1 according to friedman and rosenman  these individuals exhibit type a behavior pattern  those who are more relaxed and laid  back were characterized as type b   link
__label__0 in a sample of type as and type bs  friedman and rosenman were startled to discover that heart disease was over seven times more frequent among the type as than the type bs  friedman  rosenman
__label__1 perhaps the first to recognize the link between depression and heart disease was benjamin malzberg     who found that the death rate among institutionalized patients with melancholia  an archaic term for depression  was six times higher than that of the population
__label__0 a classic study in the late s looked at over  manic  depressive persons in denmark  finding a nearly   increase in deaths from heart disease among these patients compared with the general danish population  weeke
__label__0 the therapist informs the client about confidentiality  fees  and what to expect in treatment
__label__1 confidentiality means the therapist can not disclose confidential communications to any third party unless mandated or permitted by law to do so
__label__0 during the intake  the therapist and client will work together to discuss treatment goals
__label__1 couples therapy involves two people in an intimate relationship who are having difficulties and are trying to resolve them   link
__label__0 the couple may be dating  partnered  engaged  or married
__label__1 in strategic family therapy  the goal is to address specific problems within the family that can be dealt with in a relatively short amount of time
__label__0 typically  the therapist would guide what happens in the therapy session and design a detailed approach to resolving each member s problem  madanes
__label__0 psychoanalysis was developed by sigmund freud and was the first form of psychotherapy
__label__0 it was the dominant therapeutic technique in the early th century  but it has since waned significantly in popularity
__label__0 freud suggested that during this patient  therapist relationship  the patient comes to develop strong feelings for the therapist  maybe positive feelings  maybe negative feelings
__label__1 freud called this transference  the patient transfers all the positive or negative emotions associated with the patient s other relationships to the psychoanalyst
__label__0 for example  crystal is seeing a psychoanalyst
__label__1 in psychoanalysis  therapists help their patients look into their past to uncover repressed feelings
__label__1 in behavior therapy  a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable behaviors  rather than digging deeply into one s unconscious
__label__0 two counterconditioning techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy
__label__1 aversive conditioning uses an unpleasant stimulus to stop an undesirable behavior
__label__0 therapists apply this technique to eliminate addictive behaviors  such as smoking  nail biting  and drinking
__label__0 sometimes  it s too impractical  expensive  or embarrassing to re  create anxiety  producing situations  so a therapist might employ virtual reality exposure therapy by using a simulation to help conquer fears
__label__1 virtual reality exposure therapy has been used effectively to treat numerous anxiety disorders such as the fear of public speaking  claustrophobia  fear of enclosed spaces   aviophobia  fear of flying   and post  traumatic stress disorder  ptsd   a trauma and stressor  related disorder  gerardi  cukor  difede  rizzo   rothbaum
__label__0 cognitive therapy was developed by psychiatrist aaron beck in the s
__label__0 his initial focus was on depression and how a client s self  defeating attitude served to maintain a depression despite positive factors in her life  beck  rush  shaw   emery      link
__label__1 humanistic psychology focuses on helping people achieve their potential
__label__0 so it makes sense that the goal of humanistic therapy is to help people become more self  aware and accepting of themselves
__label__0 in contrast to psychoanalysis  humanistic therapists focus on conscious rather than unconscious thoughts
__label__0 in active listening  the therapist acknowledges  restates  and clarifies what the client expresses
__label__1 therapists also practice what rogers called unconditional positive regard  which involves not judging clients and simply accepting them for who they are
__label__0 rogers    also felt that therapists should demonstrate genuineness  empathy  and acceptance toward their clients because this helps people become more accepting of themselves  which results in personal growth
__label__0 as we learned in the previous section  stress  especially if it is chronic  takes a toll on our bodies and can have enormously negative health implications
__label__0 when we experience events in our lives that we appraise as stressful  it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress

__label__1 in some cases  emotion  focused coping strategies involve reappraisal  whereby the stressor is construed differently  and somewhat self  deceptively  without changing its objective level of threat  lazarus  folkman
__label__0 for example  a person sentenced to federal prison who thinks   this will give me a great chance to network with others   is using reappraisal
__label__0 building strong interpersonal relationships with others helps us establish a network of close  caring individuals who can provide social support in times of distress  sorrow  and fear
__label__1 social support can be thought of as the soothing impact of friends  family  and acquaintances  baron  kerr
__label__0 social support can take many forms  including advice  guidance  encouragement  acceptance  emotional comfort  and tangible assistance  such as financial help
__label__0 beyond having a sense of control and establishing social support networks  there are numerous other means by which we can manage stress   link
__label__0 a common technique people use to combat stress is exercise  salmon
__label__0 it is well  established that exercise  both of long  aerobic  and short  anaerobic  duration  is beneficial for both physical and mental health  everly  lating
__label__1 the relaxation response approach is conceptualized as a general approach to stress reduction that reduces sympathetic arousal  and it has been used effectively to treat people with high blood pressure  benson  proctor
__label__0 another technique to combat stress  biofeedback  was developed by gary schwartz at harvard university in the early s
__label__1 biofeedback is a technique that uses electronic equipment to accurately measure a person s neuromuscular and autonomic activity  feedback is provided in the form of visual or auditory signals
__label__0 measuring happiness and well  being at the societal level over time may assist policy makers in determining if people are generally happy or miserable  as well as when and why they might feel the way they do
__label__0 studies show that average national happiness scores  over time and across countries  relate strongly to six key variables  per capita gross domestic product  gdp  which reflects a nation s economic standard of living   social support  freedom to make important life choices  healthy life expectancy  freedom from perceived corruption in government and business  and generosity  helliwell et al
__label__0 qualities that help promote psychological well  being  eg  having meaning and purpose in life  a sense of autonomy  positive emotions  and satisfaction with life  are linked with a range of favorable health outcomes  especially improved cardiovascular health  mainly through their relationships with biological functions and health behaviors  such as diet  physical activity  and sleep quality   boehm  kubzansky
__label__1 the quality that has received attention is positive affect  which refers to pleasurable engagement with the environment  such as happiness  joy  enthusiasm  alertness  and excitement  watson  clark   tellegen
__label__0 the characteristics of positive affect  as with negative affect  discussed earlier   can be brief  long  lasting  or trait  like  pressman  cohen
__label__0 by the th century  people who were considered odd and unusual were placed in asylums   link
__label__1 asylums were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychological disorders  but the focus was ostracizing them from society rather than treating their disorders
__label__0 often these people were kept in windowless dungeons  beaten  chained to their beds  and had little to no contact with caregivers
__label__0 this legislation changed how mental health services were delivered in the united states
__label__1 it started the process of deinstitutionalization  the closing of large asylums  by providing for people to stay in their communities and be treated locally
__label__0 in   there were  severely mentally ill patients institutionalized at public hospitals  torrey
__label__0 however  there are a group of conditions that  when present  are diagnosed early in childhood  often before the time a child enters school
__label__1 these conditions are listed in the dsm as neurodevelopmental disorders  and they involve developmental problems in personal  social  academic  and intellectual functioning  apa
__label__0 in this section  we will discuss two such disorders  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism
__label__0 the previous edition of the dsm included a diagnosis of asperger s disorder  generally recognized as a less severe form of autistic disorder  individuals diagnosed with asperger s disorder were described as having average or high intelligence and a strong vocabulary  but exhibiting impairments in social interaction and social communication  such as talking only about their special interests  wing  gould   gillberg
__label__0 however  because research has failed to demonstrate that asperger s disorder differs qualitatively from autistic disorder  the dsm does not include it  which is prompting concerns among some parents that their children may no longer be eligible for special services   asperger s syndrome dropped
__label__0 some individuals with autism spectrum disorder  particularly those with better language and intellectual skills  can live and work independently as adults
__label__1 amnesia refers to the partial or total forgetting of some experience or event
__label__1 an individual with dissociative amnesia is unable to recall important personal information  usually following an extremely stressful or traumatic experience such as combat  natural disasters  or being the victim of violence

__label__0 entire villages disappeared
__label__0 in an agrarian society  the seasons dictate the rhythm of life
__label__0 everyone in europe s feudal society had a job to do and worked hard
__label__0 muslims  however  retained control of much of spain  where crdoba  known for leather and wool production  became a major center of learning and trade
__label__1 by the eleventh century  a major christian holy war called the reconquista  or reconquest  had begun to slowly push the muslims from spain
__label__1 this drive was actually an extension of the earlier military conflict between christians and muslims for domination of the holy land  the biblical region of palestine   known as the crusades

__label__0 although there were large trading centers along these rivers  most west africans lived in small villages and identified with their extended family or their clan
__label__1 wives  children  and dependents  including slaves  were a sign of wealth among men  and polygyny  the practice of having more than one wife at a time  was widespread
__label__0 in time of need  relatives  however far away  were counted upon to assist in supplying food or security
__label__1 some scholars believe that between nine and fifteen thousand years ago  a land bridge existed between asia and north america that we now call beringia
__label__0 the first inhabitants of what would be named the americas migrated across this bridge in search of food
__label__0 they counseled the chief and passed on the traditions of the tribe
__label__0 this matriarchy changed dramatically with the coming of the europeans  who introduced  sometimes forcibly  their own customs and traditions to the natives
__label__0 both arguments struck a chord
__label__0 in the early s  wealthy english merchants and the landed elite began to pool their resources to form joint stock companies
__label__1 in this novel business arrangement  which was in many ways the precursor to the modern corporation  investors provided the capital for and assumed the risk of a venture in order to reap significant returns
__label__0 for this reason  pilgrims are known as separatists
__label__0 like jamestown  plymouth occupies an iconic place in american national memory
__label__0 the tale of the  migrants who crossed the atlantic aboard the mayflower and their struggle for survival is a well  known narrative of the founding of the country
__label__1 their story includes the signing of the mayflower compact  a written agreement whereby the english voluntarily agreed to help each other
__label__0 american silver  tobacco  and other items  which were used by native peoples for ritual purposes  became european commodities with a monetary value that could be bought and sold
__label__1 before the arrival of the spanish  for example  the inca people of the andes consumed chicha  a corn beer  for ritual purposes only
__label__0 when the spanish discovered chicha  they bought and traded for it  turning it into a commodity instead of a ritual substance
__label__0 in eastern north america  some native peoples interpreted death from disease as a hostile act
__label__1 some groups  including the iroquois  engaged in raids or  mourning wars   taking enemy prisoners in order to assuage their grief and replace the departed
__label__1 in a special ritual  the prisoners were  requickened   assigned the identity of a dead person  and adopted by the bereaved family to take the place of their dead
__label__1 columbus s  letter  or probanza de mrito  proof of merit   describing his  discovery  of a new world did much to inspire excitement in europe
__label__0 probanzas de mritos were reports and letters written by spaniards in the new world to the spanish crown  designed to win royal patronage
__label__1 calvinism emphasized human powerlessness before an omniscient god and stressed the idea of predestination  the belief that god selected a few chosen people for salvation while everyone else was predestined to damnation
__label__1 calvinism emphasized human powerlessness before an omniscient god and stressed the idea of predestination  the belief that god selected a few chosen people for salvation while everyone else was predestined to damnation
__label__0 calvinists believed that reading scripture prepared sinners  if they were among the elect  to receive god s grace
__label__0 nonetheless  those indentured servants who completed their term of service often began new lives as tobacco planters
__label__1 to entice even more migrants to the new world  the virginia company also implemented the headright system  in which those who paid their own passage to virginia received fifty acres plus an additional fifty for each servant or family member they brought with them
__label__0 the headright system and the promise of a new life for servants acted as powerful incentives for english migrants to hazard the journey to the new world
__label__1 in   the victorious menndez founded st augustine  now the oldest european settlement in the americas
__label__0 in the process  the spanish displaced the local timucua indians from their ancient town of seloy  which had stood for thousands of years   link
__label__0 the timucua suffered greatly from diseases introduced by the spanish  shrinking from a population of around  pre  contact to fifty thousand in
__label__0 everywhere  africans resisted slavery  and running away was common
__label__1 in jamaica and elsewhere  runaway slaves created maroon communities  groups that resisted recapture and eked out a living from the land  rebuilding their communities as best they could
__label__0 when possible  they adhered to traditional ways  following spiritual leaders such as vodun priests
__label__0 conflict with native peoples  as well as dissatisfaction with the dutch west india company s trading practices  made the dutch outpost an undesirable place for many migrants
__label__0 the small size of the population meant a severe labor shortage  and to complete the arduous tasks of early settlement  the dutch west india company imported some  african slaves between  and
__label__1 the company had involved itself heavily in the slave trade and in  captured elmina  the slave  trading post on the west coast of africa  from the portuguese
__label__1 the final imperial war  the french and indian war       known as the seven years  war      in europe  proved to be the decisive contest between britain and france in america
__label__0 it began over rival claims along the frontier in present  day western pennsylvania
__label__1 in england  opponents of james ii s efforts to create a centralized catholic state were known as whigs
__label__1 the whigs worked to depose james  and in late  they succeeded  an event they celebrated as the glorious revolution while james fled to the court of louis xiv in france
__label__0 william iii  william of orange  and his wife mary ii ascended the throne in
__label__1 the enlightenment  or the age of reason  was an intellectual and cultural movement in the eighteenth century that emphasized reason over superstition and science over blind faith
__label__0 using the power of the press  enlightenment thinkers like john locke  isaac newton  and voltaire questioned accepted knowledge and spread new ideas about openness  investigation  and religious tolerance throughout europe and the americas
__label__0 oglethorpe s vision for georgia followed the ideals of the age of reason  seeing it as a place for england s  worthy poor  to start anew
__label__0 to encourage industry  he gave each male immigrant fifty acres of land  tools  and a year s worth of supplies
__label__1 his policies in the s through the s established and supported the restoration colonies  the carolinas  new jersey  new york  and pennsylvania
__label__1 all the restoration colonies started as proprietary colonies  that is  the king gave each colony to a trusted individual  family  or group
__label__0 slavery formed a cornerstone of the british empire in the eighteenth century
__label__0 every colony had slaves  from the southern rice plantations in charles town  south carolina  to the northern wharves of boston
__label__0 well aware of the problems on the frontier  the british government took steps to try to prevent bloodshed and another costly war
__label__1 at the beginning of pontiac s uprising  the british issued the proclamation of   which forbade white settlement west of the proclamation line  a borderline running along the spine of the appalachian mountains   link
__label__1 at the beginning of pontiac s uprising  the british issued the proclamation of   which forbade white settlement west of the proclamation line  a borderline running along the spine of the appalachian mountains   link
__label__0 the proclamation line aimed to forestall further conflict on the frontier  the clear flashpoint of tension in british north america
__label__1 samuel adams  along with joseph warren and james otis  re  formed the boston committee of correspondence  which functioned as a form of shadow government  to address the fear of british overreach
__label__0 soon towns all over massachusetts had formed their own committees  and many other colonies followed suit
__label__0 american patriots renamed the coercive and quebec measures the intolerable acts
__label__0 some in london also thought the acts went too far  see the cartoon  the able doctor  or america swallowing the bitter draught    link   for one british view of what parliament was doing to the colonies
__label__0 parliament also asserted its prerogative in  with the quartering act
__label__1 the quartering act of  addressed the problem of housing british soldiers stationed in the american colonies
__label__0 there they exhibited a fine example of industry  by spinning from sunrise until dark  and displayed a spirit for saving their sinking country rarely to be found among persons of more age and experience
__label__0 at dinner  they  cheerfully agreed to omit tea  to render their conduct consistent
__label__0 besides this instance of their patriotism  before they separated  they unanimously resolved that the stamp act was unconstitutional  that they would purchase no more british manufactures unless it be repealed  and that they would not even admit the addresses of any gentlemen should they have the opportunity  without they determined to oppose its execution to the last extremity  if the occasion required
__label__0 the daughters  non  importation movement broadened the protest against the stamp act  giving women a new and active role in the political dissent of the time
__label__0 women were responsible for purchasing goods for the home  so by exercising the power of the purse  they could wield more power than they had in the past
__label__0 conflict turned deadly on march     in a confrontation that came to be known as the boston massacre
__label__1 on that night  a crowd of bostonians from many walks of life started throwing snowballs  rocks  and sticks at the british soldiers guarding the customs house
__label__0 in june  general gage resolved to take breed s hill and bunker hill  the high ground across the charles river from boston  a strategic site that gave the rebel militias an advantage since they could train their cannons on the british
__label__1 in the battle of bunker hill   link    on june   the british launched three assaults on the hills  gaining control only after the rebels ran out of ammunition
__label__0 in this way  paine helped to channel colonial discontent toward the king himself and not  as had been the case  toward the british parliament  a bold move that signaled the desire to create a new political order disavowing monarchy entirely
__label__1 he argued for the creation of an american republic  a state without a king  and extolled the blessings of republicanism  a political philosophy that held that elected representatives  not a hereditary monarch  should govern states
__label__1 the vision of an american republic put forward by paine included the idea of popular sovereignty  citizens in the republic would determine who would represent them  and decide other issues  on the basis of majority rule
__label__0 intent on raising revolutionary morale after the british captured new york city  he launched surprise strikes against british forces in their winter quarters
__label__1 in trenton  new jersey  he led his soldiers across the delaware river and surprised an encampment of hessians  german mercenaries hired by great britain to put down the american rebellion
__label__0 beginning the night of december     and continuing into the early hours of december   washington moved on trenton where the hessians were encamped
__label__1 during the war  all the states passed confiscation acts  which gave the new revolutionary governments in the former colonies the right to seize loyalist land and property
__label__0 to ferret out loyalists  revolutionary governments also passed laws requiring the male population to take oaths of allegiance to the new states
__label__1 while republicanism offered an alternative to monarchy  it was also an alternative to democracy  a system of government characterized by majority rule  where the majority of citizens have the power to make decisions binding upon the whole
__label__0 to many revolutionaries  especially wealthy landowners  merchants  and planters  democracy did not offer a good replacement for monarchy
__label__1 in eighteenth  century america  as in great britain  the legal status of married women was defined as coverture  meaning a married woman  or feme covert  had no legal or economic status independent of her husband
__label__1 in eighteenth  century america  as in great britain  the legal status of married women was defined as coverture  meaning a married woman  or feme covert  had no legal or economic status independent of her husband
__label__0 she could not conduct business or buy and sell property
__label__0 responding to a request for advice on proper government from north carolina  adams wrote thoughts on government  which influenced many state legislatures
__label__0 adams did not advocate democracy  rather  he wrote   there is no good government but what is republican
__label__0 fearing the potential for tyranny with only one group in power  he suggested a system of checks and balances in which three separate branches of government  executive  legislative  and judicial  would maintain a balance of power
__label__0 he also proposed that each state remain sovereign  as its own republic
__label__1 james madison put forward a proposition known as the virginia plan  which called for a strong national government that could overturn state laws   link
__label__0 the plan featured a bicameral or two  house legislature  with an upper and a lower house
__label__0 the virginia plan s call for proportional representation alarmed the representatives of the smaller states
__label__1 william paterson introduced a new jersey plan to counter madison s scheme  proposing that all states have equal votes in a unicameral national legislature
__label__0 he also addressed the economic problems of the day by calling for the congress to have the power to regulate commerce  to raise revenue though taxes on imports and through postage  and to enforce congressional requisitions from the states
__label__0 thus  to avoid giving the people too much direct power  the delegates made certain that senators were chosen by the state legislatures  not elected directly by the people  direct elections of senators came with the seventeenth amendment to the constitution  ratified in
__label__1 as an additional safeguard  the delegates created the electoral college  the mechanism for choosing the president
__label__0 under this plan  each state has a certain number of electors  which is its number of senators  two  plus its number of representatives in the house of representatives
__label__0 federalists followed through on their promise to add such a bill in   when virginia representative james madison introduced and congress approved the bill of rights   link
__label__1 adopted in   the bill consisted of the first ten amendments to the constitution and outlined many of the personal rights state constitutions already guaranteed
__label__1 opposition to the federalists led to the formation of democratic  republican societies  composed of men who felt the domestic policies of the washington administration were designed to enrich the few while ignoring everyone else
__label__0 democratic  republicans championed limited government
__label__0 their fear of centralized power originated in the experience of the s and s when the distant  overbearing  and seemingly corrupt british parliament attempted to impose its will on the colonies
__label__0 president washington and hamilton denounced gent  knowing his actions threatened to pull the united states into a war with great britain
__label__0 the citizen gent affair  as it became known  spurred great britain to instruct its naval commanders in the west indies to seize all ships trading with the french
__label__0 the british captured hundreds of american ships and their cargoes  increasing the possibility of war between the two countries
__label__0 in this tense situation  great britain worked to prevent a wider conflict by ending its seizure of american ships and offered to pay for captured cargoes
__label__1 the revolution of  refers to the first transfer of power from one party to another in american history  when the presidency passed to democratic  republican thomas jefferson   link   in the  election
__label__0 the peaceful transition calmed contemporary fears about possible violent reactions to a new party s taking the reins of government
__label__0 the british then boarded the ship and took four sailors
__label__0 jefferson chose what he thought was the best of his limited options and responded to the crisis through the economic means of a sweeping ban on trade  the embargo act of
__label__1 this law prohibited american ships from leaving their ports until britain and france stopped seizing them on the high seas
__label__0 in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century  merchants in the northeast and elsewhere turned their attention as never before to the benefits of using unskilled wage labor to make a greater profit by reducing labor costs
__label__1 they used the putting  out system  which the british had employed at the beginning of their own industrial revolution  whereby they hired farming families to perform specific tasks in the production process for a set wage
__label__0 in the case of shoes  for instance  american merchants hired one group of workers to cut soles into standardized sizes
__label__0 critics of industrialization blamed it for the increased concentration of wealth in the hands of the few  the factory owners made vast profits while the workers received only a small fraction of the revenue from what they produced
__label__1 under the labor theory of value  said critics  the value of a product should accurately reflect the labor needed to produce it
__label__0 profits from the sale of goods produced by workers should be distributed so laborers recovered in the form of wages the value their effort had added to the finished product
__label__1 many americans were struck with  land fever   farmers strove to expand their acreage  and those who lived in areas where unoccupied land was scarce sought holdings in the west
__label__0 they needed money to purchase this land  however
__label__0 one key part of the transportation revolution was the widespread building of roads and turnpikes
__label__1 in   construction began on the cumberland road  a national highway that provided thousands with a route from maryland to illinois
__label__0 the federal government funded this important artery to the west  beginning the creation of a transportation infrastructure for the benefit of settlers and farmers
__label__1 this class of upwardly mobile citizens promoted temperance  or abstinence from alcohol
__label__0 they also gave their support to protestant ministers like charles grandison finney  who preached that all people possessed free moral agency  meaning they could change their lives and bring about their own salvation  a message that resonated with members of the middle class  who already believed their worldly efforts had led to their economic success
__label__0 under the leadership of martin van buren  new york s  bucktail  republican faction  so named because members wore a deer s tail on their hats  a symbol of membership in the tammany society  gained political power by cultivating loyalty to the will of the majority  not to an elite family or renowned figure
__label__0 the bucktails emphasized a pragmatic approach
__label__0 for example  at first they opposed the erie canal project  but when the popularity of the massive transportation venture became clear  they supported it
__label__0 secretary of state clay championed what was known as the american system of high tariffs  a national bank  and federally sponsored internal improvements of canals and roads
__label__0 once in office  president adams embraced clay s american system and proposed a national university and naval academy to train future leaders of the republic
__label__0 in addition to dealing with rancor over rotation in office  the jackson administration became embroiled in a personal scandal known as the petticoat affair
__label__0 this incident exacerbated the division between the president s team and the insider class in the nation s capital  who found the new arrivals from tennessee lacking in decorum and propriety
__label__0 as jackson portrayed it  his was a battle for small government and ordinary americans
__label__0 his stand against what bank opponents called the  monster bank  proved very popular  and the democratic press lionized him for it   link
__label__1 in the election of   jackson received nearly  percent of the popular vote against his opponent henry clay
__label__0 jackson s anti  indian stance struck a chord with a majority of white citizens  many of whom shared a hatred of nonwhites that spurred congress to pass the  indian removal act
__label__1 the act called for the removal of the five civilized tribes from their home in the southeastern united states to land in the west  in present  day oklahoma
__label__0 the presidential election contest of  marked the culmination of the democratic revolution that swept the united states
__label__1 by this time  the second party system had taken hold  a system whereby the older federalist and democratic  republican parties had been replaced by the new democratic and whig parties
__label__0 both whigs and democrats jockeyed for election victories and commanded the steady loyalty of political partisans
__label__0 to head the expedition into the louisiana territory  jefferson appointed his friend and personal secretary  twenty  nine  year  old army captain meriwether lewis  who was instructed to form a corps of discovery
__label__0 lewis in turn selected william clark  who had once been his commanding officer  to help him lead the group   link
__label__0 congress finally came to an agreement  called the missouri compromise  in
__label__1 missouri and maine  which had been part of massachusetts  would enter the union at the same time  maine as a free state  missouri as a slave state
__label__1 an empresario was someone who brought settlers to the region in exchange for generous grants of land
__label__1 moses austin  a once  prosperous entrepreneur reduced to poverty by the panic of   requested permission to settle three hundred english  speaking american residents in texas
__label__0 spain agreed on the condition that the resettled people convert to roman catholicism
__label__0 outraged  edwards and a small party of men took prisoner the alcalde of nacogdoches
__label__0 the mexican army marched to the town  and edwards and his troop then declared the formation of the republic of fredonia between the sabine and rio grande rivers
__label__0 to demonstrate loyalty to their adopted country  a force led by stephen austin hastened to nacogdoches to support the mexican army
__label__0 the united states had no way of knowing that part of the land about to be ceded by mexico had just become far more valuable than anyone could have imagined
__label__0 on january     james marshall discovered gold in the millrace of the sawmill he had built with his partner john sutter on the south fork of california s american river
__label__0 word quickly spread  and within a few weeks all of sutter s employees had left to search for gold
__label__0 the s were a particularly active time in the creation and reorganization of political parties and constituencies  mainly because of discontent with the positions of the mainstream whig and democratic parties in regard to slavery and its extension into the territories
__label__0 the first new party  the small and politically weak liberty party founded in   was a single  issue party  as were many of those that followed it
__label__0 its members were abolitionists who fervently believed slavery was evil and should be ended  and that this was best accomplished by political means
__label__0 in the minds of its members and many other northerners of the time  southern slaveholders had marshaled their wealth and power to control national politics for the purpose of protecting the institution of slavery and extending it into the territories
__label__1 many in the free  soil party believed in this far  reaching conspiracy of the slaveholding elite to control both foreign affairs and domestic policies for their own ends  a cabal that came to be known as the slave power
__label__0 by   the region was producing two  thirds of the world s cotton
__label__1 in   eli whitney revolutionized the production of cotton when he invented the cotton gin  a device that separated the seeds from raw cotton
__label__0 suddenly  a process that was extraordinarily labor  intensive when done by hand could be completed quickly and easily
__label__1 southern whites frequently relied upon the idea of paternalism  the premise that white slaveholders acted in the best interests of slaves  taking responsibility for their care  feeding  discipline  and even their christian morality  to justify the existence of slavery
__label__0 this grossly misrepresented the reality of slavery  which was  by any measure  a dehumanizing  traumatizing  and horrifying human disaster and crime against humanity
__label__0 the north also produced defenders of slavery  including louis agassiz  a harvard professor of zoology and geology
__label__1 agassiz helped to popularize polygenism  the idea that different human races came from separate origins
__label__0 according to this formulation  no single human family origin existed  and blacks made up a race wholly separate from the white race
__label__1 the reform efforts of the antebellum era sprang from the protestant revival fervor that found expression in what historians refer to as the second great awakening
__label__0 the first great awakening of evangelical protestantism had taken place in the s and s
__label__0 beginning in the s  a new intellectual movement known as transcendentalism began to grow in the northeast
__label__1 in this context  to transcend means to go beyond the ordinary sensory world to grasp personal insights and gain appreciation of a deeper reality  and transcendentalists believed that all people could attain an understanding of the world that surpassed rational  sensory experience
__label__0 the shakers provide another example of a community established with a religious mission
__label__0 the shakers started in england as an outgrowth of the quaker religion in the middle of the eighteenth century
__label__0 thereafter  most temperance societies advocated total abstinence  no longer would beer and wine be tolerated
__label__1 such total abstinence from alcohol is known as teetotalism
__label__0 during the early nineteenth century  reformers also interested themselves in the workings of the mind in an effort to better understand the effects of a rapidly changing world awash with religious revivals and democratic movements
__label__1 phrenology  the mapping of the cranium to specific human attributes  stands as an early type of science  related to what would become psychology and devoted to understanding how the mind worked
__label__0 phrenologists believed that the mind contained thirty  seven  faculties   the strengths or weaknesses of which could be determined by a close examination of the size and shape of the cranium   link
__label__0 they rejected colonization as a racist scheme and opposed the use of violence to end slavery
__label__1 influenced by evangelical protestantism  garrison and other abolitionists believed in moral suasion  a technique of appealing to the conscience of the public  especially slaveholders
__label__0 moral suasion relied on dramatic narratives  often from former slaves  about the horrors of slavery  arguing that slavery destroyed families  as children were sold and taken away from their mothers and fathers   link
__label__0 the issue of what to do with the western territories added to the republic by the mexican cession consumed congress in
__label__0 other controversial matters  which had been simmering over time  complicated the problem further
__label__0 as these different factions were agitating for the settlement of kansas and nebraska  leaders of the democratic party in  and  sought to bind their party together in the aftermath of intraparty fights over the distribution of patronage jobs
__label__0 illinois democratic senator stephen douglas believed he had found a solution  the kansas  nebraska bill  that would promote party unity and also satisfy his colleagues from the south  who detested the missouri compromise line
__label__0 in january   douglas introduced the bill   link
__label__0 the events in kansas served as an extreme reply to douglas s proposition of popular sovereignty
__label__0 as the violent clashes increased  kansas became known as  bleeding kansas   antislavery advocates  use of force carved out a new direction for some who opposed slavery
__label__0 distancing themselves from william lloyd garrison and other pacifists  brown and fellow abolitionists believed the time had come to fight slavery with violence
__label__1 douglas portrayed the republican party as an abolitionist effort  one that aimed to bring about miscegenation  or race  mixing through sexual relations or marriage
__label__0 the  black republicans   douglas declared  posed a dangerous threat to the constitution
__label__0 in october   the radical abolitionist john brown and eighteen armed men  both blacks and whites  attacked the federal arsenal in harpers ferry  virginia
__label__0 they hoped to capture the weapons there and distribute them among slaves to begin a massive uprising that would bring an end to slavery
__label__0 indeed  by the time of the corwin amendment s passage through congress  confederate forces in the deep south had already begun to take over federal forts
__label__0 the loss of fort sumter  in the harbor of charleston  south carolina  proved to be the flashpoint in the contest between the new confederacy and the federal government
__label__0 a small union garrison of fewer than one hundred soldiers and officers held the fort  making it a vulnerable target for the confederacy
__label__0 general george b mcclellan  the general in chief of the army  responsible for overall control of union land forces  proved especially reluctant to engage in battle with the confederates
__label__0 in direct command of the army of the potomac  the union fighting force operating outside washington  dc  mcclellan believed  incorrectly  that confederate forces were too strong to defeat and was reluctant to risk his troops in battle
__label__0 his cautious nature made him popular with his men but not with the president or congress
__label__1 by late   the course of the war had changed to take on the characteristics of total war  in which armies attempt to demoralize the enemy by both striking military targets and disrupting their opponent s ability to wage war through destruction of their resources

__label__0 radical republicans insisted on harsh terms for the defeated confederacy and protection for former slaves  going far beyond what the president proposed
__label__0 however  they faced the wrath of defeated but un  reconciled southerners who were determined to keep blacks an impoverished and despised underclass
__label__0 recognizing the widespread devastation in the south and the dire situation of freed people  congress created the bureau of refugees  freedmen  and abandoned lands in march   popularly known as the freedmen s bureau

__label__0 congress also passed a series of three laws designed to stamp out the klan
__label__1 passed in  and   the enforcement acts or  force acts  were designed to outlaw intimidation at the polls and to give the federal government the power to prosecute crimes against freed people in federal rather than state courts
__label__0 congress believed that this last step  a provision in the third enforcement act  also called the ku klux klan act  was necessary in order to ensure that trials would not be decided by white juries in southern states friendly to the klan
__label__0 the concept of manifest destiny found its roots in the long  standing traditions of territorial expansion upon which the nation itself was founded
__label__1 this phrase  which implies divine encouragement for territorial expansion  was coined by magazine editor john osullivan in   when he wrote in the united states magazine and democratic review that  it was our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by providence for the free development of our multiplying millions

__label__0 urbanization occurred rapidly in the second half of the nineteenth century in the united states for a number of reasons
__label__0 the new technologies of the time led to a massive leap in industrialization  requiring large numbers of workers
__label__0 the primary form of relief for working  class urban americans  and particularly immigrants  came in the form of machine politics
__label__1 this phrase referred to the process by which every citizen of the city  no matter their ethnicity or race  was a ward resident with an alderman who spoke on their behalf at city hall
__label__0 these included more expensive excursions  such as vacations in newport  rhode island  winter relocation to sunny florida  and frequent trips aboard steamships to europe
__label__0 for those who were not of the highly respected  old money   but only recently obtained their riches through business ventures  the relief they sought came in the form of one book  the annual social register

__label__0 between the end of the civil war and the beginning of the great depression  nearly two million african americans fled the rural south to seek new opportunities elsewhere

__label__0 this latter choice is often described as the  guns versus butter  debate
__label__0 international agreements represent another of the broad  based foreign policy instruments

__label__1 executive agreements are negotiated by the president  and in the case of sole executive agreements  they are simultaneously approved by the president as well
__label__1 on the other hand  congressional  executive agreements  like the north american free trade agreement  nafta   are negotiated by the president and then approved by a simple majority of the house and senate  rather than a two  thirds vote in the senate as is the case for a treaty
__label__1 in the key case of united states v pink     the supreme court ruled that executive agreements were legally equivalent to treaties provided they did not alter federal law
__label__0 united states v pink   us
__label__0 most executive agreements are not of major importance and do not spark controversy  while some  like the iran nuclear agreement  generate considerable debate

__label__0 while there has sometimes been criticism  congress has never acted to reverse presidential action
__label__0 as discussed above  the war powers resolution clarified that the first step in the use of force was the president s  for the first sixty days
__label__1 a recent example of the military use of force was the us role in enforcing a no  fly zone over libya in   which included kinetic strikes  or active engagement of the enemy  to protect anti  government forces on the ground
__label__0 this dual domestic and international role has been described by the two presidencies thesis
__label__0 this theory originated with university of california  berkeley professor aaron wildavsky and suggests that there are two distinct presidencies  one for foreign policy and one for domestic policy  and that presidents are more successful in foreign than domestic policy
__label__0 let s look at the reasoning behind this thesis
__label__0 while the president still has stronger foreign policy powers than domestic powers  the governing context has changed in two key ways
__label__0 first  the cold war ended in  with the demolition of the berlin wall  the subsequent disintegration of the soviet union  and the eventual opening up of eastern european territories to independence and democracy
__label__0 these dramatic changes removed the competitive superpower aspect of the cold war  in which the united states and the ussr were dueling rivals on the world stage
__label__0 the white house staff members engaged in foreign policy are likely to have very regular contact with the president about their work

__label__0 the end of the cold war opened up old wounds as a variety of smaller european countries sought independence and old ethnic conflicts reappeared
__label__0 some in the united states felt the country should again be isolationist as the world settled into a new political arrangement  including a vocal senator  jesse helms  r  nc   who was against the united states continuing to be the military  policeman  of the world
__label__0 at the other end of the spectrum is liberal internationalism
__label__1 liberal internationalism advocates a foreign policy approach in which the united states becomes proactively engaged in world affairs
__label__0 two particular events in foreign policy caused many to change their views about the proper approach to us involvement in world affairs
__label__0 first  the debacle of us involvement in the civil war in vietnam in the years leading up to  caused many to rethink the country s traditional containment approach to the cold war
__label__0 containment was the us foreign policy goal of limiting the spread of communism
__label__0 foreign markets beckon  tourism helps spur economic development at home and abroad  and global environmental challenges require cross  national conversation
__label__1 in the twenty  first century  neo  isolationism means distancing the united states from the united nations and other international organizations that get in the way
__label__1 the strategy of selective engagement  retaining a strong military presence and remaining engaged across the world through alliances and formal installations  is used to protect the national security interests of the united states
__label__0 with freedoms can come conflict  and there has been much of that in these fledgling countries as opposition coalitions debate how the future course should be charted  and by whom
__label__0 under president vladimir putin  russia is again trying to strengthen its power on the country s western border  testing expansionism while invoking russian nationalism

__label__0 new organizations promoting lgbt rights that emerged after stonewall were more radical and confrontational than the mattachine society and the daughters of bilitis had been

__label__1 in   the rehabilitation act made it illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities in federal employment or in programs run by federal agencies or receiving federal funding
__label__1 this was followed by the education for all handicapped children act of   which required public schools to educate children with disabilities

__label__0 with the advent of video technology and cable television  the power of the president to reach huge audiences increased exponentially
__label__0 president ronald reagan  shown here giving one of his most famous speeches in berlin  was an expert at using technology to help mold and project his presidential image to the public
__label__0 his training as an actor certainly helped in this regard
__label__0 eleanor roosevelt took an active role in championing civil rights  becoming in some ways a bridge between her husband and the civil rights movement
__label__0 she coordinated meetings between fdr and members of the naacp  championed antilynching legislation  openly defied segregation laws  and pushed the army nurse corps to allow black women in its ranks
__label__0 betty ford took over as first lady in  and became an avid advocate of women s rights  proclaiming that she was pro  choice when it came to abortion and lobbying for the ratification of the equal rights amendment  era
__label__0 she shared with the public the news of her breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent mastectomy
__label__0 the increasing public political role of the first lady continued in the s with nancy reagan s  just say no  antidrug campaign and in the early s with barbara bush s efforts on behalf of literacy
__label__0 the public role of the first lady reach a new level with hillary clinton in the s when her husband put her in charge of his efforts to achieve health care reform  a controversial decision that did not meet with political success
__label__0 her successors  laura bush in the first decade of the twenty  first century and michelle obama in the second  returned to the roles played by predecessors in advocating less controversial policies  laura bush advocated literacy and education  while michelle obama has emphasized physical fitness and healthy diet and exercise
__label__0 shortly after taking office  clinton appointed the first lady to chair the task force on national health care reform
__label__0 this organization was to follow through on his campaign promise to fix the problems in the us healthcare system
__label__0 presidents may choose to issue executive orders or proclamations to achieve policy goals
__label__0 usually  executive orders direct government agencies to pursue a certain course in the absence of congressional action
__label__0 but at least one japanese american refused to go along
__label__0 his name was fred korematsu  and he decided to go into hiding in california rather than be taken to the internment camps with his family
__label__0 he was soon discovered  turned over to the military  and sent to the internment camp in utah that held his family
__label__0 presidents also issue executive agreements with foreign powers
__label__0 executive agreements are formal agreements negotiated between two countries but not ratified by a legislature as a treaty must be
__label__0 theodore and franklin d roosevelt offered models of vigorous executive leadership  while the image and style of john f kennedy and ronald reagan influenced and at times haunted or frustrated successors
__label__0 nor is this impact limited to chief executives deemed successful  lyndon johnson s vietnam and richard nixon s watergate offered cautionary tales of presidential power gone wrong  leaving behind legacies that include terms like vietnam syndrome and the tendency to add the suffix  gate  to scandals and controversies
__label__0 the youth and glamour that john f kennedy and first lady jacqueline brought to the white house in the early s  a  helped give rise to the legend of  one brief shining moment that was camelot  after kennedy s presidency was cut short by his assassination on november

__label__0 under the articles of confederation  there was no national judiciary
__label__0 the us constitution changed that  but its article iii  which addresses  the judicial power of the united states   is the shortest and least detailed of the three articles that created the branches of government
__label__0 it calls for the creation of  one supreme court  and establishes the court s jurisdiction  or its authority to hear cases and make decisions about them  and the types of cases the court may hear
__label__0 it was not until the court s th year of operation that congress  at the urging of chief justice  and former president  william howard taft  provided the designation and funding for the supreme court s own building   on a scale in keeping with the importance and dignity of the court and the judiciary as a coequal  independent branch of the federal government

__label__0 the supreme court found itself in the middle of a dispute between the outgoing presidential administration of john adams and that of incoming president  and opposition party member  thomas jefferson
__label__0 it was an interesting circumstance at the time  particularly because jefferson and the man who would decide the case  john marshall  were themselves political rivals
__label__0 even with judicial review in place  the courts do not always stand ready just to throw out actions of the other branches of government
__label__0 more broadly  as marshall put it   it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is
__label__0 marbury v madison   us
__label__0 the united states has a common law system in which law is largely developed through binding judicial decisions
__label__0 with roots in medieval england  the system was inherited by the american colonies along with many other british traditions
__label__0 the common law and civil law traditions   the robbins collection
__label__0 since this  decision  the aca has continued to face challenges  the most notable of which have also been decided by court rulings
__label__0 it faced a setback in   for instance  when the supreme court ruled in burwell v hobby lobby that  for religious reasons  some for  profit corporations could be exempt from the requirement that employers provide insurance coverage of contraceptives for their female employees
__label__0 burwell v hobby lobby   us
__label__0 but the aca also attained a victory in king v burwell  when the court upheld the ability of the federal government to provide tax credits for people who bought their health insurance through an exchange created by the law
__label__0 king v burwell   us
__label__0 her interviewer recommended her based on her qualifications  but she was never given the job because the clothing retailer wanted to avoid having to accommodate her religious practice of wearing a headscarf  or hijab

__label__0 equal employment opportunity commission v abercrombie  fitch stores   us
__label__0 even without unanimous agreement among citizens  supreme court decisions have made all these possibilities a reality  a particularly important one for the individuals who become the beneficiaries   link
__label__0 the judicial branch has often made decisions the other branches were either unwilling or unable to make  and hamilton was right in federalist no  when he said that without the courts exercising their duty to defend the constitution   all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing
__label__0 each of the thirteen colonies had also had its own courts  based on the british common law model
__label__0 the judiciary today continues as a dual court system  with courts at both the national and state levels
__label__0 both levels have three basic tiers consisting of trial courts  appellate courts  and finally courts of last resort  typically called supreme courts  at the top   link
__label__0 crimes are usually labeled felonies or misdemeanors based on their nature and seriousness  felonies are the more serious crimes
__label__0 when someone commits a criminal act  the government  state or national  depending on which law has been broken  charges that person with a crime  and the case brought to court contains the name of the charging government  as in miranda v arizona discussed below
__label__0 miranda v arizona   us
__label__0 on the other hand  civil law cases involve two or more private  non  government  parties  at least one of whom alleges harm or injury committed by the other
__label__0 in both criminal and civil matters  the courts decide the remedy and resolution of the case  and in all cases  the us supreme court is the final court of appeal

__label__0 each court is overseen by a rotating panel of three judges who do not hold trials but instead review the rulings of the trial  district  courts within their geographic circuit
__label__0 gradually over the next hundred years  congress expanded their jurisdiction  in particular over federal questions  which enables them to review constitutional issues and matters of federal law

__label__0 interest groups in particular can become heavily involved in trying to influence the judiciary by filing amicus briefs  both before and after a case has been granted cert
__label__0 when oral arguments have been concluded  the justices have to decide the case  and they do so in conference  which is held in private twice a week when the court is in session and once a week when it is not
__label__0 the conference is also a time to discuss petitions for certiorari  but for those cases already heard  each justice may state his or her views on the case  ask questions  or raise concerns
__label__0 likewise  the most senior justice in the dissenting group can assign a member of that group to write the dissenting opinion  however  any justice who disagrees with the majority may write a separate dissenting opinion
__label__0 if a justice agrees with the outcome of the case but not with the majority s reasoning in it  that justice may write a concurring opinion
__label__0 a judge or justice who views the role with an activist lens is more likely to use his or her judicial power to broaden personal liberty  justice  and equality
__label__0 still others believe in judicial restraint  which leads them to defer decisions  and thus policymaking  to the elected branches of government and stay focused on a narrower interpretation of the bill of rights
__label__0 these justices are less likely to strike down actions or laws as unconstitutional and are less likely to focus on the expansion of individual liberties
__label__0 at some point  if you have nt already been called  you may receive a summons for jury duty from your local court system
__label__0 you may be asked to serve on federal jury duty  such as us district court duty or federal grand jury duty  but service at the local level  in the state court system  is much more common
__label__0 while it is true that courts play a major role in policymaking  they have no mechanism to make their rulings a reality
__label__0 remember it was alexander hamilton in federalist no  who remarked that the courts had  neither force nor will  but merely judgment
__label__0 and even years later  when the  supreme court ruled the state of georgia s seizing of native american lands unconstitutional  worcester v georgia   us   pet
__label__0 httpwwwpbsorgwnetsupremecourtantebellumhistoryhtml  march
__label__0 abraham lincoln  too  famously ignored chief justice roger b taney s order finding unconstitutional lincoln s suspension of habeas corpus rights in   early in the civil war
__label__0 thus  court rulings matter only to the extent they are heeded and followed
__label__0 before the ratification of the constitution  the state governments  power far exceeded that held by the national government
__label__0 this distribution of authority was the result of a conscious decision and was reflected in the structure and framework of the articles of confederation
__label__0 the national government was limited  lacking both a president to oversee domestic and foreign policy and a system of federal courts to settle disputes between the states
__label__0 the constitution allocated more power to the federal government by effectively adding two new branches  a president to head the executive branch and the supreme court to head the judicial branch
__label__0 the specific delegated or expressed powers granted to congress and to the president were clearly spelled out in the body of the constitution under article i  section   and article ii  sections  and
__label__0 however  this result was not without its critics
__label__0 initially  the supreme court overturned several key legislative proposals passed under roosevelt  reasoning that they represented an overreach of presidential authority and were unconstitutional  such as schechter poultry corp v united states
__label__0 a l a schechter poultry corp v united states   us
__label__0 eventually  however  the supreme court shifted direction to reflect public opinion  which was decisively behind the president and the need for government intervention in a time of economic turmoil

__label__0 these requests from the federal government are referred to as unfunded mandates and are a source of dissatisfaction to political actors at the state and local level
__label__1 to provide more transparency to state and local governments and reduce the federal government s use of mandates  the unfunded mandates reform act was passed in
__label__0 this act requires the congressional budget office to provide information about the cost of any proposed government mandate that exceeds a specified threshold before the bill can be considered in congress
__label__0 philip joyce   is the era of unfunded federal mandates over   governing   april   httpwwwgoverningcomcolumnssmartmgmtcoliseraunfundedfederalmandatesoverhtml
__label__0 dillon s rule is from mars  home rule is from venus  local government autonomy and the rules of statutory construction   publius   no
__label__0 this added independence is called home rule  and the transfer of power is typically spelled out within a charter
__label__1 charters are similar to state constitutions  they provide a framework and a detailed accounting of local government responsibilities and areas of authority
__label__0 states that align with elazar s individualistic political culture see the government as a mechanism for addressing issues that matter to individual citizens and for pursuing individual goals
__label__0 people in this culture interact with the government in the same manner they would interact with a marketplace
__label__0 given the prominence of slavery in its formation  a traditionalistic political culture  in elazar s argument  sees the government as necessary to maintaining the existing social order  the status quo
__label__0 only elites belong in the political enterprise  and as a result  new public policies will be advanced only if they reinforce the beliefs and interests of those in power
__label__0 anyone elected to the office of governor assumes tremendous responsibility overnight
__label__0 he or she becomes the spokesperson for the entire state and their political party  accepts blame or praise for handling decision  making in times of crisis  oversees the implementation of public policy  and helps shepherd legislation through the lawmaking process
__label__0 having introduced his or her priorities  the governor will work on the sidelines to steer favored bills through the legislative process
__label__0 this may entail holding meetings with committee chairs or other influential lawmakers concerning their legislative priorities  working with the media to try to get favorable coverage of legislative priorities  targeting advocacy organizations to maintain pressure on resistant lawmakers  or testifying in legislative hearings about the possible impacts of the legislation
__label__0 governors  powers and authority   httpwwwngaorgcmshomemanagementresourcesgovernorspowersandauthorityhtml  march
__label__0 the line  item veto gives governors the ability to strike out a line or individual portions of a bill while letting the remainder pass into law
__label__0 in addition  approximately  percent of governors have the power of an amendatory veto  which allows them to send a bill back to the legislature and request a specific amendment to it
__label__0 finally  a small number of governors  including the governor of texas  also have the power of a reduction veto  which allows them to reduce the budget proposed in a piece of legislation
__label__0 national conference of state legislatures
__label__0 for example  texas governor greg abbott made headlines in  for writing to the ceo of general electric  ge   urging the company to relocate its corporate headquarters from connecticut  which had just raised its corporate tax rate  to texas
__label__0 patrick svitek   abbott tries wooing general electric to texas   the texas tribune   june   httpswwwtexastribuneorgabbottlookswoogeneralelectricconnecticut
__label__0 as his state s spokesperson  abbott promoted texas s friendly corporate tax structure and investment in transportation and education funding in hopes of enticing ge to relocate there and bring economic opportunities with it
__label__0 the company has since decided to relocate to boston  after receiving incentives  worth up to   million  from massachusetts officials

__label__0 another example involved texas governor rick perry touring california in  in order to bring prospective businesses from the golden state to texas
__label__0 if severe winter weather is forecasted or in the event of civil unrest  governors also have the power to call upon the national guard to assist residents and first responders or aid in storm recovery   link
__label__0 when governors declare a state of emergency  national guard troops can be activated to go into local areas and assist with emergency efforts in whatever capacity they are needed
__label__0 susan gardner   baltimore erupts into chaos  governor activates national guard    april   httpwwwdailykoscomstorybaltimoreeruptsintochaosgovernoractivatesnationalguard

__label__0 despite the tremendous formal powers that go with the job  being governor is still personally and professionally challenging
__label__0 the demands of the job are likely to restrict time with family and require forgoing privacy

__label__0 the most common form of county government is the commission system
__label__0 under this structure  an elected commission  which generally consists of a small number of commissioners  serves as the governing body within the county  performing all legislative and executive functions
__label__0 municipal governments oversee the operation and functions of cities and towns
__label__0 census estimates for  show just over  municipal governments and nearly  township governments in the united states
__label__0 lavin   census bureau reports there are  local governments in the united states  cb
__label__0 the vast majority of municipal governments operate on one of two governing models  a mayor  council system or a council  manager system
__label__0 collectively  these essential workers are called the bureaucracy
__label__1 a bureaucracy is an administrative group of nonelected officials charged with carrying out functions connected to a series of policies and programs
__label__0 in the united states  the bureaucracy began as a very small collection of individuals
__label__0 
__label__0 eventually  after president james garfield had been assassinated by a disappointed office seeker   link    congress responded to cries for reform with the pendleton act  also called the civil service reform act of
__label__1 the act established the civil service commission  a centralized agency charged with ensuring that the federal government s selection  retention  and promotion practices were based on open  competitive examinations in a merit system
__label__0 for more on the pendleton act and its effects see sean m theriault
__label__0 when the republican president and congress were not seen as moving aggressively enough to fix the situation  the democrats won the  election in overwhelming fashion
__label__0 president franklin d roosevelt and the us congress rapidly reorganized the government s problem  solving efforts into a series of programs designed to revive the economy  stimulate economic development  and generate employment opportunities
__label__0 in the s  the federal bureaucracy grew with the addition of the federal deposit insurance corporation to protect and regulate us banking  the national labor relations board to regulate the way companies could treat their workers  the securities and exchange commission to regulate the stock market  and the civil aeronautics board to regulate air travel
__label__0 all of these new programs required bureaucrats to run them  and the national bureaucracy naturally ballooned
__label__0 its size became a rallying cry for conservatives  who eventually elected ronald reagan president for the express purpose of reducing the bureaucracy
__label__0 while reagan was able to work with congress to reduce some aspects of the federal bureaucracy  he contributed to its expansion in other ways  particularly in his efforts to fight the cold war
__label__0 for more on lbj and the great society see  john a andrew
__label__0 second  the law raised the qualifications for employment in civil service positions by requiring applicants to pass exams designed to test their competence in a number of important skill and knowledge areas
__label__0 third  it allowed for the creation of the united states civil service commission  csc   which was charged with enforcing the elements of the law  united states civil service commission
__label__0 
__label__0 congress and the president responded with the civil service reform act of   which abolished the civil service commission
__label__0 in its place  the law created two new federal agencies  the office of personnel management  opm  and the merit systems protection board  mspb
__label__1 the opm has responsibility for recruiting  interviewing  and testing potential government employees in order to choose those who should be hired
__label__0 later sociologists have not always looked so favorably upon bureaucracies  and they have developed alternate models to explain how and why bureaucracies function
__label__0 one such model is called the acquisitive model of bureaucracy
__label__1 the acquisitive model proposes that bureaucracies are naturally competitive and power  hungry
__label__1 agencies formed by the federal government to administer a quasi  business enterprise are called government corporations
__label__0 they exist because the services they provide are partly subject to market forces and tend to generate enough profit to be self  sustaining  but they also fulfill a vital service the government has an interest in maintaining
__label__0 once the particulars of implementation have been spelled out in the legislation authorizing a new program  bureaucracies move to enact it
__label__0 when they encounter grey areas  many follow the federal negotiated rulemaking process to propose a solution  that is  detailing how particular new federal polices  regulations  andor programs will be implemented in the agencies
__label__0 congress can not possibly legislate on that level of detail  so the experts in the bureaucracy do so
__label__0 perhaps congress s most powerful oversight tool is the government accountability office  gao   httpwwwgaogov  may
__label__1 the gao is an agency that provides congress  its committees  and the heads of the executive agencies with auditing  evaluation  and investigative services
__label__0 it is designed to operate in a fact  based and nonpartisan manner to deliver important oversight information where and when it is needed
__label__0 a more extreme  and in many instances  more controversial solution to the perceived and real inefficiencies in the bureaucracy is privatization
__label__0 in the united states  largely because it was born during the enlightenment and has a long history of championing free  market principles  the urge to privatize government services has never been as strong as it is in many other countries
__label__0 on march     both chambers of congress passed the health care and education reconciliation act  hcera

__label__0 for example  much of the debate over gun safety policy in the united states has centered on the unwillingness of congress to act  even in the face of public opinion that supports some changes to gun policy
__label__0 in fact  one of the last major changes occurred in   when lawmakers  inaction resulted in the expiration of a piece of legislation known as the federal assault weapons ban

__label__0 during the great depression of the s  the united states created a set of policies and programs that constituted a social safety net for the millions who had lost their jobs  their homes  and their savings   link
__label__0 under president franklin delano roosevelt  the federal government began programs like the work progress administration and civilian conservation corps to combat unemployment and the home owners  loan corporation to refinance depression  related mortgage debts
__label__0 proponents of free  market economics believe that the market forces of supply and demand  working without any government involvement  are the most effective way for markets to operate
__label__0 one of the basic principles of free  market economics is that for just about any good that can be privatized  the most efficient means for exchange is the marketplace
__label__0 economists consider goods like cable tv  cellphone service  and private schools to be toll goods
__label__1 toll goods are similar to public goods in that they are open to all and theoretically infinite if maintained  but they are paid for or provided by some outside  nongovernment  entity
__label__0 in   theodore lowi argued that it was possible to categorize policy based upon the degree to which costs and benefits were concentrated on the few or diffused across the many
__label__1 one policy category  known as distributive policy  tends to collect payments or resources from many but concentrates direct benefits on relatively few
__label__0 highways are often developed through distributive policy
__label__0 investigative journalists  called muckrakers by politicians and business leaders who were the focus of their investigations  began to expose many of the ways in which manufacturers were abusing the public trust
__label__0 although various forms of corruption topped the list of abuses  among the most famous muckraker exposs was the jungle  a  novel by upton sinclair that focused on unsanitary working conditions and unsavory business practices in the meat  packing industry  upton sinclair

__label__0 the us government began developing a social welfare policy during the great depression of the s
__label__0 by the s  social welfare had become a major function of the federal government  one to which most public policy funds are devoted  and had developed to serve several overlapping functions
__label__0 one of the oldest and largest pieces of social welfare policy is social security  which cost the united states about   billion in  alone
__label__0 an update to the budget and economic outlook   to     august   httpswwwcbogovpublication  march
__label__0 these costs are offset by a  percent payroll tax on all wages up to    employers and workers who are not self  employed split the bill for each worker  whereas the self  employed pay their entire share
__label__0 update    httpswwwssagovpubsenpdf  march
__label__0 social security was conceived as a solution to several problems inherent to the industrial era economy
__label__0 first  by the s and s  an increasing number of workers were earning their living through manual or day  wage labor that depended on their ability to engage in physical activity   link
__label__0 during the george w bush administration  social security became a highly politicized topic as the republican party sought to find a way of preventing what experts predicted would be the impending collapse of the social security system   link
__label__0 in   the ratio of workers paying into the program to beneficiaries receiving payments was  to
__label__0 more than  percent of all health care dollars spent were being spent by the us government well before the aca was enacted
__label__0 as you have already learned  medicare was created decades earlier
__label__0 despite protesters  resistance to government involvement in health care  there is no keeping government out of medicare  the government is medicare
__label__0 a second approach to creating public policy is a bit more objective
__label__0 rather than starting with what ought to happen and seeking ways to make it so  policy analysts try to identify all the possible choices available to a decision maker and then gauge their impacts if implemented
__label__0 the goal of the analyst is nt really to encourage the implementation of any of the options  rather  it is to make sure decision makers are fully informed about the implications of the decisions they do make
__label__0 acid rain provides another nice illustration of agenda setting and the problems and solutions subphases
__label__0 acid rain is a widely recognized problem that did not make it on to the governmental policy agenda until congress passed the air quality act of   long after environmental groups started asking for laws to regulate pollution
__label__0 until the s  most policy advocates argued that the best way for the government to interact with the economy was through a hands  off approach formally known as laissez  faire economics
__label__1 these policymakers believed the key to economic growth and development was the government s allowing private markets to operate efficiently
__label__0 the end of prosperity  how higher taxes will doom the economy
__label__0 new york  simon  schuster
__label__1 they called for an approach known as supply  side economics  which argues that economic growth is largely a function of the productive capacity of a country
__label__0 supply  siders have argued that increased regulation and higher taxes reduce the incentive to invest new money into the economy  to the point where little growth can occur
__label__0 in theory  the amount of revenue raised by the national government should be equal to these expenses  but with the exception of a brief period from  to   that has not been the case
__label__0 the economic recovery from the  recession  and budget control efforts implemented since then  have managed to cut the annual deficit  the amount by which expenditures are greater than revenues  by more than half
__label__0 however  the amount of money the us government needed to borrow to pay its bills in  was still in excess of   billion
__label__0 the federal budget in   an infographic    january   wwwcbogovpublication  march
__label__1 supply  siders  on the other hand  prefer regressive tax systems  which lower the overall rate as individuals make more money
__label__0 this does not automatically mean the wealthy pay less than the poor  simply that the percentage of their income they pay in taxes will be lower
__label__0 if you have read or watched the news for the past several years  perhaps you have heard the names janet yellen  ben bernanke  or alan greenspan
__label__0 bernanke and greenspan are recent past chairs of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  yellen is the current chair   link
__label__0 domestic issues can sometimes become international ones when it comes to such topics as foreign trade
__label__0 here  president george w bush shakes hands with legislators and administration officials after signing the central american free trade agreement  cafta  implementation act on august
__label__0 the payoff of stability that comes from other us foreign policy goals is peace and tranquility
__label__0 while certainly looking out for its own strategic interests in considering foreign policy strategy  the united states nonetheless attempts to support international peace through many aspects of its foreign policy  such as foreign aid  and through its support of and participation in international organizations such as the united nations  the north atlantic treaty organization  nato   and the organization of american states

__label__1 a country is said to be engaging in protectionism when it does not permit other countries to sell goods and services within its borders  or when it charges them very high tariffs  or import taxes  to do so
__label__1 at the other end of the spectrum is a free trade approach  in which a country allows the unfettered flow of goods and services between itself and other countries
__label__0 at times the united states has been free trade  oriented  while at other times it has been protectionist
__label__0 for many  foreign policy is synonymous with diplomacy
__label__1 diplomacy is the establishment and maintenance of a formal relationship between countries that governs their interactions on matters as diverse as tourism  the taxation of goods they trade  and the landing of planes on each other s runways
__label__0 while diplomatic relations are not always rosy  when they are operating it does suggest that things are going well between the countries
__label__0 such war can be offensive  as were the iraq war in  and the  removal of panamanian leader manuel noriega
__label__1 or it can be defensive  as a means to respond to aggression from others  such as the persian gulf war in   also known as operation desert storm   link
__label__1 in shotgun sequencing method  several copies of a dna fragment are cut randomly into many smaller pieces  somewhat like what happens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun
__label__0 all of the segments are then sequenced using the chain  sequencing method
__label__1 dna microarrays are methods used to detect gene expression by analyzing an array of dna fragments that are fixed to a glass slide or a silicon chip to identify active genes and identify sequences
__label__0 almost one million genotypic abnormalities can be discovered using microarrays  whereas whole  genome sequencing can provide information about all six billion base pairs in the human genome
__label__0 metabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics
__label__1 metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism
__label__1 the metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism
__label__1 proteomic approaches are being used to improve screening and early detection of cancer  this is achieved by identifying proteins whose expression is affected by the disease process
__label__0 an individual protein is called a biomarker  whereas a set of proteins with altered expression levels is called a protein signature
__label__0 for a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for early screening and detection of a cancer  it must be secreted in body fluids  such as sweat  blood  or urine  such that large  scale screenings can be performed in a non  invasive fashion
__label__0 darwin called this mechanism natural selection
__label__1 natural selection  also known as  survival of the fittest   is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits  this leads to evolutionary change
__label__0 sometimes  evolution gives rise to groups of organisms that become tremendously different from each other
__label__1 when two species evolve in diverse directions from a common point  it is called divergent evolution
__label__0 such divergent evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs of flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies  however  they can look very different as a result of selection in different physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators   link
__label__0 flowering plants evolved from a common ancestor
__label__1 some structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all  and appear to be residual parts from a past common ancestor
__label__0 these unused structures without function are called vestigial structures
__label__0 other examples of vestigial structures are wings on flightless birds  leaves on some cacti  and hind leg bones in whales
__label__0 for example  even though bald eagles  haliaeetus leucocephalus  and african fish eagles  haliaeetus vocifer  are both birds and eagles  each belongs to a separate species group   link
__label__1 if humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of a bald eagle with the sperm of an african fish eagle and a chick did hatch  that offspring  called a hybrid  a cross between two species   would probably be infertile  unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity
__label__0 different species may have different genes that are active in development  therefore  it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions
__label__1 allopatric speciation  allo
__label__1 sympatric speciation  sym
__label__1 reproductive isolation is the inability to interbreed
__label__1 in some cases  a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition called autopolyploidy   link
__label__1 the prefix  auto  means  self   so the term means multiple chromosomes from one s own species
__label__1 recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg  the first cell of the development of an organism that reproduces sexually
__label__1 therefore  a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place  this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction
__label__0 a postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation  this includes organisms that do nt survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile
__label__1 in some cases  populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the other populations of the same species
__label__0 this situation is called habitat isolation
__label__0 reproduction with the parent species ceases  and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent
__label__1 hybrid individuals in many cases can not form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages
__label__0 this is called hybrid inviability because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable
__label__1 in another postzygotic situation  reproduction leads to the birth and growth of a hybrid that is sterile and unable to reproduce offspring of their own  this is called hybrid sterility
__label__1 heritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to genetic differences  or genetic variance  among individuals in a population
__label__0 the greater the hereditability of a population s phenotypic variation  the more susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation
__label__0 while it is likely to happen at some point  it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population  and as a result  the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool
__label__1 however  if a family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other  this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring  a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression
__label__0 genetic drift can also be magnified by natural events  such as a natural disaster that kills  at random  a large portion of the population
__label__1 known as the bottleneck effect  it results in a large portion of the genome suddenly being wiped out   link
__label__0 in one fell swoop  the genetic structure of the survivors becomes the genetic structure of the entire population  which may be very different from the pre  disaster population
__label__0 traits that lead to more matings for an individual become selected for by natural selection
__label__1 one common form of mate choice  called assortative mating  is an individual s preference to mate with partners who are phenotypically similar to themselves
__label__1 natural selection only acts on the population s heritable traits  selecting for beneficial alleles and thus increasing their frequency in the population  while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their frequency  a process known as adaptive evolution
__label__0 natural selection does not act on individual alleles  however  but on entire organisms
__label__1 if natural selection favors an average phenotype  selecting against extreme variation  the population will undergo stabilizing selection   link
__label__0 in a population of mice that live in the woods  for example  natural selection is likely to favor individuals that best blend in with the forest floor and are less likely to be spotted by predators
__label__1 another type of selection  called frequency  dependent selection  favors phenotypes that are either common  positive frequency  dependent selection  or rare  negative frequency  dependent selection
__label__0 an interesting example of this type of selection is seen in a unique group of lizards of the pacific northwest
__label__1 the good genes hypothesis states that males develop these impressive ornaments to show off their efficient metabolism or their ability to fight disease
__label__0 females then choose males with the most impressive traits because it signals their genetic superiority  which they will then pass on to their offspring
__label__0 scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms
__label__1 a phylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms
__label__0 scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one can not go back to confirm the proposed relationships
__label__1 the point where a split occurs  called a branch point  represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one
__label__1 a lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon
__label__1 when two lineages stem from the same branch point  they are called sister taxa
__label__0 many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time  these disciplines together contribute to building  updating  and maintaining the  tree of life   information is used to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called systematics
__label__0 data may be collected from fossils  from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism  and by dna analysis
__label__1 within each domain is a second category called a kingdom
__label__0 after kingdoms  the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are  phylum  class  order  family  genus  and species   link
__label__0 this usually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions
__label__1 when similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship  it is called an analogy or homoplasy
__label__0 for example  insects use wings to fly like bats and birds  but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely different
__label__1 to aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately  scientists often use a concept called maximum parsimony  which means that events occurred in the simplest  most obvious way
__label__0 for example  if a group of people entered a forest preserve to go hiking  based on the principle of maximum parsimony  one could predict that most of the people would hike on established trails rather than forge new ones
__label__1 the mitochondria  first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host   linkb   which subsequently acquired a nucleus  by fusion or other mechanisms  to become the first eukaryotic cell
__label__1 most interestingly  the eukaryote  first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity   linkc
__label__0 all of these hypotheses are testable
__label__0 virions  single virus particles  are very small  about  nanometers in diameter
__label__1 these individual virus particles are the infectious form of a virus outside the host cell
__label__0 viruses come in many shapes and sizes  but these are consistent and distinct for each viral family
__label__1 all virions have a nucleic acid genome covered by a protective layer of proteins  called a capsid
__label__0 the capsid is made up of protein subunits called capsomeres
__label__1 glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope are used to attach to host cells
__label__1 other envelope proteins are the matrix proteins that stabilize the envelope and often play a role in the assembly of progeny virions
__label__0 chicken pox  influenza  and mumps are examples of diseases caused by viruses with envelopes
__label__0 their mrna is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular dna
__label__1 group ii viruses have single  stranded dna  ssdna  as their genome
__label__0 they convert their single  stranded genomes into a dsdna intermediate before transcription to mrna can occur
__label__1 group iv viruses have ssrna as their genome with a positive polarity
__label__1 positive polarity means that the genomic rna can serve directly as mrna
__label__1 intermediates of dsrna  called replicative intermediates  are made in the process of copying the genomic rna
__label__0 additionally  full  length positive rna strands are made to serve as templates for the production of the negative  stranded genome
__label__1 group vi viruses have diploid  two copies  ssrna genomes that must be converted  using the enzyme reverse transcriptase  to dsdna  the dsdna is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the host genome
__label__1 group vi viruses have diploid  two copies  ssrna genomes that must be converted  using the enzyme reverse transcriptase  to dsdna  the dsdna is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the host genome
__label__0 then  mrna can be produced by transcription of the viral dna that was integrated into the host genome
__label__1 the viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell  which may cause cell damage
__label__0 these changes  called cytopathic  causing cell damage  effects  can change cell functions or even destroy the cell
__label__1 some infected cells  such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus  die through lysis  bursting  or apoptosis  programmed cell death or  cell suicide    releasing all progeny virions at once
__label__1 when infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions  the infection is said to be productive
__label__0 if the virions are released by bursting the cell  the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle   link
__label__0 an example of a lytic bacteriophage is t  which infects escherichia coli found in the human intestinal tract
__label__0 an example is the animal herpesviruses  including herpes simplex viruses  the cause of oral and genital herpes in humans
__label__1 in a process called latency  these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing new virions  only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates
__label__0 even though there are similarities between lysogeny and latency  the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages
__label__0 examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza
__label__0 other viruses cause long  term chronic infections  such as the virus causing hepatitis c  whereas others  like herpes simplex virus  only cause intermittent symptoms
__label__1 still other viruses  such as human herpesviruses  and   which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola  often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host  and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection
__label__1 plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors  through contact with an infected plant s sap  by living organisms such as insects and nematodes  and through pollen
__label__1 when plants viruses are transferred between different plants  this is known as horizontal transmission  and when they are inherited from a parent  this is called vertical transmission
__label__0 symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host   link
__label__1 one common symptom is hyperplasia  the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls
__label__1 one common symptom is hyperplasia  the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls
__label__0 the danger of using live vaccines  which are usually more effective than killed vaccines  is the low but significant danger that these viruses will revert to their disease  causing form by back mutations
__label__1 live vaccines are usually made by attenuating  weakening  the  wild  type   disease  causing  virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host
__label__1 live vaccines are usually made by attenuating  weakening  the  wild  type   disease  causing  virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host
__label__0 adaptations to these new cells or temperatures induce mutations in the genomes of the virus  allowing it to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting its ability to cause disease when reintroduced into conditions found in the host
__label__0 the use of bacteriophages specific for such bacteria would bypass their resistance to antibiotics and specifically kill them
__label__0 although phage therapy is in use in the republic of georgia to treat antibiotic  resistant bacteria  its use to treat human diseases has not been approved in most countries
__label__0 however  the safety of the treatment was confirmed in the united states when the us food and drug administration approved spraying meats with bacteriophages to destroy the food pathogen listeria
__label__0 as more and more antibiotic  resistant strains of bacteria evolve  the use of bacteriophages might be a potential solution to the problem  and the development of phage therapy is of much interest to researchers worldwide
__label__0 it is this variant that constitutes the prion particle
__label__0 prp exists in two forms  prpc  the normal form of the protein  and prpsc  the infectious form
__label__1 prp exists in two forms  prpc  the normal form of the protein  and prpsc  the infectious form
__label__0 once introduced into the body  the prpsc contained within the prion binds to prpc and converts it to prpsc
__label__0 microbial mats or large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of life on earth  there is fossil evidence of their presence starting about  billion years ago
__label__1 a microbial mat is a multi  layered sheet of prokaryotes   link   that includes mostly bacteria  but also archaea
__label__0 microbial mats are a few centimeters thick  and they typically grow where different types of materials interface  mostly on moist surfaces
__label__1 autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs  and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of earth
__label__0 then  cyanobacteria  also known as blue  green algae  evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later
__label__1 cyanobacteria   link   began the oxygenation of the atmosphere
__label__0 in other cases  culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions  even though the same organism could be cultured previously
__label__1 those organisms that can not be cultured but are not dead are in a viable  but  non  culturable  vbnc  state
__label__0 the vbnc state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental stressors by entering a dormant state that allows their survival
__label__1 the cell wall functions as a protective layer  and it is responsible for the organism s shape
__label__0 some bacteria have an outer capsule outside the cell wall
__label__0 other structures are present in some prokaryotic species  but not in others   link
__label__0 there are more than  different forms of peptidoglycan
__label__1 s  layer  surface layer  proteins are also present on the outside of cell walls of both archaea and bacteria
__label__0 there are four different types of archaean cell walls
__label__1 one type is composed of pseudopeptidoglycan  which is similar to peptidoglycan in morphology but contains different sugars in the polysaccharide chain
__label__0 the other three types of cell walls are composed of polysaccharides  glycoproteins  or pure protein
__label__1 gaseous nitrogen is transformed  or  fixed  into more readily available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen fixation
__label__0 ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms
__label__1 another source of ammonia is ammonification  the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen  containing organic compounds
__label__0 ammonia released to the atmosphere  however  represents only  percent of the total nitrogen released  the rest is as n and no
__label__1 epidemiologists study how diseases affect a population
__label__1 an epidemic is a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time
__label__1 a pandemic is a widespread  usually worldwide  epidemic
__label__0 one of the most devastating pandemics was the black death   to   that is believed to have been another outbreak of bubonic plague caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis
__label__0 it is thought to have originated initially in china and spread along the silk road  a network of land and sea trade routes  to the mediterranean region and europe  carried by rat fleas living on black rats that were always present on ships
__label__0 the word antibiotic comes from the greek anti meaning  against  and bios meaning  life
__label__1 an antibiotic is a chemical  produced either by microbes or synthetically  that is hostile to the growth of other organisms
__label__0 today s news and media often address concerns about an antibiotic crisis
__label__0 outbreaks of bacterial infection related to food consumption are common
__label__1 a foodborne disease  colloquially called  food poisoning   is an illness resulting from the consumption the pathogenic bacteria  viruses  or other parasites that contaminate food
__label__0 although the united states has one of the safest food supplies in the world  the us centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  has reported that   million people get sick  more than  are hospitalized  and  americans die each year from foodborne illness
__label__0 the characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time
__label__1 biological nitrogen fixation  bnf  is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes  soil bacteria  cyanobacteria  and frankia spp
__label__0 filamentous bacteria interacting with actinorhizal plants such as alder  bayberry  and sweet fern
__label__1 microbial bioremediation is the use of prokaryotes  or microbial metabolism  to remove pollutants
__label__0 bioremediation has been used to remove agricultural chemicals  pesticides  fertilizers  that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface
__label__0 some groups of eukaryotes are photosynthetic
__label__0 their cells contain  in addition to the standard eukaryotic organelles  another kind of organelle called a plastid
__label__1 when such cells are carrying out photosynthesis  their plastids are rich in the pigment chlorophyll a and a range of other pigments  called accessory pigments  which are involved in harvesting energy from light
__label__1 subtypes of heterotrophs  called saprobes  absorb nutrients from dead organisms or their organic wastes
__label__1 some protists can function as mixotrophs  obtaining nutrition by photoautotrophic or heterotrophic routes  depending on whether sunlight or organic nutrients are available
__label__0 the human parasite  trypanosoma brucei  belongs to a different subgroup of euglenozoa  the kinetoplastids
__label__1 the kinetoplastid subgroup is named after the kinetoplast  a dna mass carried within the single  oversized mitochondrion possessed by each of these cells
__label__1 this subgroup includes several parasites  collectively called trypanosomes  which cause devastating human diseases and infect an insect species during a portion of their life cycle
__label__1 waste particles are expelled by an exocytic vesicle that fuses at a specific region on the cell membrane  called the anal pore
__label__1 in addition to a vacuole  based digestive system  paramecium also uses contractile vacuoles  which are osmoregulatory vesicles that fill with water as it enters the cell by osmosis and then contract to squeeze water from the cell
__label__0 the protist then transports its cytoplasm into the pseudopod  thereby moving the entire cell
__label__1 this type of motion  called cytoplasmic streaming  is used by several diverse groups of protists as a means of locomotion or as a method to distribute nutrients and oxygen
__label__0 for example most terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi
__label__1 the roots of the plant connect with the underground parts of the fungus forming mycorrhizae
__label__1 through mycorrhizae  the fungus and plant exchange nutrients and water  greatly aiding the survival of both species alternatively  lichens are an association between a fungus and its photosynthetic partner  usually an alga
__label__1 dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular to multicellular state depending on environmental conditions
__label__1 unicellular fungi are generally referred to as yeasts
__label__1 saccharomyces cerevisiae  baker s yeast  and candida species  the agents of thrush  a common fungal infection  are examples of unicellular fungi   link
__label__1 most fungal hyphae are divided into separate cells by endwalls called septa  singular  septum    link  a  c
__label__0 in most phyla of fungi  tiny holes in the septa allow for the rapid flow of nutrients and small molecules from cell to cell along the hypha
__label__1 most fungi are obligate aerobes  requiring oxygen to survive
__label__1 other species  such as the chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle  are are obligate anaerobes  in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them
__label__0 yeasts are intermediate  being faculative anaerobes
__label__0 the rings swell when they touch the nematode  gripping it in a tight hold
__label__0 the fungus penetrates the tissue of the worm by extending specialized hyphae called haustoria
__label__1 many parasitic fungi possess haustoria  as these structures penetrate the tissues of the host  release digestive enzymes within the host s body  and absorb the digested nutrients
__label__1 when both mating types are present in the same mycelium  it is called homothallic  or self  fertile
__label__1 heterothallic mycelia require two different  but compatible  mycelia to reproduce sexually
__label__0 the only class in the phylum chytridiomycota is the chytridiomycetes
__label__1 the chytrids are the simplest and most primitive eumycota  or true fungi
__label__1 the majority of known fungi belong to the phylum ascomycota  which is characterized by the formation of an ascus  plural  asci   a sac  like structure that contains haploid ascospores
__label__1 the majority of known fungi belong to the phylum ascomycota  which is characterized by the formation of an ascus  plural  asci   a sac  like structure that contains haploid ascospores
__label__0 many ascomycetes are of commercial importance
__label__0 this is the dikaryotic stage of the basidiomyces lifecyle and and it is the dominant stage
__label__1 eventually  the secondary mycelium generates a basidiocarp  which is a fruiting body that protrudes from the ground  this is what we think of as a mushroom
__label__0 the basidiocarp bears the developing basidia on the gills under its cap
__label__0 art connection
__label__1 the glomeromycota is a newly established phylum which comprises about  species that all live in close association with the roots of trees
__label__0 fossil records indicate that trees and their root symbionts share a long evolutionary history
__label__0 both parasites and pathogens harm the host  however  the pathogen causes a disease  whereas the parasite usually does not
__label__1 commensalism occurs when one member benefits without affecting the other
__label__1 mycotoxicosis is the poisoning of humans  and other animals  by foods contaminated by fungal toxins  mycotoxins
__label__1 mycotoxicosis is the poisoning of humans  and other animals  by foods contaminated by fungal toxins  mycotoxins
__label__1 mycetismus describes the ingestion of preformed toxins in poisonous mushrooms
__label__0 in addition  individuals who display hypersensitivity to molds and spores develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions
__label__0 the fungal partner can belong to the ascomycota  basidiomycota or zygomycota
__label__0 in a second type  the glomeromycete fungi form vesicular  arbuscular interactions with arbuscular mycorrhiza  sometimes called endomycorrhizae
__label__1 in a second type  the glomeromycete fungi form vesicular  arbuscular interactions with arbuscular mycorrhiza  sometimes called endomycorrhizae
__label__1 in these mycorrhiza  the fungi form arbuscules that penetrate root cells and are the site of the metabolic exchanges between the fungus and the host plant   link  and  link
__label__0 most biologists also consider green algae to be plants  although others exclude all algae from the plant kingdom
__label__0 the reason for this disagreement stems from the fact that only green algae  the charophytes  share common characteristics with land plants  such as using chlorophyll a and b plus carotene in the same proportion as plants
__label__0 these characteristics are absent in other types of algae
__label__0 two different types of spores are produced in land plants  resulting in the separation of sexes at different points in the lifecycle
__label__1 seedless non  vascular plants produce only one kind of spore and are called homosporous
__label__0 the gametophyte phase is dominant in these plants
__label__1 the male spores are called microspores  because of their smaller size  and develop into the male gametophyte  the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte
__label__0 heterospory is observed in a few seedless vascular plants and in all seed plants
__label__0 in the gametangia  precursor cells give rise to gametes by mitosis
__label__0 the male gametangium  antheridium  releases sperm
__label__1 many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia  the female gametangium
__label__0 in a further division  land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of vascular tissue  as detailed in  link
__label__1 plants that lack vascular tissue  which is formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients  are referred to as non  vascular plants
__label__1 plants that lack vascular tissue  which is formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients  are referred to as non  vascular plants
__label__0 liverworts  mosses  and hornworts are seedless  non  vascular plants that likely appeared early in land plant evolution
__label__0 liverwort plants can also reproduce asexually  by the breaking of branches or the spreading of leaf fragments called gemmae
__label__0 in this latter type of reproduction  the gemmae  small  intact  complete pieces of plant that are produced in a cup on the surface of the thallus  shown in  link    are splashed out of the cup by raindrops
__label__0 the gemmae then land nearby and develop into gametophytes
__label__0 for example  stomata are present on the stems of the sporophyte  and a primitive vascular system runs up the sporophyte s stalk
__label__0 additionally  mosses are anchored to the substrate  whether it is soil  rock  or roof tiles  by multicellular rhizoids
__label__0 these structures are precursors of roots
__label__1 a structure called a peristome increases the spread of spores after the tip of the capsule falls off at dispersal
__label__0 the concentric tissue around the mouth of the capsule is made of triangular  close  fitting units  a little like  teeth   these open and close depending on moisture levels  and periodically release spores
__label__1 the tissue consists of conducting cells  known as tracheids  and supportive filler tissue  called parenchyma
__label__1 xylem conductive cells incorporate the compound lignin into their walls  and are thus described as lignified
__label__1 lignin itself is a complex polymer that is impermeable to water and confers mechanical strength to vascular tissue
__label__1 pine cones  mature fronds of ferns  and flowers are all sporophylls  leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia
__label__1 strobili are cone  like structures that contain sporangia
__label__0 they are prominent in conifers and are commonly known as pine cones
__label__0 phylum monilophyta  class psilotopsida  whisk ferns
__label__0 while most ferns form large leaves and branching roots  the whisk ferns  class psilotopsida  lack both roots and leaves  probably lost by reduction
__label__0 photosynthesis takes place in their green stems  and small yellow knobs form at the tip of the branch stem and contain the sporangia
__label__0 some seeds are enveloped by sporophyte tissues upon maturation
__label__1 the layer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds the megasporangium  and later  the embryo  is called the integument
__label__0 female cones  or ovulate cones  contain two ovules per scale
__label__0 one megaspore mother cell  or megasporocyte  undergoes meiosis in each ovule
__label__0 cycads thrive in mild climates  and are often mistaken for palms because of the shape of their large  compound leaves
__label__0 to help make sure information goes from short  term memory to long  term memory  you can use memory  enhancing strategies
__label__1 one strategy is rehearsal  or the conscious repetition of information to be remembered  craik  watkins
__label__0 think about how you learned your multiplication tables as a child
__label__1 mnemonic devices are memory aids that help us organize information for encoding   link
__label__0 they are especially useful when we want to recall larger bits of information such as steps  stages  phases  and parts of a system  bellezza
__label__1 physical development involves growth and changes in the body and brain  the senses  motor skills  and health and wellness
__label__1 cognitive development involves learning  attention  memory  language  thinking  reasoning  and creativity
__label__1 psychosocial development involves emotions  personality  and social relationships
__label__0 this approach asks   what is normal development   in the early decades of the th century  normative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine norms  ie  average ages  of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the three domains  gesell        gesell  ilg    hall
__label__0 although children develop at slightly different rates  we can use these age  related averages as general guidelines to compare children with same  age peers to determine the approximate ages they should reach specific normative events called developmental milestones  eg  crawling  walking  writing  dressing  naming colors  speaking in sentences  and starting puberty
__label__0 these findings suggest the heritability of some personality traits
__label__1 heritability refers to the proportion of difference among people that is attributed to genetics
__label__0 some of the traits that the study reported as having more than a  heritability ratio include leadership  obedience to authority  a sense of well  being  alienation  resistance to stress  and fearfulness
__label__0 freud viewed development as discontinuous  he believed that each of us must pass through a series of stages during childhood  and that if we lack proper nurturance and parenting during a stage  we may become stuck  or fixated  in that stage
__label__0 freud s stages are called the stages of psychosexual development
__label__1 according to freud  children s pleasure  seeking urges are focused on a different area of the body  called an erogenous zone  at each of the five stages of development  oral  anal  phallic  latency  and genital
__label__0 while most of freud s ideas have not found support in modern research  we can not discount the contributions that freud has made to the field of psychology
__label__1 first  they assimilate new information or experiences in terms of their current schemata  assimilation is when they take in information that is comparable to what they already know
__label__1 accommodation describes when they change their schemata based on new information
__label__0 this process continues as children interact with their environment
__label__1 piaget s second stage is the preoperational stage  which is from approximately  to  years old
__label__0 in this stage  children can use symbols to represent words  images  and ideas  which is why children in this stage engage in pretend play
__label__1 piaget s third stage is the concrete operational stage  which occurs from about  to  years old
__label__0 in this stage  children can think logically about real  concrete  events  they have a firm grasp on the use of numbers and start to employ memory strategies
__label__0 a major task beginning in childhood and continuing into adolescence is discerning right from wrong
__label__0 psychologist lawrence kohlberg      extended upon the foundation that piaget built regarding cognitive development
__label__0 kohlberg believed that moral development  like cognitive development  follows a series of stages
__label__0 the field of social psychology studies topics at both the intra and interpersonal levels
__label__1 intrapersonal topics  those that pertain to the individual  include emotions and attitudes  the self  and social cognition  the ways in which we think about ourselves and others
__label__1 interpersonal topics  those that pertain to dyads and groups  include helping behavior   link    aggression  prejudice and discrimination  attraction and close relationships  and group processes and intergroup relationships
__label__1 situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate environment and surroundings
__label__1 in contrast  dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors  heider
__label__1 an internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes personality traits and temperament
__label__0 when you do well at a task  for example acing an exam  it is in your best interest to make a dispositional attribution for your behavior   i m smart    instead of a situational one   the exam was easy
__label__1 the tendency of an individual to take credit by making dispositional or internal attributions for positive outcomes but situational or external attributions for negative outcomes is known as the self  serving bias  miller  ross
__label__0 this bias serves to protect self  esteem
__label__1 during the first week after conception  the zygote divides and multiplies  going from a one  cell structure to two cells  then four cells  then eight cells  and so on
__label__0 this process of cell division is called mitosis
__label__0 mitosis is a fragile process  and fewer than one  half of all zygotes survive beyond the first two weeks  hall
__label__0 the developing fetus is completely dependent on the mother for life
__label__1 it is important that the mother takes good care of herself and receives prenatal care  which is medical care during pregnancy that monitors the health of both the mother and the fetus   link
__label__0 according to the national institutes of health   nih      routine prenatal care is important because it can reduce the risk of complications to the mother and fetus during pregnancy
__label__0 although small  a newborn is not completely helpless because his reflexes and sensory capacities help him interact with the environment from the moment of birth
__label__1 all healthy babies are born with newborn reflexes  inborn automatic responses to particular forms of stimulation
__label__0 reflexes help the newborn survive until it is capable of more complex behaviors  these reflexes are crucial to survival
__label__1 fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers  toes  and eyes  and enable coordination of small actions  eg  grasping a toy  writing with a pencil  and using a spoon
__label__1 gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and legs and involve larger movements  eg  balancing  running  and jumping
__label__0 a fourth style  known as disorganized attachment  was later described  main  solomon
__label__0 the most common type of attachment  also considered the healthiest  is called secure attachment   link
__label__0 in this type of attachment  the toddler prefers his parent over a stranger
__label__0 for parents who employ the permissive style of parenting  the kids run the show and anything goes
__label__0 permissive parents make few demands and rarely use punishment
__label__0 in pre  industrial society  children were considered adults when they reached physical maturity  but today we have an extended time between childhood and adulthood called adolescence
__label__1 adolescence is the period of development that begins at puberty and ends at emerging adulthood  which is discussed later
__label__0 in the united states  adolescence is seen as a time to develop independence from parents while remaining connected to them   link
__label__1 primary sexual characteristics are organs specifically needed for reproduction  like the uterus and ovaries in females and testes in males
__label__1 secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs  such as development of breasts and hips in girls  and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys
__label__1 girls experience menarche  the beginning of menstrual periods  usually around    years old  and boys experience spermarche  the first ejaculation  around    years old
__label__0 one major social determinant of human behavior is our social roles
__label__1 a social role is a pattern of behavior that is expected of a person in a given setting or group  hare
__label__0 each one of us has several social roles
__label__0 because of social roles  people tend to know what behavior is expected of them in specific  familiar settings
__label__1 a script is a person s knowledge about the sequence of events expected in a specific setting  schank  abelson
__label__0 how do you act on the first day of school  when you walk into an elevator  or are at a restaurant
__label__0 visit this website to hear an npr interview with philip zimbardo where he discusses the parallels between the stanford prison experiment and the abu ghraib prison in iraq
__label__0 when we experience cognitive dissonance  we are motivated to decrease it because it is psychologically  physically  and mentally uncomfortable
__label__0 we can reduce cognitive dissonance by bringing our cognitions  attitudes  and behaviors in line  that is  making them harmonious
__label__0 this can be done in different ways  such as
__label__0 in the previous section we discussed that the motivation to reduce cognitive dissonance leads us to change our attitudes  behaviors  and  or cognitions to make them consonant
__label__1 persuasion is the process of changing our attitude toward something based on some kind of communication
__label__0 much of the persuasion we experience comes from outside forces
__label__0 one effective strategy is the foot  in  the  door technique  cialdini    pliner  hart  kohl   saari
__label__1 using the foot  in  the  door technique  the persuader gets a person to agree to bestow a small favor or to buy a small item  only to later request a larger favor or purchase of a bigger item
__label__0 the foot  in  the  door technique was demonstrated in a study by freedman and fraser    in which participants who agreed to post small sign in their yard or sign a petition were more likely to agree to put a large sign in their yard than people who declined the first request   link
__label__0 asch    found that   of participants conformed to group pressure at least once by indicating the incorrect line
__label__1 conformity is the change in a person s behavior to go along with the group  even if he does not agree with the group
__label__0 why would people give the wrong answer
__label__1 stanley milgram was a social psychology professor at yale who was influenced by the trial of adolf eichmann  a nazi war criminal
__label__0 eichmann s defense for the atrocities he committed was that he was  just following orders
__label__0 milgram    wanted to test the validity of this defense  so he designed an experiment and initially recruited  men for his experiment
__label__0 another phenomenon that occurs within group settings is group polarization
__label__1 group polarization  teger  pruitt    is the strengthening of an original group attitude after the discussion of views within a group
__label__0 that is  if a group initially favors a viewpoint  after discussion the group consensus is likely a stronger endorsement of the viewpoint
__label__0 it impacts their lives and their family s lives in positive and negative physical and psychological ways
__label__1 industrial and organizational  i  o  psychology is a branch of psychology that studies how human behavior and psychology affect work and how they are affected by work
__label__0 as a result of its interest in worker wellbeing and relationships  organizational psychology also considers the subjects of harassment  including sexual harassment  and workplace violence
__label__1 human factors psychology is the study of how workers interact with the tools of work and how to design those tools to optimize workers  productivity  safety  and health
__label__0 these studies can involve interactions as straightforward as the fit of a desk  chair  and computer to a human having to sit on the chair at the desk using the computer for several hours each day
__label__1 analysis of the findings by later researchers led to the term the hawthorne effect  which describes the increase in performance of individuals who are noticed  watched  and paid attention to by researchers or supervisors  link
__label__0 what the original researchers found was that any change in a variable  such as lighting levels  led to an improvement in productivity  this was true even when the change was negative  such as a return to poor lighting
__label__0 today  i  o psychology is a diverse and deep field of research and practice  as you will learn about in the rest of this chapter
__label__0 the society for industrial and organizational psychology  siop   a division of the apa  lists  members  siop    and the bureau of labor statistics  us
__label__0 department of labor    has projected this profession will have the greatest growth of all job classifications in the  years following
__label__0 on average  a person with a master s degree in industrial  organizational psychology will earn over   a year  while someone with a doctorate will earn over   a year  khanna  medsker   ginter
__label__0 sometimes people will act on their prejudiced attitudes toward a group of people  and this behavior is known as discrimination
__label__1 discrimination is negative action toward an individual as a result of one s membership in a particular group  allport    dovidio  gaertner
__label__0 as a result of holding negative beliefs  stereotypes  and negative attitudes  prejudice  about a particular group  people often treat the target of prejudice poorly  such as excluding older adults from their circle of friends
__label__0 prejudice and discrimination persist in society due to social learning and conformity to social norms
__label__0 children learn prejudiced attitudes and beliefs from society  their parents  teachers  friends  the media  and other sources of socialization  such as facebook  okeeffe  clarke  pearson
__label__0 when interacting with the target of our prejudice  we tend to pay attention to information that is consistent with our stereotypic expectations and ignore information that is inconsistent with our expectations
__label__1 in this process  known as confirmation bias  we seek out information that supports our stereotypes and ignore information that is inconsistent with our stereotypes  wason  johnson  laird
__label__0 in the job interview example  the employer may not have noticed that the job applicant was friendly and engaging  and that he provided competent responses to the interview questions in the beginning of the interview
__label__1 because we often feel a strong sense of belonging and emotional connection to our in  groups  we develop in  group bias  a preference for our own group over other groups
__label__0 this in  group bias can result in prejudice and discrimination because the out  group is perceived as different and is less preferred than our in  group
__label__0 aggression takes two forms depending on one s motives  hostile or instrumental
__label__1 hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of anger with intent to cause pain  a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile aggression
__label__1 in contrast  instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not necessarily involve intent to cause pain  berkowitz     a contract killer who murders for hire displays instrumental aggression
__label__0 one form of negative social interactions among children that has become a national concern is bullying
__label__1 bullying is repeated negative treatment of another person  often an adolescent  over time  olweus
__label__0 a one  time incident in which one child hits another child on the playground would not be considered bullying  bullying is repeated behavior
__label__0 this is a common occurrence  as the following well  publicized event demonstrates
__label__0 in   in queens  new york  a year  old woman named kitty genovese was attacked by a person with a knife near the back entrance to her apartment building and again in the hallway inside her apartment building
__label__0 when the attack occurred  she screamed for help numerous times and eventually died from her stab wounds
__label__0 when you and another person share similar music taste  hobbies  food preferences  and so on  deciding what to do with your time together might be easy
__label__1 homophily is the tendency for people to form social networks  including friendships  marriage  business relationships  and many other types of relationships  with others who are similar  mcpherson et al
__label__0 robert sternberg    proposed that there are three components of love  intimacy  passion  and commitment
__label__0 these three components form a triangle that defines multiple types of love  this is known as sternberg s triangular theory of love   link
__label__1 intimacy is the sharing of details and intimate thoughts and emotions
__label__1 companionate love  which is characteristic of close friendships and family relationships  consists of intimacy and commitment but no passion
__label__1 romantic love is defined by having passion and intimacy  but no commitment
__label__1 finally  fatuous love is defined by having passion and commitment  but no intimacy  such as a long term sexual love affair
__label__0 this allows the i  o psychologist to access previous analyses for nearly any type of occupation
__label__0 this system is called o  net  accessible at wwwonlineonetcenterorg
__label__0 the site is open and you can see the ksas that are listed for your own position or one you might be curious about
__label__0 unless membership in that group directly affects potential job performance  a decision based on group membership is discriminatory   link
__label__0 to combat hiring discrimination  in the united states there are numerous city  state  and federal laws that prevent hiring based on various group  membership criteria
__label__0 for example  did you know it is illegal for a potential employer to ask your age in an interview
__label__1 the civil rights act and the age discrimination in employment act make provisions for bona fide occupational qualifications  bfoqs   which are requirements of certain occupations for which denying an individual employment would otherwise violate the law
__label__0 for example  there may be cases in which religion  national origin  age  and sex are bona fide occupational qualifications
__label__0 job stress affects job satisfaction
__label__0 job stress  or job strain  is caused by specific stressors in an occupation
__label__0 flextime usually involves a requirement of core hours spent in the workplace around which the employee may schedule his arrival and departure from work to meet family demands
__label__0 telecommuting involves employees working at home and setting their own hours  which allows them to work during different parts of the day  and to spend part of the day with their family
__label__0 recall that yahoo
__label__1 in the theory y approach  on the other hand  managers assume that most people seek inner satisfaction and fulfillment from their work
__label__0 employees function better under leadership that allows them to participate in  and provide input about  setting their personal and work goals
__label__0 organizations need to respond quickly to changes in these factors
__label__0 many companies are responding to these changes by structuring their organizations so that work can be delegated to work teams  which bring together diverse skills  experience  and expertise
__label__0 this is in contrast to organizational structures that have individuals at their base  naquin  tynan
__label__0 one well  recognized negative aspect of organizational culture is a culture of harassment  including sexual harassment
__label__0 most organizations of any size have developed sexual harassment policies that define sexual harassment  or harassment in general  and the procedures the organization has set in place to prevent and address it when it does occur
__label__0 this is a demonstration of the importance of procedural justice in organizations
__label__1 procedural justice refers to the fairness of the processes by which outcomes are determined in conflicts with or among employees
__label__0 the term stress as it relates to the human condition first emerged in scientific literature in the s  but it did not enter the popular vernacular until the s  lyon
__label__0 today  we often use the term loosely in describing a variety of unpleasant feeling states  for example  we often say we are stressed out when we feel frustrated  angry  conflicted  overwhelmed  or fatigued
__label__0 a useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well  being  lazarus  folkman
__label__1 a critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise  that is  judge  demanding or threatening events  often referred to as stressors   these appraisals  in turn  influence our reactions to such events
__label__0 two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard  primary and secondary appraisals
__label__0 he argued that stress can sometimes be a positive  motivating force that can improve the quality of our lives
__label__1 this kind of stress  which selye called eustress  from the greek eu   good    is a good kind of stress associated with positive feelings  optimal health  and performance
__label__0 a moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challenging situations
__label__0 as previously stated  scientific interest in stress goes back nearly a century
__label__0 one of the early pioneers in the study of stress was walter cannon  an eminent american physiologist at harvard medical school   link
__label__0 in the early part of the th century  cannon was the first to identify the body s physiological reactions to stress
__label__0 these physiological reactions were nonspecific  which means that regardless of the type of stressor  the same pattern of reactions would occur
__label__1 what selye discovered was the general adaptation syndrome  the body s nonspecific physiological response to stress
__label__0 if exposure to a stressor continues over a longer period of time  the stage of exhaustion ensues
__label__1 at this stage  the person is no longer able to adapt to the stressor  the body s ability to resist becomes depleted as physical wear takes its toll on the body s tissues and organs
__label__0 in short bursts  this process can have some favorable effects  such as providing extra energy  improving immune system functioning temporarily  and decreasing pain sensitivity
__label__0 however  extended release of cortisol  as would happen with prolonged or chronic stress  often comes at a high price
__label__0 for an individual to experience stress  he must first encounter a potential stressor
__label__0 in general  stressors can be placed into one of two broad categories  chronic and acute
__label__1 the holmes and rahe social readjustment rating scale  srrs  uses the correlational research method to identify the connection between stress and health
__label__0 that is  respondents  lcu scores are correlated with the number or frequency of self  reported symptoms indicating health problems
__label__1 some people who are exposed to chronically stressful work conditions can experience job burnout  which is a general sense of emotional exhaustion and cynicism in relation to one s job  maslach  jackson
__label__0 job burnout occurs frequently among those in human service jobs  eg  social workers  teachers  therapists  and police officers
__label__0 in cases of comorbidity  the best treatment is thought to address both  or multiple  disorders simultaneously  nida
__label__0 behavior therapies are used to treat comorbid conditions  and in many cases  psychotropic medications are used along with psychotherapy
__label__0 in a sense  the immune system is the body s surveillance system
__label__0 it consists of a variety of structures  cells  and mechanisms that serve to protect the body from invading toxins and microorganisms that can harm or damage the body s tissues and organs
__label__0 also  we noted earlier that stress hormones released during hypothalamic  pituitary  adrenal  hpa  axis activation can adversely impact immune function
__label__1 one way they do this is by inhibiting the production of lymphocytes  white blood cells that circulate in the body s fluids that are important in the immune response  everly  lating
__label__1 a major risk factor for heart disease is hypertension  which is high blood pressure
__label__0 hypertension forces a person s heart to pump harder  thus putting more physical strain on the heart
__label__0 in addition to anger and hostility  a number of other negative emotional states have been linked with heart disease  including negative affectivity and depression  suls  bunde
__label__1 negative affectivity is a tendency to experience distressed emotional states involving anger  contempt  disgust  guilt  fear  and nervousness  watson  clark   tellegen
__label__0 it has been linked with the development of both hypertension and heart disease
__label__0 once a person seeks treatment  whether voluntarily or involuntarily  he has an intake done to assess his clinical needs
__label__1 an intake is the therapist s first meeting with the client
__label__1 in group therapy  a clinician meets together with several clients with similar problems   link
__label__0 when children are placed in group therapy  it is particularly important to match clients for age and problems
__label__0 there are several different types of family therapy
__label__1 in structural family therapy  the therapist examines and discusses the boundaries and structure of the family  who makes the rules  who sleeps in the bed with whom  how decisions are made  and what are the boundaries within the family
__label__0 in some families  the parents do not work together to make rules  or one parent may undermine the other  leading the children to act out
__label__0 in modern practice  it has evolved ino what is known as psychodynamic therapy  which will be discussed later
__label__1 biomedical therapy involves medication andor medical procedures to treat psychological disorders
__label__0 first  we will explore the various psychotherapeutic orientations outlined in  link   many of these orientations were discussed in the introduction chapter
__label__0 consequently  a patient would demonstrate resistance to recalling these thoughts or situations
__label__1 in dream analysis  a therapist interprets the underlying meaning of dreams
__label__0 play therapy is often used with children since they are not likely to sit on a couch and recall their dreams or engage in traditional talk therapy
__label__1 this technique uses a therapeutic process of play to  help clients prevent or resolve psychosocial difficulties and achieve optimal growth   oconnor    p
__label__1 one commonly used classical conditioning therapeutic technique is counterconditioning  a client learns a new response to a stimulus that has previously elicited an undesirable behavior
__label__0 two counterconditioning techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy
__label__0 thirty years later  joseph wolpe    refined jones s techniques  giving us the behavior therapy technique of exposure therapy that is used today
__label__1 a popular form of exposure therapy is systematic desensitization  wherein a calm and pleasant state is gradually associated with increasing levels of anxiety  inducing stimuli
__label__0 the idea is that you ca nt be nervous and relaxed at the same time
__label__1 cognitive therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on how a person s thoughts lead to feelings of distress
__label__0 the idea behind cognitive therapy is that how you think determines how you feel and act
__label__0 one of the first forms of cognitive  behavioral therapy was rational emotive therapy  ret   which was founded by albert ellis and grew out of his dislike of freudian psychoanalysis  daniel  nd
__label__1 behaviorists such as joseph wolpe also influenced ellis s therapeutic approach  national association of cognitive  behavioral therapists  cognitive  behavioral therapy  cbt  helps clients examine how their thoughts affect their behavior
__label__0 it aims to change cognitive distortions and self  defeating behaviors
__label__0 rogers    felt that the term patient suggested the person seeking help was sick and looking for a cure
__label__1 since this is a form of nondirective therapy  a therapeutic approach in which the therapist does not give advice or provide interpretations but helps the person to identify conflicts and understand feelings  rogers    emphasized the importance of the person taking control of his own life to overcome life s challenges
__label__0 another biologically based treatment that continues to be used  although infrequently  is electroconvulsive therapy  ect   formerly known by its unscientific name as electroshock therapy
__label__1 it involves using an electrical current to induce seizures to help alleviate the effects of severe depression
__label__0 as an example  suppose bradford receives a midterm notice that he is failing statistics class
__label__0 if bradford adopts a problem  focused coping approach to managing his stress  he would be proactive in trying to alleviate the source of the stress
__label__0 he might contact his professor to discuss what must be done to raise his grade  he might also decide to set aside two hours daily to study statistics assignments  and he may seek tutoring assistance
__label__1 seligman believed that the dogs who failed to try to escape the later shocks were demonstrating learned helplessness  they had acquired a belief that they were powerless to do anything about the noxious stimulation they were receiving
__label__0 seligman also believed that the passivity and lack of initiative these dogs demonstrated was similar to that observed in human depression
__label__0 their review is aimed at determining which coping strategies are most effective at offsetting negative health outcomes associated with racism  related stress
__label__0 the authors examine the effectiveness of three coping strategies  focusing on racial identity to handle race  related stress  anger expression  suppression  and seeking social support
__label__0 you ve learned a bit about social support  so we ll focus the remainder of this discussion on the potential coping strategies of focusing on racial identity and anger expression  suppression
__label__0 focusing on racial identity refers to the process by which a person comes to feel as if he belongs to a given racial group  this may increase a sense of pride associated with group membership
__label__0 in the s  herbert benson  a cardiologist  developed a stress reduction method called the relaxation response technique  greenberg
__label__1 the relaxation response technique combines relaxation with transcendental meditation  and consists of four components  stein
__label__1 for practical purposes  a precise definition of happiness might incorporate each of these elements  an enduring state of mind consisting of joy  contentment  and other positive emotions  plus the sense that one s life has meaning and value  lyubomirsky
__label__0 the definition implies that happiness is a long  term state  what is often characterized as subjective well  being  rather than merely a transient positive mood we all experience from time to time
__label__0 in deliberately setting out to create a new direction and new orientation for psychology  seligman helped establish a growing movement and field of research called positive psychology  compton
__label__1 in a very general sense  positive psychology can be thought of as the science of happiness  it is an area of study that seeks to identify and promote those qualities that lead to greater fulfillment in our lives
__label__0 this field looks at people s strengths and what helps individuals to lead happy  contented lives  and it moves away from focusing on people s pathology  faults  and problems
__label__0 another factor that seems to be important in fostering a deep sense of well  being is the ability to derive flow from the things we do in life
__label__1 flow is described as a particular experience that is so engaging and engrossing that it becomes worth doing for its own sake  csikszentmihalyi
__label__0 it is usually related to creative endeavors and leisure activities  but it can also be experienced by workers who like their jobs or students who love studying  csikszentmihalyi
__label__0 in the th century  dorothea dix led reform efforts for mental health care in the united states   link
__label__0 she investigated how those who are mentally ill and poor were cared for  and she discovered an underfunded and unregulated system that perpetuated abuse of this population  tiffany
__label__0 other individuals might voluntarily seek treatment
__label__1 voluntary treatment means the person chooses to attend therapy to obtain relief from symptoms
__label__1 he called this condition early infantile autism  and it was characterized mainly by an inability to form close emotional ties with others  speech and language abnormalities  repetitive behaviors  and an intolerance of minor changes in the environment and in normal routines  bregman
__label__0 what the dsm refers to as autism spectrum disorder today  is a direct extension of kanner s work
__label__1 dissociative disorders are characterized by an individual becoming split off  or dissociated  from her core sense of self
__label__0 there are five major chlorophylls  a  b  c and d and a related molecule found in prokaryotes called bacteriochlorophyll
__label__0 chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the following discussion
__label__0 with dozens of different forms  carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments
__label__0 the carotenoids found in fruit  such as the red of tomato  lycopene   the yellow of corn seeds  zeaxanthin   or the orange of an orange peel    carotene   are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers
__label__0 when studying a photosynthetic organism  scientists can determine the types of pigments present by generating absorption spectra
__label__1 an instrument called a spectrophotometer can differentiate which wavelengths of light a substance can absorb
__label__0 spectrophotometers measure transmitted light and compute from it the absorption
__label__0 it is at this step in the reaction center  this step in photosynthesis  that light energy is converted into an excited electron
__label__0 all of the subsequent steps involve getting that electron onto the energy carrier nadph for delivery to the calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto carbon for long  term storage in the form of a carbohydrate  psii and psi are two major components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain  which also includes the cytochrome complex
__label__1 the cytochrome complex  an enzyme composed of two protein complexes  transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone  pq  to the protein plastocyanin  pc   thus enabling both the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from psii to psi
__label__0 these reactions actually have several names associated with them
__label__0 another term  the calvin cycle  is named for the man who discovered it  and because these reactions function as a cycle
__label__0 others call it the calvin  benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery
__label__0 there are two kinds of communication in the world of living cells
__label__1 communication between cells is called intercellular signaling  and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling
__label__0 an easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the latin origin of the prefixes  inter means
__label__0 chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small  usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands
__label__0 ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules
__label__1 ligands interact with proteins in target cells  which are cells that are affected by chemical signals  these proteins are also called receptors
__label__0 ligands and receptors exist in several varieties  however  a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds only that ligand
__label__0 signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast  moving electrical impulses
__label__1 when these impulses reach the end of the axon  the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell  the cell emitting the signal
__label__1 the neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells  which are called chemical synapses   link
__label__1 autocrine signals are produced by signaling cells that can also bind to the ligand that is released
__label__0 this means the signaling cell and the target cell can be the same or a similar cell  the prefix auto means self  a reminder that the signaling cell sends a signal to itself
__label__1 cell  surface receptors  also known as transmembrane receptors  are cell surface  membrane  anchored  integral  proteins that bind to external ligand molecules
__label__1 this type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction  in which an extracellular signal is converted into an intercellular signal
__label__1 g  protein  linked receptors bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a g  protein
__label__0 the activated g  protein then interacts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane   link
__label__0 conformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane region of the receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins
__label__1 in some cases  binding of the ligand causes dimerization of the receptor  which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer
__label__1 a dimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules  often identical  join together
__label__0 this variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types
__label__1 another complicating element is signal integration of the pathways  in which signals from two or more different cell  surface receptors merge to activate the same response in the cell
__label__0 this process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell commits to a specific response
__label__0 the response to the increase in ca  varies  depending on the cell type involved
__label__1 for example  in the   cells of the pancreas  ca  signaling leads to the release of insulin  and in muscle cells  an increase in ca  leads to muscle contractions  another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic amp  camp
__label__0 cyclic amp is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from atp   link
__label__0 the enzyme phospholipase c cleaves pip to form diacylglycerol  dag  and inositol triphosphate  ip    link
__label__0 these products of the cleavage of pip serve as second messengers
__label__1 when a cell is damaged  superfluous  or potentially dangerous to an organism  a cell can initiate a mechanism to trigger programmed cell death  or apoptosis
__label__0 apoptosis allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that prevents the release of potentially damaging molecules from inside the cell
__label__1 budding yeasts   link   are able to participate in a process that is similar to sexual reproduction that entails two haploid cells  cells with one  half the normal number of chromosomes  combining to form a diploid cell  a cell with two sets of each chromosome  which is what normal body cells contain
__label__0 in order to find another haploid yeast cell that is prepared to mate  budding yeasts secrete a signaling molecule called mating factor
__label__0 when mating factor binds to cell  surface receptors in other yeast cells that are nearby  they stop their normal growth cycles and initiate a cell signaling cascade that includes protein kinases and gtp  binding proteins that are similar to g  proteins
__label__0 the continuity of life from one cell to another has its foundation in the reproduction of cells by way of the cell cycle
__label__1 the cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events that describes the stages of a cell s life from the division of a single parent cell to the production of two new daughter cells
__label__0 the mechanisms involved in the cell cycle are highly regulated
__label__0 human body cells have  chromosomes  while human gametes  sperm or eggs  have  chromosomes each
__label__1 a typical body cell  or somatic cell  contains two matched sets of chromosomes  a configuration known as diploid
__label__0 the letter n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes  therefore  a diploid organism is designated n
__label__1 matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous   same knowledge   chromosomes
__label__0 homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location  or locus
__label__1 genes  the functional units of chromosomes  determine specific characteristics by coding for specific proteins
__label__0 dna replicates in the s phase of interphase
__label__0 after replication  the chromosomes are composed of two linked sister chromatids
__label__0 when fully compact  the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins
__label__0 throughout interphase  nuclear dna remains in a semi  condensed chromatin configuration
__label__1 in the s phase  dna replication can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of dna molecules  sister chromatids  that are firmly attached to the centromeric region
__label__0 the centrosome is duplicated during the s phase
__label__1 in the g phase  the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation
__label__0 some cell organelles are duplicated  and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic phase
__label__1 during prophase  the  first phase   the nuclear envelope starts to dissociate into small vesicles  and the membranous organelles  such as the golgi complex or golgi apparatus  and endoplasmic reticulum   fragment and disperse toward the periphery of the cell
__label__0 the nucleolus disappears  disperses
__label__0 chromosomes become more condensed and discrete
__label__1 each sister chromatid develops a protein structure called a kinetochore in the centromeric region   link
__label__0 the proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules
__label__1 during telophase  the  distance phase   the chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense  unravel   relaxing into a chromatin configuration
__label__0 the mitotic spindles are depolymerized into tubulin monomers that will be used to assemble cytoskeletal components for each daughter cell
__label__0 during telophase  these golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form a phragmoplast  a vesicular structure  at the metaphase plate
__label__1 there  the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls  this structure is called a cell plate
__label__0 as more vesicles fuse  the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell
__label__1 the genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto  oncogenes
__label__1 proto  oncogenes are normal genes that  when mutated in certain ways  become oncogenes  genes that cause a cell to become cancerous
__label__1 karyokinesis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus and thus no need to direct one copy of the multiple chromosomes into each daughter cell
__label__0 this type of cell division is called binary  prokaryotic  fission  binary fission
__label__0 formation of the ftsz ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site
__label__0 a septum is formed between the nucleoids  extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell
__label__0 when the new cell walls are in place  the daughter cells separate
__label__0 haploid cells  containing a single copy of each homologous chromosome  are found only within structures that give rise to either gametes or spores
__label__1 spores are haploid cells that can produce a haploid organism or can fuse with another spore to form a diploid cell
__label__0 all animals and most plants produce eggs and sperm  or gametes
__label__1 the synaptonemal complex  a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes  first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes
__label__1 the tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis
__label__0 in synapsis  the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other
__label__1 located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules
__label__0 these assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover  or genetic recombination  between the non  sister chromatids
__label__0 near the recombination nodule on each chromatid  the double  stranded dna is cleaved  the cut ends are modified  and a new connection is made between the non  sister chromatids
__label__1 when the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another  the ploidy level  the number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleus  has been reduced from two to one
__label__0 for this reason  meiosis i is referred to as a reduction division
__label__0 there is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis
__label__1 nearly all animals employ a diploid  dominant life  cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are the gametes
__label__1 early in the development of the embryo  specialized diploid cells  called germ cells  are produced within the gonads  such as the testes and ovaries
__label__0 germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the cell line and meiosis to produce gametes
__label__0 supported by the monastery  he taught physics  botany  and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels
__label__1 in   he began a decade  long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants  ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary model system  a system with convenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems
__label__0 in   mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly  pea plants to the local natural history society
__label__0 mendel was the first researcher to see it
__label__1 instead of continuous characteristics  mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes  specifically  violet versus white flowers   this is referred to as discontinuous variation
__label__0 mendel s choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring  nor were they absorbed  but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on
__label__1 mendel collected the seeds belonging to the p plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season
__label__0 these offspring were called the f  or the first filial  filial  offspring  daughter or son   generation
__label__0 once mendel examined the characteristics in the f generation of plants  he allowed them to self  fertilize naturally
__label__0 when mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers and vice versa  he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent  male or female  contributed which trait
__label__1 this is called a reciprocal cross  a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross
__label__0 for the other six characteristics mendel examined  the f and f generations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color
__label__0 the product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics
__label__1 the product rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone
__label__0 two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics
__label__1 the observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype
__label__1 an organism s underlying genetic makeup  consisting of both physically visible and non  expressed alleles  is called its genotype
__label__0 mendel s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait
__label__0 when p plants with contrasting traits were cross  fertilized  all of the offspring were heterozygous for the contrasting trait  meaning that their genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined
__label__1 beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents  mendel also developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote
__label__0 called the test cross  this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders
__label__0 in a test cross  the dominant  expressing organism is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic
__label__1 a variation on incomplete dominance is codominance  in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously expressed in the heterozygote
__label__0 an example of codominance is the mn blood groups of humans
__label__0 the sex chromosomes are one pair of non  homologous chromosomes
__label__0 until now  we have only considered inheritance patterns among non  sex chromosomes  or autosomes
__label__1 in addition to  homologous pairs of autosomes  human females have a homologous pair of x chromosomes  whereas human males have an xy chromosome pair
__label__0 because the gene is essential  these individuals might fail to develop past fertilization  die in utero  or die later in life  depending on what life stage requires this gene
__label__1 an inheritance pattern in which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the heterozygote may be normal or have some altered non  lethal phenotype is referred to as recessive lethal  for crosses between heterozygous individuals with a recessive lethal allele that causes death before birth when homozygous  only wild  type homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed
__label__0 the genotypic ratio would therefore be
__label__0 observing that true  breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to f generations that all expressed the dominant trait and f generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a  ratio  mendel proposed the law of segregation
__label__1 this law states that paired unit factors  genes  must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor
__label__0 however  each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes  organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string
__label__1 the segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by linkage  in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair
__label__0 however  because of the process of recombination  or  crossover   it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave independently  or as if they are not linked
__label__1 it is now known that the pairing and interaction between homologous chromosomes  known as synapsis  does more than simply organize the homologs for migration to separate daughter cells
__label__1 when synapsed  homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in a process called homologous recombination  or more simply   crossing over
__label__0 conversely  alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were likely to be inherited together
__label__1 the average number of crossovers between two alleles  that is  their recombination frequency  correlated with their genetic distance from each other  relative to the locations of other genes on that chromosome
__label__0 considering the example cross between aabb and aabb above  the frequency of recombination could be calculated as
__label__1 a karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes  and includes their length  banding pattern  and centromere position
__label__1 to obtain a view of an individual s karyotype  cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart  or karyogram  also known as an ideogram   link
__label__0 disorders of chromosome number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes  as well as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes
__label__1 they are caused by nondisjunction  which occurs when pairs of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis
__label__0 misaligned or incomplete synapsis  or a dysfunction of the spindle apparatus that facilitates chromosome migration  can cause nondisjunction
__label__1 an individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets  two for diploid species  is called polyploid
__label__0 for instance  fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote
__label__0 an inversion can be pericentric and include the centromere  or paracentric and occur outside of the centromere   link
__label__0 a pericentric inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the relative lengths of the chromosome arms  making these inversions easily identifiable
__label__1 gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate dna fragments of different sizes
__label__1 usually the gel is made of a chemical called agarose
__label__0 two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi directionally as replication proceeds
__label__0 single  strand binding proteins coat the single strands of dna near the replication fork to prevent the single  stranded dna from winding back into a double helix
__label__0 dna polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the   to   direction  a new dna strand can be only extended in this direction
__label__1 one strand  which is complementary to the   to   parental dna strand  is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork because the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction
__label__0 this continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand
__label__0 the other strand  complementary to the   to   parental dna  is extended away from the replication fork  in small fragments known as okazaki fragments  each requiring a primer to start the synthesis
__label__0 the overall direction of the lagging strand will be   to    and that of the leading strand   to
__label__0 a protein called the sliding clamp holds the dna polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides
__label__1 the sliding clamp is a ring  shaped protein that binds to the dna and holds the polymerase in place
__label__0 most of the mistakes during dna replication are promptly corrected by dna polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added   link
__label__0 in proofreading  the dna pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one  so a correction can be made
__label__0 the polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand
__label__0 errors during dna replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in dna
__label__1 mutations  variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome  can also occur because of damage to dna
__label__0 such mutations may be of two types  induced or spontaneous
__label__0 mutations may have a wide range of effects
__label__1 some mutations are not expressed  these are known as silent mutations
__label__1 point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair
__label__1 transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind  for example  a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine
__label__1 transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine  or vice versa  for example  cytosine  a pyrimidine  is replaced by adenine  a purine
__label__1 mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base  known as an insertion  or the removal of a base  also known as deletion
__label__1 the flow of genetic information in cells from dna to mrna to protein is described by the central dogma   link    which states that genes specify the sequence of mrnas  which in turn specify the sequence of proteins
__label__0 the decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and rnas
__label__1 this demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid
__label__0 these nucleotide triplets are called codons
__label__0 the insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame  thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid   link
__label__1 the central region of the cell in which prokaryotic dna resides is called the nucleoid
__label__1 in addition  prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids  which are shorter circular dna molecules that may only contain one or a few genes
__label__0 plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance  transcription in prokaryotes  and in eukaryotes  requires the dna double helix to partially unwind in the region of mrna synthesis
__label__1 the nucleotide pair in the dna double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first   mrna nucleotide is transcribed is called the  site  or the initiation site
__label__0 nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream
__label__0 coli  the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits  two of which are identical
__label__0 four of these subunits  denoted       and   comprise the polymerase core enzyme
__label__0 these subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed  and they disassemble once transcription is complete
__label__0 although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes  a few elements are conserved
__label__1 at the  and  regions upstream of the initiation site  there are two promoter consensus sequences  or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species   link
__label__1 the  consensus sequence  called the  region  is tataat
__label__0 the mrna folds back on itself  and the complementary c  g nucleotides bind together
__label__0 the result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it begins to transcribe a region rich in a  t nucleotides
__label__0 the complementary u  a region of the mrna transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template dna
__label__0 this sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors
__label__0 further upstream of the tata box  eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more gc  rich boxes  ggcg  or octamer boxes  atttgcat
__label__0 these elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often identified in more  active  genes that are constantly being expressed by the cell
__label__0 each mrna molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes  all synthesizing protein in the same direction  reading the mrna from   to   and synthesizing the polypeptide from the n terminus to the c terminus
__label__1 the complete mrna  poly  ribosome structure is called a polysome
__label__1 when an in  frame aug is encountered during translation elongation  a non  formylated methionine is inserted by a regular met  trnamet  in e coli mrna  a sequence upstream of the first aug codon  called the shine  dalgarno sequence  aggagg   interacts with the rrna molecules that compose the ribosome
__label__0 this interaction anchors the s ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mrna template
__label__0 during and after translation  individual amino acids may be chemically modified  signal sequences may be appended  and the new protein  folds  into a distinct three  dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions
__label__1 a signal sequence is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment
__label__0 these sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein s  train ticket  to its ultimate destination
__label__0 once elongation is complete  the pre  mrna is cleaved by an endonuclease between an aauaaa consensus sequence and a gu  rich sequence  leaving the aauaaa sequence on the pre  mrna
__label__1 an enzyme called poly  a polymerase then adds a string of approximately  a residues  called the poly  a tail
__label__0 this modification further protects the pre  mrna from degradation and signals the export of the cellular factors that the transcript needs to the cytoplasm
__label__0 some of a ribosome s rna molecules are purely structural  whereas others have catalytic or binding activities
__label__0 mature trnas take on a three  dimensional structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end   link
__label__1 the anticodon is a three  nucleotide sequence in a trna that interacts with an mrna codon through complementary base pairing
__label__0 the dna of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm
__label__1 proteins that are needed for a specific function  or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway  are encoded together in blocks called operons
__label__0 for example  all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose  or lac  operon
__label__0 coli can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes
__label__0 these five genes are next to each other in what is called the tryptophan  trp  operon   link
__label__0 if tryptophan is present in the environment  then e
__label__0 when tryptophan is not present in the cell  the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator  therefore  the operon is active and tryptophan is synthesized
__label__0 because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned off  the trp operon is negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative regulators
__label__1 the lac operon  an inducer operonthe third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducible operons  which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell
__label__0 the lac operon is a typical inducible operon
__label__0 there are hundreds of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a particular dna sequence motif
__label__1 when transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene  it is referred to as a cis  acting element  because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene
__label__1 the region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site
__label__0 before the mrna leaves the nucleus  it is given two protective
__label__0 the   cap  which is placed on the   end of the mrna  is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule  gtp
__label__1 the   cap  which is placed on the   end of the mrna  is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule  gtp
__label__1 the poly  a tail  which is attached to the   end  is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides
__label__0 proteins  called rna  binding proteins  or rbps  can bind to the regions of the rna just upstream or downstream of the protein  coding region
__label__1 these regions in the rna that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated regions  or utrs
__label__0 they are not introns  those have been removed in the nucleus
__label__0 the mirnas are made in the nucleus as longer pre  mirnas
__label__0 these pre  mirnas are chopped into mature mirnas by a protein called dicer
__label__0 like transcription factors and rbps  mature mirnas recognize a specific sequence and bind to the rna  however  mirnas also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the rna  induced silencing complex  risc
__label__1 in translation  the complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex
__label__1 the first protein to bind to the rna to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor  eif
__label__0 the eif protein is active when it binds to the high  energy molecule guanosine triphosphate  gtp
__label__0 gtp provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate  gdp
__label__0 the eif protein bound to gtp binds to the small s ribosomal subunit
__label__0 when bound  the methionine initiator trna associates with the eifs ribosome complex  bringing along with it the mrna to be translated
__label__0 while these changes do nt occur simultaneously in one cancer  changes at each of these levels can be detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals
__label__1 therefore  changes in histone acetylation  epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing   activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation  increased rna stability  increased translational control  and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells
__label__0 scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell
__label__0 most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired  such as degradation of unwanted molecules and separation from the dna sample
__label__1 cells are broken using a lysis buffer  a solution which is mostly a detergent   lysis means  to split   these enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes
__label__0 macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins  and ribonucleases  rnases  that break down rna
__label__1 dna fragments can also be amplified from an rna template in a process called reverse transcriptase pcr  rt  pcr
__label__0 the first step is to recreate the original dna template strand  called cdna  by applying dna nucleotides to the mrna
__label__0 the nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences
__label__1 when dna is transferred to a nylon membrane  the technique is called southern blotting  and when rna is transferred to a nylon membrane  it is called northern blotting
__label__0 southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain dna sequences in a given genome  and northern blots are used to detect gene expression
__label__1 plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large  scale production of important reagents  such as insulin and human growth hormone
__label__0 an important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign dna fragment can be introduced via the multiple cloning site  mcs
__label__1 the mcs is a short dna sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases
__label__0 they are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis
__label__1 proteins that are expressed from recombinant dna molecules are called recombinant proteins
__label__0 not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes
__label__1 genetic engineering is the alteration of an organism s genotype using recombinant dna technology to modify an organism s dna to achieve desirable traits
__label__0 the addition of foreign dna in the form of recombinant dna vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering
__label__0 the methods used to disable gene function are collectively called gene targeting
__label__1 gene targeting is the use of recombinant dna vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene  either by introducing mutations in a gene  or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism
__label__1 in nature  the disease  causing a tumefaciens have a set of plasmids  called the ti plasmids  tumor  inducing plasmids   that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants
__label__0 dna from the ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell s genome
__label__0 the maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets
__label__1 a genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome
__label__0 genetic maps provide the big picture  similar to a map of interstate highways  and use genetic markers  similar to landmarks
__label__1 the study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis  a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between genes to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment
__label__0 the term linkage was used before the discovery of dna
__label__0 there are three methods used to create a physical map  cytogenetic mapping  radiation hybrid mapping  and sequence mapping
__label__1 cytogenetic mapping uses information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the chromosome   link
__label__0 it is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping  but not the exact distance  number of base pairs
__label__0 sequence mapping resulted from dna sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs
__label__1 the creation of genomic libraries and complementary dna  cdna  libraries  collections of cloned sequences or all dna from a genome  has sped up the process of physical mapping
__label__0 this outcome suggests that technology has created new avenues for obscene material to be disseminated
__label__1 the children s internet protection act  however  requires k schools and public libraries receiving internet access using special e  rate discounts to filter or block access to obscene material and other material deemed harmful to minors  with certain exceptions
__label__0 there has been increased conflict over the second amendment in recent years due to school shootings and gun violence
__label__0 as a result  gun rights have become a highly charged political issue
__label__0 the third amendment says in full
__label__0 furthermore  the courts have found that police do not generally need a warrant to search the passenger compartment of a car   link    or to search people entering the united states from another country
__label__0 see  for example  arizona v gant   us
__label__1 when a warrant is needed  law enforcement officers do not need enough evidence to secure a conviction  but they must demonstrate to a judge that there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed or evidence will be found
__label__0 probable cause is the legal standard for determining whether a search or seizure is constitutional or a crime has been committed  it is a lower threshold than the standard of proof at a criminal trial
__label__0 many of the provisions dealing with the rights of the accused are included in the fifth amendment  accordingly  it is one of the longest in the bill of rights
__label__0 the fifth amendment states in full
__label__1 perhaps the most famous provision of the fifth amendment is its protection against self  incrimination  or the right to remain silent
__label__0 this provision is so well known that we have a phrase for it   taking the fifth
__label__0 people have the right not to give evidence in court or to law enforcement officers that might constitute an admission of guilt or responsibility for a crime
__label__0 the greatest recent controversy over economic liberty has been sparked by cities  and states  use of the power of eminent domain to take property for redevelopment
__label__0 traditionally  the main use of eminent domain was to obtain property for transportation corridors like railroads  highways  canals and reservoirs  and pipelines  which require fairly straight routes to be efficient
__label__0 most people accused of crimes decline their right to a jury trial
__label__1 this choice is typically the result of a plea bargain  an agreement between the defendant and the prosecutor in which the defendant pleads guilty to the charge  s  in question  or perhaps to less serious charges  in exchange for more lenient punishment than he or she might receive if convicted after a full trial
__label__0 there are a number of reasons why this might happen
__label__0 the eighth amendment says  in full
__label__0 the tenth amendment is as follows
__label__0 although several state constitutions do list the right to privacy as a protected right  the explicit recognition by the supreme court of a right to privacy in the us constitution emerged only in the middle of the twentieth century
__label__1 in   the court spelled out the right to privacy for the first time in griswold v connecticut  a case that struck down a state law forbidding even married individuals to use any form of contraception  griswold v connecticut   us     although many subsequent cases before the supreme court also dealt with privacy in the course of intimate  sexual conduct  the issue of privacy matters as well in the context of surveillance and monitoring by government and private parties of our activities  movements  and communications
__label__0 both these senses of privacy are examined below
__label__0 beyond the issues of contraception and abortion  the right to privacy has been interpreted to encompass a more general right for adults to have noncommercial  consensual sexual relationships in private
__label__1 however  this legal development is relatively new  as recently as   the supreme court ruled that states could still criminalize sex acts between two people of the same sex  bowers v hardwick   us
__label__1 that decision was overturned in  in lawrence v texas  which invalidated state laws that criminalized sodomy  lawrence v texas   us
__label__0 the proclamation that  all men are created equal  appears in the declaration of independence  and the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the us constitution requires that the federal government treat people equally
__label__0 according to chief justice earl warren in the supreme court case of bolling v sharpe      discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process  bolling v sharpe   us
__label__0 additional guarantees of equality are provided by the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment  ratified in   which states in part that  no state shall
__label__0 
__label__0 discrimination based on gender or sex is generally examined with intermediate scrutiny
__label__0 the standard of intermediate scrutiny was first applied by the supreme court in craig v boren    and again in clark v jeter  craig v boren   us      clark v jeter   us
__label__1 it requires the government to demonstrate that treating men and women differently is  substantially related to an important governmental objective   this puts the burden of proof on the government to demonstrate why the unequal treatment is justifiable  not on the individual who alleges unfair discrimination has taken place
__label__0 clearly  then  new civil rights issues can emerge over time
__label__0 how can we  as citizens  identify them as they emerge and distinguish genuine claims of discrimination from claims by those who have merely been unable to convince a majority to agree with their viewpoints
__label__0 the spread of slavery into the west seemed inevitable  however  following the supreme court s ruling in the case dred scott v sandford  dred scott v sandford   us
__label__0 decided in
__label__0 scott  who had been born into slavery but had spent time in free states and territories  argued that his temporary residence in a territory where slavery had been banned by the federal government had made him a free man
__label__0 new york  harper  row
__label__0 although at the beginning of the war president abraham lincoln had been willing to allow slavery to continue in the south to preserve the union  he changed his policies regarding abolition over the course of the war
__label__0 the first step was the issuance of the emancipation proclamation on january      link
__label__0 although it stated  all persons held as slaves
__label__0 the changes wrought by the fourteenth amendment were more extensive
__label__1 in addition to introducing the equal protection clause to the constitution  this amendment also extended the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the states  required the states to respect the privileges or immunities of all citizens  and  for the first time  defined citizenship at the national and state levels
__label__0 perhaps the most famous of the tools of disenfranchisement were literacy tests and understanding tests
__label__1 literacy tests  which had been used in the north since the s to disqualify naturalized european immigrants from voting  called on the prospective voter to demonstrate his  and later her  ability to read a particular passage of text
__label__0 w e b
__label__0 du bois  however  argued for a more confrontational approach and in  founded the national association for the advancement of colored people  naacp  as a rallying point for securing equality
__label__0 liberal whites dominated the organization in its early years  but african americans assumed control over its operations in the s  naacp   years of history   httpsdonatenaacporgpagesnaacphistory  april
__label__0 a few months later  in little rock  arkansas  governor orval faubus resisted court  ordered integration and mobilized national guard troops to keep black students out of central high school
__label__0 president eisenhower then called up the arkansas national guard for federal duty  essentially taking the troops out of faubus s hands  and sent soldiers of the st airborne division to escort students to and from classes  as shown in  link

__label__0 new haven  ct  yale university press
__label__1 in the case of shelley v kraemer     the supreme court held that while such covenants did not violate the fourteenth amendment because they consisted of agreements between private citizens  their provisions could not be enforced by courts  shelley v kraemer   us
__label__0 because state courts are government institutions and the fourteenth amendment prohibits the government from denying people equal protection of the law  the courts  enforcement of such covenants would be a violation of the amendment
__label__0 thus  if a white family chose to sell its house to a black family and the other homeowners in the neighborhood tried to sue the seller  the court would not hear the case
__label__0 these newer groups tended to prefer more confrontational approaches  including the use of direct action campaigns relying on marches and demonstrations
__label__0 the strategies of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience  or the refusal to obey an unjust law  had been effective in the campaign led by mahatma gandhi to liberate colonial india from british rule in the s and s
__label__0 civil rights pioneers adopted these measures in the  montgomery bus boycott
__label__0 not only did the act outlaw government discrimination and the unequal application of voting qualifications by race  but it also  for the first time  outlawed segregation and other forms of discrimination by most businesses that were open to the public  including hotels  theaters  and restaurants that were not private clubs
__label__1 it outlawed discrimination on the basis of race  ethnicity  religion  sex  or national origin by most employers  and it created the equal employment opportunity commission  eeoc  to monitor employment discrimination claims and help enforce this provision of the law
__label__0 the provisions that affected private businesses and employers were legally justified not by the fourteenth amendment s guarantee of equal protection of the laws but instead by congress s power to regulate interstate commerce  see heart of atlanta motel  inc v united states   us      katzenbach v mcclung   us      which built on wickard v filburn   us
__label__0 instead of using marches and demonstrations to change people s attitudes  calling for tougher civil rights laws  or suing for their rights in court  they favored more immediate action that forced whites to give in to their demands
__label__0 men like malcolm x  the leader of the nation of islam  and groups like the black panthers were willing to use violence to achieve their goals   linklouis e lomax

__label__0 news and world report   january   httpwwwusnewscomnewsblogsdatamineuseducationstillseparateandunequal
__label__0 during the late s and early s  efforts to tackle these problems were stymied by large  scale public opposition  not just in the south but across the nation
__label__1 attempts to integrate public schools through the use of busing  transporting students from one segregated neighborhood to another to achieve more racially balanced schools  were particularly unpopular and helped contribute to  white flight  from cities to the suburbs  sokol
__label__1 this white flight has created de facto segregation  a form of segregation that results from the choices of individuals to live in segregated communities without government action or support
__label__0 because affirmative action attempts to redress discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity  it is generally subject to the strict scrutiny standard  which means the burden of proof is on the government to demonstrate the necessity of racial discrimination to achieve a compelling governmental interest
__label__1 in   in bakke v california  the supreme court upheld affirmative action and said that colleges and universities could consider race when deciding whom to admit but could not establish racial quotas  bakke v california   us
__label__1 in   the supreme court reaffirmed the bakke decision in grutter v bollinger  which said that taking race or ethnicity into account as one of several factors in admitting a student to a college or university was acceptable  but a system setting aside seats for a specific quota of minority students was not
__label__0 grutter v bollinger   us
__label__0 all these issues are back under discussion in the supreme court with the re  arguing of fisher v university of texas  fisher v university of texas   us        fisher v university of texas   us
__label__1 in fisher v university of texas    known as fisher i   university of texas student abigail fisher brought suit to declare ut s race  based admissions policy as inconsistent with grutter
__label__0 the court did not see the ut policy that way and allowed it  so long as it remained narrowly tailored and not quota  based
__label__0 they often found they were hindered in their efforts  however  either by the law or by widely held beliefs that they were weak  silly creatures who should leave important issues to men  keyssar
__label__0 one of the leaders of the early women s movement  elizabeth cady stanton   link    was shocked and angered when she sought to attend an  antislavery meeting in london  only to learn that women would not be allowed to participate and had to sit apart from the men
__label__0 at this convention  she made the acquaintance of another american female abolitionist  lucretia mott   link    who was also appalled by the male reformers  treatment of women  elizabeth cady stanton
__label__0 
__label__1 along with other feminists  advocates of women s equality   such as her friend and colleague susan b anthony  stanton fought for rights for women besides suffrage  including the right to seek higher education
__label__0 as a result of their efforts  several states passed laws that allowed married women to retain control of their property and let divorced women keep custody of their children  jean h baker
__label__1 the more radical national woman s party  nwp   led by alice paul  advocated the use of stronger tactics
__label__0 the nwp held public protests and picketed outside the white house   linkkeyssar
__label__0 demonstrators were often beaten and arrested  and suffragists were subjected to cruel treatment in jail
__label__0 nevertheless  women continued to be denied jobs because of their sex and were often sexually harassed at the workplace
__label__0 in   feminists who were angered by the lack of progress made by women and by the government s lackluster enforcement of title vii organized the national organization for women  now
__label__1 now promoted workplace equality  including equal pay for women  and also called for the greater presence of women in public office  the professions  and graduate and professional degree programs
__label__0 although the era failed to be ratified  title ix of the united states education amendments of  passed into law as a federal statute  not as an amendment  as the era was meant to be
__label__1 title ix applies to all educational institutions that receive federal aid and prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in academic programs  dormitory space  health  care access  and school activities including sports

__label__0 the legal aspects of indian affairs from  to    american academy of political science
__label__0 this was long after the passage of the fourteenth amendment in   which granted citizenship to african americans but not  the supreme court decided in elk v wilkins     to native americans  elk v wilkins    us
__label__1 this was long after the passage of the fourteenth amendment in   which granted citizenship to african americans but not  the supreme court decided in elk v wilkins     to native americans  elk v wilkins    us
__label__0 white women had been citizens of the united states since its very beginning even though they were not granted the full rights of citizenship
__label__0 furthermore  native americans are the only group of americans who were forcibly removed en masse from the lands on which they and their ancestors had lived so that others could claim this land and its resources
__label__1 the next year  in worcester v georgia  the court ruled that whites could not enter tribal lands without the tribe s permission
__label__0 white georgians  however  refused to abide by the court s decision  and president andrew jackson  a former indian fighter  refused to enforce it  francis paul prucha
__label__0 reservation land was usually poor  however  and attempts to farm or raise livestock  not traditional occupations for most western tribes anyway  often ended in failure
__label__0 unable to feed themselves  the tribes became dependent on the bureau of indian affairs  bia  in washington  dc  for support
__label__0 protestant missionaries were allowed to  adopt  various tribes  to convert them to christianity and thus speed their assimilation
__label__0 as indians were removed from their tribal lands and increasingly saw their traditional cultures being destroyed over the course of the nineteenth century  a movement to protect their rights began to grow

__label__1 in   the indian citizenship act granted citizenship to all native americans born after its passage
__label__0 native americans born before the act took effect  who had not already become citizens as a result of the dawes severalty act or service in the army in world war i  had to wait until the nationality act of  to become citizens
__label__1 in   congress passed the indian reorganization act  which ended the division of reservation land into allotments
__label__0 alaska natives and native hawaiians suffered many of the same abuses as native americans  including loss of land and forced assimilation
__label__1 following the discovery of oil in alaska  however  the state  in an effort to gain undisputed title to oil rich land  settled the issue of alaska natives  land claims with the passage of the alaska native claims settlement act in

__label__0 in the united states  one benefit of socialization is that our political system enjoys diffuse support  which is support characterized by a high level of stability in politics  acceptance of the government as legitimate  and a common goal of preserving the system  david easton
__label__0 finally  media information presented as fact can contain covert or overt political material
__label__0 covert content is political information provided under the pretense that it is neutral
__label__0 a magazine might run a story on climate change by interviewing representatives of only one side of the policy debate and downplaying the opposing view  all without acknowledging the one  sided nature of its coverage
__label__0 it views government with suspicion  since history includes many examples of monarchs and leaders who limited citizens  rights
__label__1 today  modern liberalism focuses on equality and supports government intervention in society and the economy if it promotes equality
__label__0 liberals expect government to provide basic social and educational programs to help everyone have a chance to succeed

__label__0 a random sample consists of a limited number of people from the overall population  selected in such a way that each has an equal chance of being chosen
__label__0 in the early years of polling  telephone numbers of potential respondents were arbitrarily selected from various areas to avoid regional bias

__label__0 during presidential primary season  we see examples of the bandwagon effect  in which the media pays more attention to candidates who poll well during the fall and the first few primaries
__label__0 bill clinton was nicknamed the  comeback kid  in   after he placed second in the new hampshire primary despite accusations of adultery with gennifer flowers
__label__0 in   republican presidential candidate donald trump became the center of the media s horserace coverage
__label__0 as the field winnowed from over twenty candidates down to three  the media incessantly compared everyone else in the field to trump
__label__0 one study examined whether presidents responded to public opinion by determining how often they wrote amicus briefs and asked the court to affirm or reverse cases
__label__0 it found that the public s liberal  or non  liberal  mood had an effect  causing presidents to pursue and file briefs in different cases  stimson et al   dynamic representation   but another author found that the public s level of liberalness is ignored when conservative presidents  such as ronald reagan or george w bush  are elected and try to lead

__label__0 states also ignored instances of violence and intimidation against african americans wanting to register or vote  medvic  campaigns and elections
__label__0 the ratification of the twenty  fourth amendment in  ended poll taxes  but the passage of the voting rights act  vra  in  had a more profound effect   link
__label__0 the national commission on voting rights completed a study in september  that found state registration laws can either raise or reduce voter turnout rates  especially among citizens who are young or whose income falls below the poverty line
__label__0 states with simple voter registration had more registered citizens  tova wang and maria peralta
__label__0 oregon s example offers a possible solution to a recurring problem for states  maintaining accurate voter registration rolls

__label__0 low voter turnout has long caused the media and others to express concern and frustration
__label__1 a healthy democratic society is expected to be filled with citizens who vote regularly and participate in the electoral process
__label__1 an even smaller group is the voting  eligible population  vep   citizens eighteen and older who  whether they have registered or not  are eligible to vote because they are citizens  mentally competent  and not imprisoned

__label__0 this makes it difficult for voters juggling school  work  and child care during polling hours   link
__label__0 many states have tried to address this problem with early voting  which opens polling places as much as two weeks early
__label__0 texas opened polling places on weekdays and weekends in  and initially saw an increase in voting in gubernatorial and presidential elections  although the impact tapered off over time  stefan d haag   early voting in texas  what are the effects   austin community college cppps report  httpwwwaustincceducpppsearlyvotingfullreportpdf  november
__label__0 other states with early voting  however  showed a decline in turnout  possibly because there is less social pressure to vote when voting is spread over several days  rich morin
__label__0 another factor for potential candidates is whether the seat they are considering is competitive or open
__label__1 a competitive seat describes a race where a challenger runs against the incumbent  the current office holder
__label__1 an open seat is one whose incumbent is not running for reelection
__label__0 while these laws intended to create transparency in campaign funding  government did not have the power to stop the high levels of money entering elections  and little was done to enforce the laws
__label__1 in   congress again tried to fix the situation by passing the federal election campaign act  feca   which outlined how candidates would report all contributions and expenditures related to their campaigns
__label__1 the feca also created rules governing the way organizations and companies could contribute to federal campaigns  which allowed for the creation of political action committees  scott and mullen   thirty year report   finally  a  amendment to the act created the federal election commission  fec   which operates independently of government and enforces the elections laws
__label__0 soon after the passage of the mccain  feingold act  the fec s enforcement of the law spurred court cases challenging it
__label__1 the first  mcconnell v federal election commission     resulted in the supreme court s upholding the act s restrictions on how candidates and parties could spend campaign contributions
__label__0 but later court challenges led to the removal of limits on personal spending and ended the ban on ads run by interest groups in the days leading up to an election  court case abstracts   httpwwwfecgovlawlitigationccawshtml  november      davis v federal election commission   us
__label__1 in   the supreme court s ruling on citizens united v federal election commission led to the removal of spending limits on corporations
__label__0 despite the ease of voting using a ballot  primary elections have a number of rules and variations that can still cause confusion for citizens
__label__1 in a closed primary  only members of the political party selecting nominees may vote
__label__0 a registered green party member  for example  is not allowed to vote in the republican or democratic primary
__label__0 despite the common use of the primary system  at least five states  alaska  hawaii  idaho  colorado  and iowa  regularly use caucuses for presidential  state  and local  level nominations
__label__1 a caucus is a meeting of party members in which nominees are selected informally
__label__0 caucuses are less expensive than primaries because they rely on voting methods such as dropping marbles in a jar  placing names in a hat  standing under a sign bearing the candidate s name  or taking a voice vote
__label__0 add to this that primary and caucus voters are often more extreme in their political beliefs  and it is easy to see why fewer moderates become party nominees
__label__0 the  primary campaign by president donald trump shows that grabbing the media s attention with fiery partisan rhetoric can get a campaign started strong
__label__0 this does not guarantee a candidate will make it through the primaries  however
__label__0 newspapers and cable news programs proclaim winners and losers  and debates can change the tide of a campaign
__label__0 yet  paul begala  a strategist with bill clinton s  campaign  saw debates differently
__label__0 obama won in one congressional district and earned one electoral vote from nebraska  presidential popular vote summary for all candidates listed on at least one state ballot   httpwwwfecgovpubrecfetablespdf  november

__label__0 this electoral college voting method is referred to as the district system
__label__0 in fact  the more money a candidate raises  the more he or she will continue to raise
__label__1 emily s list  a political action group  was founded on this principle  its name is an acronym for  early money is like yeast   it makes the dough rise
__label__0 this group helps progressive women candidates gain early campaign contributions  which in turn helps them get further donations   link
__label__0 huckabee  christie  and fiorina dropped out relatively early
__label__0 democrats had to decide between hillary clinton  bernie sanders  and martin omalley  who soon dropped out
__label__0 voters must find more information about each candidate to decide which is closest to their preferred issue positions
__label__0 even before the citizens united decision allowed corporations and interest groups to run ads supporting candidates  shadow campaigns existed
__label__0 in   the swift boat veterans for truth organization ran ads attacking john kerry s military service record  and moveon attacked george w bush s decision to commit to the wars in afghanistan and iraq
__label__0 in   super pacs poured more than   million into supporting candidates  super pacs   httpswwwopensecretsorgpacssuperpacsphpcycle  november
__label__1 citizens also use party identification to make decisions via straight  ticket voting  choosing every republican or democratic party member on the ballot
__label__0 in some states  such as texas or michigan  selecting one box at the top of the ballot gives a single party all the votes on the ballot   link
__label__0 there are three forms of direct democracy used in the united states
__label__1 a referendum asks citizens to confirm or repeal a decision made by the government
__label__1 a legislative referendum occurs when a legislature passes a law or a series of constitutional amendments and presents them to the voters to ratify with a yes or no vote
__label__0 california was the first state to allow the use of medical marijuana  after the passage of proposition  in
__label__1 just a few years later  however  in gonzales v raich     the supreme court ruled that the us government had the authority to criminalize the use of marijuana
__label__0 in   attorney general eric holder said the federal government would not seek to prosecute patients using marijuana medically  citing limited resources and other priorities
__label__1 the controlled substances act  csa   passed by congress in   declares marijuana a dangerous drug and makes its sale a prosecutable act

__label__0 democratic primary candidate bernie sanders arrived in seattle on august     to give a speech at a rally to promote his presidential campaign
__label__0 instead  the rally was interrupted  and eventually co  opted  by activists for black lives matter   linkdan merica   black lives matter protesters shut down sanders event in seattle   cnn   august
__label__0 why did the group risk alienating democratic voters by preventing sanders from speaking
__label__1 because black lives matter had been trying to raise awareness of the treatment of black citizens in the united states  and the media has the power to elevate such issueshttpblacklivesmattercomabout  august
__label__0 while some questioned its tactics  the organization s move underscores how important the media are to gaining recognition  and the lengths to which organizations are willing to go to get media attention  conor friedersdorf   a conversation about black lives matter and bernie sanders   the atlantic   august
__label__1 the media also engages in agenda setting  which is the act of choosing which issues or topics deserve public discussion
__label__0 for example  in the early s  famine in ethiopia drew worldwide attention  which resulted in increased charitable giving to the country
__label__0 although newspapers united for a common cause during the revolutionary war  the divisions that occurred during the constitutional convention and the united states  early history created a change
__label__0 the publication of the federalist papers  as well as the anti  federalist papers  in the s  moved the nation into the party press era  in which partisanship and political party loyalty dominated the choice of editorial content
__label__0 one reason was cost
__label__1 in   adolph ochs purchased the new york times with the goal of creating a dignified newspaper that would provide readers with important news about the economy  politics  and the world rather than gossip and comics
__label__0 they are usually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect
__label__1 malpighian tubules are convoluted  which increases their surface area  and they are lined with microvilli for reabsorption and maintenance of osmotic balance
__label__0 malpighian tubules work cooperatively with specialized glands in the wall of the rectum
__label__0 mammals  including humans  produce urea  whereas reptiles and many terrestrial invertebrates produce uric acid
__label__1 animals that secrete urea as the primary nitrogenous waste material are called ureotelic animals
__label__0 both macrophages and dendritic cells engulf pathogens and cellular debris through phagocytosis
__label__1 a neutrophil is also a phagocytic leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens
__label__0 neutrophils  shown in  link   are the most abundant leukocytes of the immune system
__label__0 t cells and b cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes
__label__1 t cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland  and b cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow
__label__1 nk cells identify intracellular infections  especially from viruses  by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class  mhc  i molecules on the surface of infected cells
__label__0 complement proteins perform several functions
__label__1 the proteins serve as a marker to indicate the presence of a pathogen to phagocytic cells  such as macrophages and b cells  and enhance engulfment  this process is called opsonization
__label__0 certain complement proteins can combine to form attack complexes that open pores in microbial cell membranes
__label__1 an antigen is a foreign or  non  self  macromolecule that reacts with cells of the immune system
__label__0 not all antigens will provoke a response
__label__0 any individual may possess a population of t and b cells that together express a near limitless variety of antigen receptors that are capable of recognizing virtually any infecting pathogen
__label__0 t and b cells are activated when they recognize small components of antigens  called epitopes  presented by apcs  illustrated in  link
__label__0 note that recognition occurs at a specific epitope rather than on the entire antigen  for this reason  epitopes are known as  antigenic determinants   in the absence of information from apcs  t and b cells remain inactive  or nave  and are unable to prepare an immune response
__label__0 when stimulated by the th pathway  nave b cells differentiate into antibody  secreting plasma cells
__label__1 a plasma cell is an immune cell that secrets antibodies  these cells arise from b cells that were stimulated by antigens
__label__1 similar to t cells  nave b cells initially are coated in thousands of b cell receptors  bcrs   which are membrane  bound forms of ig  immunoglobulin  or an antibody
__label__1 mucosal immunity is formed by mucosa  associated lymphoid tissue  which functions independently of the systemic immune system  and which has its own innate and adaptive components
__label__1 mucosa  associated lymphoid tissue  malt   illustrated in  link   is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body
__label__0 this tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment
__label__1 the combined result of treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead
__label__0 in addition to promoting immune tolerance of harmless antigens  other subsets of treg cells are involved in the prevention of the autoimmune response  which is an inappropriate immune response to host cells or self  antigens
__label__0 another treg class suppresses immune responses to harmful pathogens after the infection has cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis
__label__1 the term avidity describes binding by antibody classes that are secreted as joined  multivalent structures  such as igm and iga
__label__0 although avidity measures the strength of binding  just as affinity does  the avidity is not simply the sum of the affinities of the antibodies in a multimeric structure
__label__1 the renin  angiotensin  aldosterone system  illustrated in  link  proceeds through several steps to produce angiotensin ii  which acts to stabilize blood pressure and volume
__label__1 renin  secreted by a part of the juxtaglomerular complex  is produced by the granular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles
__label__0 it also triggers the release of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone from the adrenal cortex  which in turn stimulates the renal tubules to reabsorb more sodium
__label__0 angiotensin ii also triggers the release of anti  diuretic hormone  adh  from the hypothalamus  leading to water retention in the kidneys
__label__0 it acts directly on the nephrons and decreases glomerular filtration rate
__label__0 failures  insufficiencies  or delays at any level of the immune response can allow pathogens or tumor cells to gain a foothold and replicate or proliferate to high enough levels that the immune system becomes overwhelmed
__label__1 immunodeficiency is the failure  insufficiency  or delay in the response of the immune system  which may be acquired or inherited
__label__0 immunodeficiency can be acquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens  such as hiv   chemical exposure  including certain medical treatments   malnutrition  or possibly by extreme stress
__label__1 autoimmunity is a type of hypersensitivity to self antigens that affects approximately five percent of the population
__label__0 most types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response
__label__1 fragmentation is the breaking of the body into two parts with subsequent regeneration
__label__0 if the animal is capable of fragmentation  and the part is big enough  a separate individual will regrow
__label__1 in viviparity the young develop within the female  receiving nourishment from the mother s blood through a placenta
__label__0 the offspring develops in the female and is born alive
__label__1 semen is a mixture of sperm and spermatic duct secretions  about  percent of the total  and fluids from accessory glands that contribute most of the semen s volume
__label__0 sperm are haploid cells  consisting of a flagellum as a tail  a neck that contains the cell s energy  producing mitochondria  and a head that contains the genetic material
__label__1 the walnut  shaped prostate gland surrounds the urethra  the connection to the urinary bladder
__label__0 it has a series of short ducts that directly connect to the urethra
__label__1 the clitoris is a structure with erectile tissue that contains a large number of sensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during intercourse
__label__1 the labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva
__label__0 the labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male
__label__1 in both sexes  the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the pituitary gland
__label__0 when the reproductive hormone is required  the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin  releasing hormone  gnrh  to the anterior pituitary
__label__0 this causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone  fsh  and luteinizing hormone  lh  from the anterior pituitary into the blood
__label__0 in addition  estrogens and progesterone are released from the developing follicles
__label__1 estrogen is the reproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth  ovulation  and calcium absorption  it is also responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females
__label__0 these include breast development  flaring of the hips  and a shorter period necessary for bone maturation
__label__0 just prior to the middle of the cycle  approximately day    the high level of estrogen causes fsh and especially lh to rise rapidly  then fall
__label__1 the spike in lh causes ovulation  the most mature follicle  like that shown in  link   ruptures and releases its egg
__label__0 the follicles that did not rupture degenerate and their eggs are lost
__label__1 in mammals  the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida
__label__0 when a sperm binds to the zona pellucida  a series of biochemical events  called the acrosomal reactions  take place
__label__1 in placental mammals  the acrosome contains digestive enzymes that initiate the degradation of the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane  as illustrated in  link  b
__label__0 in mammals  the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development
__label__0 here the cells in the blastula arrange themselves in two layers  the inner cell mass  and an outer layer called the trophoblast
__label__1 pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual
__label__0 the length of time of gestation varies among animals  but is very similar among the great apes  human gestation is  days  while chimpanzee gestation is  days  a gorilla s is  days  and orangutan gestation is  days long
__label__0 the fox has a   day gestation
__label__1 the prevention of a pregnancy comes under the terms contraception or birth control
__label__0 strictly speaking  contraception refers to preventing the sperm and egg from joining
__label__0 both terms are  however  frequently used interchangeably
__label__0 the neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called the neural tube  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 in further development  the neural tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal cord
__label__1 a population is a group of interbreeding organisms that are members of the same species living in the same area at the same time
__label__1 organisms that are all members of the same species are called conspecifics
__label__0 a population is identified  in part  by where it lives  and its area of population may have natural or artificial boundaries  natural boundaries might be rivers  mountains  or deserts  while examples of artificial boundaries include mowed grass  manmade structures  or roads
__label__0 many abiotic forces influence where life can exist and the types of organisms found in different parts of the biosphere
__label__0 the abiotic factors influence the distribution of biomes  large areas of land with similar climate  flora  and fauna
__label__0 there is little species diversity  low net primary productivity  and low aboveground biomass
__label__1 the soils of the arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred to as permafrost
__label__0 the permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the soil and slows the decay of organic matter  which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter
__label__1 the benthic realm  or zone  extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor
__label__1 within the pelagic realm is the photic zone  which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate  approximately  m or  ft
__label__1 at depths greater than  m  light can not penetrate  thus  this is referred to as the aphotic zone
__label__1 the neritic zone   link   extends from the intertidal zone to depths of about  m  or  ft  at the edge of the continental shelf
__label__0 since light can penetrate this depth  photosynthesis can occur in the neritic zone
__label__1 the deepest part of the ocean is the abyssal zone  which is at depths of  m or greater
__label__0 the abyssal zone   link   is very cold and has very high pressure  high oxygen content  and low nutrient content
__label__0 because of this  they are determining factors in the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds
__label__1 when there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus  from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms  for example   the growth of algae skyrockets  resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom
__label__0 algal blooms   link   can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water
__label__1 wetlands are different from lakes because wetlands are shallow bodies of water whereas lakes vary in depth
__label__1 emergent vegetation consists of wetland plants that are rooted in the soil but have portions of leaves  stems  and flowers extending above the water s surface
__label__0 there are several types of wetlands including marshes  swamps  bogs  mudflats  and salt marshes   link
__label__0 climate does not address the amount of rain that fell on one particular day in a biome or the colder  than  average temperatures that occurred on one day
__label__1 in contrast  weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time
__label__0 weather forecasts are usually made for hour cycles
__label__0 this occurred in  when volcanos in iceland erupted and caused the release of large volumes of sulfuric oxide
__label__1 this led to haze  effect cooling  a global phenomenon that occurs when dust  ash  or other suspended particles block out sunlight and trigger lower global temperatures as a result  haze  effect cooling usually extends for one or more years
__label__0 in europe and north america  haze  effect cooling produced some of the lowest average winter temperatures on record in  and
__label__0 another source of methane is the melting of clathrates
__label__1 clathrates are frozen chunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean
__label__0 when water warms  these chunks of ice melt and methane is released
__label__0 the study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species exist  and how closely associated they are with each other
__label__0 within a particular habitat  a population can be characterized by its population size  n   the total number of individuals  and its population density  the number of individuals within a specific area or volume
__label__0 population size and density are the two main characteristics used to describe and understand populations
__label__0 in addition to measuring simple density  further information about a population can be obtained by looking at the distribution of the individuals
__label__1 species dispersion patterns  or distribution patterns  show the spatial relationship between members of a population within a habitat at a particular point in time
__label__0 in other words  they show whether members of the species live close together or far apart  and what patterns are evident when they are spaced apart
__label__0 furthermore  some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce  lowering the growth rate
__label__1 therefore  when calculating the growth rate of a population  the death rate  d   number organisms that die during a particular time interval  is subtracted from the birth rate  b   number organisms that are born during that interval
__label__0 this is shown in the following formula
__label__0 in the real world  phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others
__label__1 the resulting competition between population members of the same species for resources is termed intraspecific competition  intra   within   specific   species
__label__0 intraspecific competition for resources may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity  resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need
__label__1 in mllerian mimicry  multiple species share the same warning coloration  but all of them actually have defenses
__label__0 link  shows a variety of foul  tasting butterflies with similar coloration
__label__1 a parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it
__label__0 in this relationship  the parasite benefits  but the organism being fed upon  the host is harmed
__label__0 the area in question could be a habitat  a biome  or the entire biosphere
__label__1 species richness is the term that is used to describe the number of species living in a habitat or biome
__label__0 species richness varies across the globe   link
__label__1 keystone speciesa keystone species is one whose presence is key to maintaining biodiversity within an ecosystem and to upholding an ecological community s structure
__label__1 the intertidal sea star  pisaster ochraceus  of the northwestern united states is a keystone species   link
__label__0 on the big island  approximately  acres of land is added each year
__label__1 first  weathering and other natural forces break down the substrate enough for the establishment of certain hearty plants and lichens with few soil requirements  known as pioneer species   link
__label__0 these species help to further break down the mineral rich lava into soil where other  less hardy species will grow and eventually replace the pioneer species
__label__1 behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus
__label__1 behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes
__label__0 the idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new
__label__0 innate or instinctual behaviors rely on response to stimuli
__label__1 the simplest example of this is a reflex action  an involuntary and rapid response to stimulus
__label__0 to test the  knee  jerk  reflex  a doctor taps the patellar tendon below the kneecap with a rubber hammer
__label__1 a fixed action pattern is a series of movements elicited by a stimulus such that even when the stimulus is removed  the pattern goes on to completion
__label__0 an example of such a behavior occurs in the three  spined stickleback  a small freshwater fish   link
__label__0 communication within a species
__label__1 animals communicate with each other using stimuli known as signals
__label__0 an example of this is seen in the three  spined stickleback  where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to become aggressive and signals females to mate
__label__0 distraction displays are seen in birds and some fish
__label__1 they are designed to attract a predator away from the nest that contains their young
__label__1 in monogamous systems  one male and one female are paired for at least one breeding season
__label__0 in some animals  such as the gray wolf  these associations can last much longer  even a lifetime
__label__1 habituation is a simple form of learning in which an animal stops responding to a stimulus after a period of repeated exposure
__label__0 this is a form of non  associative learning  as the stimulus is not associated with any punishment or reward
__label__1 in classical conditioning  a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously not been associated with  the conditioned stimulus
__label__1 the response to the original  unconditioned stimulus is called the unconditioned response
__label__1 a species  life history describes the series of events over its lifetime  such as how resources are allocated for growth  maintenance  and reproduction
__label__0 life history traits affect the life table of an organism
__label__0 single versus multiple reproductive eventssome life history traits  such as fecundity  timing of reproduction  and parental care  can be grouped together into general strategies that are used by multiple species
__label__1 semelparity occurs when a species reproduces only once during its lifetime and then dies
__label__0 such species use most of their resource budget during a single reproductive event  sacrificing their health to the point that they do not survive
__label__0 nature regulates population growth in a variety of ways
__label__1 these are grouped into density  dependent factors  in which the density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality  and density  independent factors  which influence mortality in a population regardless of population density
__label__0 note that in the former  the effect of the factor on the population depends on the density of the population at onset
__label__0 furthermore  the theory ignored the age  specific mortality of the populations which scientists now know is very important
__label__0 new demographic  based models of life history evolution have been developed which incorporate many ecological concepts included in r and k  selection theory as well as population age structure and mortality factors
__label__0 in ecology  two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems  resistance and resilience
__label__1 the ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances is called resistance
__label__1 the speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium after being disturbed  called its resilience
__label__0 there is a single path through the chain
__label__1 each organism in a food chain occupies what is called a trophic level
__label__0 depending on their role as producers or consumers  species or groups of species can be assigned to various trophic levels
__label__1 the organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores  the primary consumers
__label__1 secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers
__label__1 tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores
__label__1 a holistic model  which accounts for all the interactions between different species and their complex interconnected relationships with each other and with the environment  is a more accurate and descriptive model for ecosystems
__label__1 a food web is a graphic representation of a holistic  non  linear web of primary producers  primary consumers  and higher  level consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics   link
__label__1 the study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment  disturbances  or by internal forces is called ecosystem dynamics
__label__0 ecosystems are characterized using a variety of research methodologies
__label__0 three basic types of ecosystem modeling are routinely used in research and ecosystem management  a conceptual model  an analytical model  and a simulation model
__label__1 a conceptual model is an ecosystem model that consists of flow charts to show interactions of different compartments of the living and nonliving components of the ecosystem
__label__0 a conceptual model describes ecosystem structure and dynamics and shows how environmental disturbances affect the ecosystem  however  its ability to predict the effects of these disturbances is limited
__label__1 chemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available  such as in those associated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean   link
__label__0 many chemoautotrophs in hydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide  hs   which is released from the vents as a source of chemical energy
__label__0 in this ecosystem  the total energy accumulated by the primary producers  gross primary productivity  was shown to be  kcal  m  yr  because all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions  like respiration and resulting metabolic heat loss  scientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem
__label__1 net primary productivity is the energy that remains in the primary producers after accounting for the organisms  respiration and heat loss
__label__0 the net productivity is then available to the primary consumers at the next trophic level
__label__1 net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level
__label__1 assimilation is the biomass  energy content generated per unit area  of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food  energy used for respiration  and energy lost as waste
__label__1 assimilation is the biomass  energy content generated per unit area  of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food  energy used for respiration  and energy lost as waste
__label__1 incomplete ingestion refers to the fact that some consumers eat only a part of their food
__label__0 geologic processes  such as weathering  erosion  water drainage  and the subduction of the continental plates  all play a role in this recycling of materials
__label__1 because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of this process  the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their environment is called a biogeochemical cycle
__label__0 fossil fuels are considered a non  renewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation
__label__1 a non  renewable resource  such as fossil fuel  is either regenerated very slowly or not at all
__label__0 another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land  including land beneath the surface of the ocean  by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems
__label__1 a dead zone is an area within a freshwater or marine ecosystem where large areas are depleted of their normal flora and fauna  these zones can be caused by eutrophication  oil spills  dumping of toxic chemicals  and other human activities
__label__0 the number of dead zones has been increasing for several years  and more than  of these zones were present as of
__label__1 traditionally  ecologists have measured biodiversity  a general term for the variety present in the biosphere  by taking into account both the number of species and their commonness
__label__0 biodiversity can be estimated at a number of levels of organization of living things
__label__0 genetic diversity is one of those alternate concepts
__label__1 genetic diversity or variation is the raw material for adaptation in a species
__label__0 all of these species were found only in lake victoria  therefore  the  species of cichlids were endemic
__label__1 endemic species are found in only one location
__label__0 endemics with highly restricted distributions are particularly vulnerable to extinction
__label__0 the pleistocene extinction is one of the lesser extinctions  and a recent one
__label__0 it is well known that the north american  and to some degree eurasian  megafauna  or large animals  disappeared toward the end of the last glaciation period
__label__0 the extinction appears to have happened in a relatively restricted time period of    years ago
__label__0 contemporary societies that live close to the land often have a broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area
__label__1 most plants produce secondary plant compounds  which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them  but some of which also work as medication
__label__0 for centuries in europe  older knowledge about the medical uses of plants was compiled in herbals  books that identified plants and their uses
__label__1 exotic species are species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans into an ecosystem in which they did not evolve
__label__0 such introductions likely occur frequently as natural phenomena
__label__0 the technology of molecular genetics and data processing and storage are maturing to the point where cataloguing the planet s species in an accessible way is close to feasible
__label__1 dna barcoding is one molecular genetic method  which takes advantage of rapid evolution in a mitochondrial gene present in eukaryotes  excepting the plants  to identify species using the sequence of portions of the gene
__label__0 science includes such diverse fields as astronomy  biology  computer sciences  geology  logic  physics  chemistry  and mathematics   link
__label__1 however  those fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes are considered natural sciences
__label__0 thus  a museum of natural sciences might contain any of the items listed above
__label__0 in deductive reason  the pattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning
__label__1 deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to forecast specific results
__label__0 from those general principles  a scientist can extrapolate and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid
__label__0 each experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls
__label__1 a variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment
__label__1 the control group contains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that is hypothesized about
__label__1 in contrast  applied science or  technology   aims to use science to solve real  world problems  making it possible  for example  to improve a crop yield  find a cure for a particular disease  or save animals threatened by a natural disaster   link
__label__0 in applied science  the problem is usually defined for the researcher
__label__0 this structure is sometimes called the  imrad  format
__label__1 there are usually acknowledgment and reference sections as well as an abstract  a concise summary  at the beginning of the paper
__label__1 there are usually acknowledgment and reference sections as well as an abstract  a concise summary  at the beginning of the paper
__label__0 there might be additional sections depending on the type of paper and the journal where it will be published  for example  some review papers require an outline
__label__0 the materials and methods section includes a complete and accurate description of the substances used  and the method and techniques used by the researchers to gather data
__label__0 the description should be thorough enough to allow another researcher to repeat the experiment and obtain similar results  but it does not have to be verbose
__label__1 finally  the conclusion section summarizes the importance of the experimental findings
__label__0 while the scientific paper almost certainly answered one or more scientific questions that were stated  any good research should lead to more questions
__label__1 some cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes  these are called organelles
__label__0 organelles are small structures that exist within cells
__label__1 in larger organisms  cells combine to make tissues  which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions
__label__1 organs are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function
__label__1 for instance  the circulatory system transports blood through the body and to and from the lungs  it includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels
__label__1 organisms are individual living entities
__label__0 for example  each tree in a forest is an organism
__label__0 the evolution of various life forms on earth can be summarized in a phylogenetic tree   link
__label__1 a phylogenetic tree is a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both
__label__0 a phylogenetic tree is composed of nodes and branches
__label__1 another field of biological study  neurobiology  studies the biology of the nervous system  and although it is considered a branch of biology  it is also recognized as an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience
__label__0 because of its interdisciplinary nature  this subdiscipline studies different functions of the nervous system using molecular  cellular  developmental  medical  and computational approaches
__label__1 an atom is composed of two regions  the nucleus  which is in the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons  and the outermost region of the atom which holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 atoms contain protons  electrons  and neutrons  among other subatomic particles
__label__0 atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons
__label__1 the number of protons determines an element s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another
__label__0 the number of neutrons is variable  resulting in isotopes  which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess
__label__0 isotopes
__label__1 isotopes are different forms of an element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons
__label__0 some elements  such as carbon  potassium  and uranium  have naturally occurring isotopes
__label__0 the properties of elements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature  they may be gases  solids  or liquids
__label__1 elements also have specific chemical reactivity  the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other
__label__0 the innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight electrons
__label__1 this is known as the octet rule  which states  with the exception of the innermost shell  that atoms are more stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their valence shell  the outermost electron shell
__label__0 examples of some neutral atoms and their electron configurations are shown in  link
__label__1 chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are broken apart
__label__0 the substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants  usually found on the left side of a chemical equation   and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products  usually found on the right side of a chemical equation
__label__1 even though all of the reactants and products of this reaction are molecules  each atom remains bonded to at least one other atom   in this reaction only hydrogen peroxide and water are representatives of compounds  they contain atoms of more than one type of element
__label__0 molecular oxygen  on the other hand  as shown in  link   consists of two doubly bonded oxygen atoms and is not classified as a compound but as a homonuclear molecule
__label__0 the oxygen atoms in an o molecule are joined by a double bond
__label__1 in reversible reactions  reactants are turned into products  but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold  characteristic of the particular reaction   some of these products will be converted back into reactants  at this point  the designations of products and reactants are reversed
__label__1 this back and forth continues until a certain relative balance between reactants and products occurs  a state called equilibrium
__label__0 these situations of reversible reactions are often denoted by a chemical equation with a double headed arrow pointing towards both the reactants and products
__label__1 negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions
__label__0 anions are designated by their elemental name being altered to end in  ide   the anion of chlorine is called chloride  and the anion of sulfur is called sulfide  for example
__label__1 certain salts are referred to in physiology as electrolytes  including sodium  potassium  and calcium   ions necessary for nerve impulse conduction  muscle contractions and water balance
__label__0 many sports drinks and dietary supplements provide these ions to replace those lost from the body via sweating during exercise
__label__0 this occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen s electrons
__label__0 thus oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms  giving the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges  respectively
__label__0 another way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus
__label__0 individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken  however  they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers  creating a major force in combination
__label__1 hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the dna double helix  like hydrogen bonds  van der waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules
__label__0 van der waals attractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities  which are not always symmetrical around an atom
__label__0 water s high heat capacity is a property caused by hydrogen bonding among water molecules
__label__0 water has the highest specific heat capacity of any liquids
__label__1 specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree celsius
__label__0 eventually  as water reaches its boiling point of   celsius    fahrenheit   the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules  and the kinetic energy  motion  between the water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas
__label__1 even when below its boiling point  water s individual molecules acquire enough energy from other water molecules such that some surface water molecules can escape and vaporize  this process is known as evaporation
__label__0 before it overflows  the water forms a dome  like shape above the rim of the glass
__label__0 this water can stay above the glass because of the property of cohesion
__label__1 in cohesion  water molecules are attracted to each other  because of hydrogen bonding   keeping the molecules together at the liquid  gas  water  air  interface  although there is no more room in the glass
__label__1 this is because the water molecules are attracted to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are to each other and therefore adhere to it
__label__0 this type of adhesion is called capillary action  and is illustrated in  link
__label__0 cells are made of many complex molecules called macromolecules  such as proteins  nucleic acids  rna and dna   carbohydrates  and lipids
__label__1 the macromolecules are a subset of organic molecules  any carbon  containing liquid  solid  or gas  that are especially important for life
__label__0 the fundamental component for all of these macromolecules is carbon
__label__1 so far  the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been aliphatic hydrocarbons  which consist of linear chains of carbon atoms
__label__1 another type of hydrocarbon  aromatic hydrocarbons  consists of closed rings of carbon atoms
__label__0 ring structures are found in hydrocarbons  sometimes with the presence of double bonds  which can be seen by comparing the structure of cyclohexane to benzene in  link
__label__0 structural isomers  like butane and isobutene shown in  link  a  differ in the placement of their covalent bonds  both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens  ch   but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties
__label__0 for example  due to their different chemical properties  butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches  whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans
__label__0 geometric isomers  on the other hand  have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the surrounding atoms  especially in carbon  to  carbon double bonds
__label__0 in the simple molecule butene  ch   the two methyl groups  ch  can be on either side of the double covalent bond central to the molecule  as illustrated in  link  b
__label__0 this carbon backbone is formed by chains andor rings of carbon atoms with the occasional substitution of an element such as nitrogen or oxygen
__label__1 molecules with other elements in their carbon backbone are substituted hydrocarbons
__label__1 most macromolecules are made from single subunits  or building blocks  called monomers
__label__1 the monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers
__label__0 the monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers
__label__0 in doing so  monomers release water molecules as byproducts
__label__0 carbohydrates are  in fact  an essential part of our diet  grains  fruits  and vegetables are all natural sources of carbohydrates
__label__0 carbohydrates provide energy to the body  particularly through glucose  a simple sugar that is a component of starch and an ingredient in many staple foods
__label__0 carbohydrates also have other important functions in humans  animals  and plants
__label__1 disaccharides  di   two   form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction  also known as a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis
__label__0 during this process  the hydroxyl group of one monosaccharide combines with the hydrogen of another monosaccharide  releasing a molecule of water and forming a covalent bond
__label__0 lipids include a diverse group of compounds that are largely nonpolar in nature
__label__0 this is because they are hydrocarbons that include mostly nonpolar carbon  carbon or carbon  hydrogen bonds
__label__1 when the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond  the fatty acid is said to be unsaturated
__label__0 oleic acid is an example of an unsaturated fatty acid   link
__label__0 wax covers the feathers of some aquatic birds and the leaf surfaces of some plants
__label__1 because of the hydrophobic nature of waxes  they prevent water from sticking on the surface   link
__label__1 proteins are one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range of functions of all macromolecules
__label__0 proteins may be structural  regulatory  contractile  or protective  they may serve in transport  storage  or membranes  or they may be toxins or enzymes
__label__0 protein shape is critical to its function  and this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds
__label__1 changes in temperature  ph  and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein  leading to loss of function  known as denaturation
__label__0 all proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same  types of amino acids
__label__1 the unique sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure
__label__0 for example  the pancreatic hormone insulin has two polypeptide chains  a and b  and they are linked together by disulfide bonds
__label__1 the unique three  dimensional structure of a polypeptide is its tertiary structure   link
__label__0 this structure is in part due to chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain
__label__0 nucleic acids are the most important macromolecules for the continuity of life
__label__1 they carry the genetic blueprint of a cell and carry instructions for the functioning of the cell
__label__0 the primary structure of a purine is two carbon  nitrogen rings
__label__1 cytosine  thymine  and uracil are classified as pyrimidines which have a single carbon  nitrogen ring as their primary structure   link
__label__0 each of these basic carbon  nitrogen rings has different functional groups attached to it
__label__0 to give you a sense of cell size  a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a meter or eight micrometers  abbreviated as eight m  in diameter  the head of a pin of is about two thousandths of a meter  two mm  in diameter
__label__0 that means about  red blood cells could fit on the head of a pin
__label__0 most student microscopes are classified as light microscopes   linka
__label__1 visible light passes and is bent through the lens system to enable the user to see the specimen
__label__1 like prokaryotes  eukaryotic cells have a plasma membrane   link    a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins that separates the internal contents of the cell from its surrounding environment
__label__1 a phospholipid is a lipid molecule with two fatty acid chains and a phosphate  containing group
__label__0 typically  the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell   link
__label__1 the nucleus  plural  nuclei  houses the cell s dna and directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins
__label__0 let s look at it in more detail   link
__label__0 chromatin and chromosomesto understand chromatin  it is helpful to first consider chromosomes
__label__1 chromosomes are structures within the nucleus that are made up of dna  the hereditary material
__label__0 you may remember that in prokaryotes  dna is organized into a single circular chromosome
__label__1 ribosomes are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis
__label__1 when viewed through an electron microscope  ribosomes appear either as clusters  polyribosomes  or single  tiny dots that float freely in the cytoplasm
__label__0 if you look at  link  b  you will see that plant cells each have a large central vacuole that occupies most of the area of the cell
__label__1 the central vacuole plays a key role in regulating the cell s concentration of water in changing environmental conditions
__label__0 have you ever noticed that if you forget to water a plant for a few days  it wilts
__label__0 intermediate filaments have no role in cell movement
__label__0 their function is purely structural
__label__0 when present  the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella
__label__0 when cilia  singular  cilium  are present  however  many of them extend along the entire surface of the plasma membrane
__label__1 they are short  hair  like structures that are used to move entire cells  such as paramecia  or substances along the outer surface of the cell  for example  the cilia of cells lining the fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus  or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that trap particulate matter and move it toward your nostrils
__label__1 a tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells   link
__label__0 the cells are held tightly against each other by proteins  predominantly two proteins called claudins and occludins
__label__0 tight junctions form watertight connections between adjacent animal cells
__label__0 the explanation proposed by singer and nicolson is called the fluid mosaic model
__label__0 the model has evolved somewhat over time  but it still best accounts for the structure and functions of the plasma membrane as we now understand them
__label__1 the hydrophilic or  water  loving  areas of these molecules  which look like a collection of balls in an artist s rendition of the model    link   are in contact with the aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell
__label__0 hydrophobic  or water  hating molecules  tend to be non  polar
__label__1 they interact with other non  polar molecules in chemical reactions  but generally do not interact with polar molecules
__label__1 peripheral proteins are found on the exterior and interior surfaces of membranes  attached either to integral proteins or to phospholipids
__label__0 peripheral proteins  along with integral proteins  may serve as enzymes  as structural attachments for the fibers of the cytoskeleton  or as part of the cell s recognition sites
__label__1 in passive transport  substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration
__label__1 a physical space in which there is a range of concentrations of a single substance is said to have a concentration gradient
__label__0 facilitated transport
__label__1 in facilitated transport  also called facilitated diffusion  materials diffuse across the plasma membrane with the help of membrane proteins
__label__0 a concentration gradient exists that would allow these materials to diffuse into the cell without expending cellular energy
__label__0 passage through the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the nonpolar central layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell
__label__1 aquaporins are channel proteins that allow water to pass through the membrane at a very high rate
__label__0 imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane separating the two sides or halves   link
__label__0 on both sides of the membrane the water level is the same  but there are different concentrations of a dissolved substance  or solute  that can not cross the membrane  otherwise the concentrations on each side would be balanced by the solute crossing the membrane
__label__0 if the volume of the solution on both sides of the membrane is the same  but the concentrations of solute are different  then there are different amounts of water  the solvent  on either side of the membrane
__label__0 three terms  hypotonic  isotonic  and hypertonic  are used to relate the osmolarity of a cell to the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid that contains the cells
__label__1 in a hypotonic situation  the extracellular fluid has lower osmolarity than the fluid inside the cell  and water enters the cell
__label__0 in living systems  the point of reference is always the cytoplasm  so the prefix hypo means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes  or a lower osmolarity  than the cell cytoplasm
__label__1 however  the cell membrane detaches from the wall and constricts the cytoplasm
__label__0 this is called plasmolysis
__label__0 plants lose turgor pressure in this condition and wilt   link
__label__0 the turgor pressure within a plant cell depends on the tonicity of the solution that it is bathed in
__label__0 this energy is harvested from atp generated through the cell s metabolism
__label__1 active transport mechanisms  collectively called pumps  work against electrochemical gradients
__label__0 small substances constantly pass through plasma membranes
__label__0 an important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate movement  there are three types of these proteins or transporters   link
__label__1 a uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule
__label__0 a symporter carries two different ions or molecules  both in the same direction
__label__0 an antiporter also carries two different ions or molecules  but in different directions
__label__0 all of these transporters can also transport small  uncharged organic molecules like glucose
__label__0 in preparation for phagocytosis  a portion of the inward  facing surface of the plasma membrane becomes coated with a protein called clathrin  which stabilizes this section of the membrane
__label__0 the coated portion of the membrane then extends from the body of the cell and surrounds the particle  eventually enclosing it
__label__0 a variation of pinocytosis is called potocytosis
__label__0 this process uses a coating protein  called caveolin  on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane  which performs a similar function to clathrin
__label__0 the cavities in the plasma membrane that form the vacuoles have membrane receptors and lipid rafts in addition to caveolin
__label__0 scientists use the term bioenergetics to discuss the concept of energy flow   link   through living systems  such as cells
__label__0 cellular processes such as the building and breaking down of complex molecules occur through stepwise chemical reactions
__label__0 the breakdown of sugars illustrates how a single molecule of glucose can store enough energy to make a great deal of atp   to  molecules
__label__0 this is a catabolic pathway
__label__1 catabolic pathways involve the degradation  or breakdown  of complex molecules into simpler ones
__label__0 the more energy that is lost by a system to its surroundings  the less ordered and more random the system is
__label__1 scientists refer to the measure of randomness or disorder within a system as entropy
__label__0 high entropy means high disorder and low energy   link
__label__0 this is because these bonds can release energy when broken
__label__1 the type of potential energy that exists within chemical bonds  and is released when those bonds are broken  is called chemical energy   link
__label__0 chemical energy is responsible for providing living cells with energy from food
__label__0 a negative g also means that the products of the reaction have less free energy than the reactants  because they gave off some free energy during the reaction
__label__1 reactions that have a negative g and consequently release free energy are called exergonic reactions
__label__1 think  exergonic means energy is exiting the system
__label__0 a small energy input is required to achieve this contorted state
__label__0 this contorted state is called the transition state  and it is a high  energy  unstable state
__label__0 for this reason  reactant molecules do nt last long in their transition state  but very quickly proceed to the next steps of the chemical reaction
__label__0 however  not all bonds within this molecule exist in a particularly high  energy state
__label__1 both bonds that link the phosphates are equally high  energy bonds  phosphoanhydride bonds  that  when broken  release sufficient energy to power a variety of cellular reactions and processes
__label__0 these high  energy bonds are the bonds between the second and third  or beta and gamma  phosphate groups and between the first and second phosphate groups
__label__0 however  increasing or decreasing the temperature outside of an optimal range can affect chemical bonds within the active site in such a way that they are less well suited to bind substrates
__label__1 high temperatures will eventually cause enzymes  like other biological molecules  to denature  a process that changes the natural properties of a substance
__label__0 likewise  the ph of the local environment can also affect enzyme function
__label__1 some inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change that reduces the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate
__label__0 this type of inhibition is called allosteric inhibition   link
__label__0 most allosterically regulated enzymes are made up of more than one polypeptide  meaning that they have more than one protein subunit
__label__1 an oxidation reaction strips an electron from an atom in a compound  and the addition of this electron to another compound is a reduction reaction
__label__0 because oxidation and reduction usually occur together  these pairs of reactions are called oxidation reduction reactions  or redox reactions  electrons and energy
__label__1 a phosphate group is removed from an intermediate reactant in the pathway  and the free energy of the reaction is used to add the third phosphate to an available adp molecule  producing atp   link
__label__0 this very direct method of phosphorylation is called substrate  level phosphorylation
__label__0 you have read that nearly all of the energy used by living cells comes to them in the bonds of the sugar  glucose
__label__1 glycolysis is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism
__label__0 nearly all living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism
__label__0 in the second step of glycolysis  an isomerase converts glucosephosphate into one of its isomers  fructosephosphate
__label__1 an isomerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule into one of its isomers
__label__0 this change from phosphoglucose to phosphofructose allows the eventual split of the sugar into two three  carbon molecules
__label__1 in the presence of oxygen  acetyl coa delivers its acetyl group to a four  carbon molecule  oxaloacetate  to form citrate  a six  carbon molecule with three carboxyl groups  this pathway will harvest the remainder of the extractable energy from what began as a glucose molecule
__label__0 this single pathway is called by different names  the citric acid cycle  for the first intermediate formed  citric acid  or citrate  when acetate joins to the oxaloacetate   the tca cycle  since citric acid or citrate and isocitrate are tricarboxylic acids   and the krebs cycle  after hans krebs  who first identified the steps in the pathway in the s in pigeon flight muscles
__label__0 the rough endoplasmic reticulum  rer  is so named because the ribosomes attached to its cytoplasmic surface give it a studded appearance when viewed through an electron microscope   link
__label__0 fmn  which is derived from vitamin b  also called riboflavin  is one of several prosthetic groups or co  factors in the electron transport chain
__label__1 a prosthetic group is a non  protein molecule required for the activity of a protein
__label__1 prosthetic groups are organic or inorganic  non  peptide molecules bound to a protein that facilitate its function  prosthetic groups include co  enzymes  which are the prosthetic groups of enzymes
__label__0 some living systems use an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor
__label__1 processes that use an organic molecule to regenerate nad from nadh are collectively referred to as fermentation
__label__0 in contrast  some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor
__label__1 because they use light to manufacture their own food  they are called photoautotrophs  literally   self  feeders using light
__label__1 other organisms  such as animals  fungi  and most other bacteria  are termed heterotrophs   other feeders    because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs
__label__1 a third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars  not by using sunlight s energy  but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds  hence  they are referred to as chemoautotrophs
__label__0 the process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll
__label__1 the gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small  regulated openings called stomata  singular  stoma   which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance
__label__0 the stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf  which helps to minimize water loss
__label__0 within the chloroplast are stacked  disc  shaped structures called thylakoids
__label__1 embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll  a pigment  molecule that absorbs light  responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material  and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain
__label__0 the thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen
__label__0 photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages  the light  dependent reactions and the light independent  reactions
__label__1 in the light  dependent reactions  energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy
__label__1 in the light  independent reactions  the chemical energy harvested during the light  dependent reactions drive the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide
__label__0 scientists differentiate the various types of radiant energy from the sun within the electromagnetic spectrum
__label__1 the electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of radiation   link
