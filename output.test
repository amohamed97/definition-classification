__label__0 5739 . Sociologists identify different types of families based on how one enters into them .
__label__1 A family of orientation refers to the family into which a person is born .
__label__1 A family of procreation describes one that is formed through marriage .
__label__1 5745 . Polygyny refers to a man being married to more than one woman at the same time .
__label__1 The reverse , when a woman is married to more than one man at the same time , is called polyandry .
__label__0 It is far less common and only occurs in about 1 percent of the world ’s cultures ( Altman and Ginat 1996 ) .
__label__0 5748 . This pattern of tracing kinship is called bilateral descent .
__label__1 Note that kinship , or one ’s traceable ancestry , can be based on blood or marriage or adoption .
__label__0 Sixty percent of societies , mostly modernized nations , follow a bilateral descent pattern .
__label__0 5754 . While sociologists use the family life cycle to study the dynamics of family over time , consumer and marketing researchers have used it to determine what goods and services families need as they progress through each stage ( Murphy and Staples 1979) .
__label__0 As early “ stage ” theories have been criticized for generalizing family life and not accounting for differences in gender , ethnicity , culture , and lifestyle , less rigid models of the family life cycle have been developed .
__label__1 One example is the family life course , which recognizes the events that occur in the lives of families but views them as parting terms of a fluid course rather than in consecutive stages ( Strong and DeVault 1992 ) .
__label__0 This type of model accounts for changes in family development , such as the fact that in today ’s society , childbearing does not always occur with marriage .
__label__1 5766 . A denomination is a large , mainstream religious organization , but it does not claim to be official or state sponsored .
__label__0 It is one religion among many .
__label__1 5784 . This story illustrates a growing concern referred to as grade inflation — a term used to describe the observation that the correspondence between letter grades and the achievements they reflect has been changing ( in a downward direction ) over time .
__label__0 Put simply , what used to be considered C - level , or average , now often earns a student a B , or even an A .
__label__0 2117 . Europe ’s feudal society was a mutually supportive system .
__label__1 The lords owned the land ; knights gave military service to a lord and carried out his justice ; serfs worked the land in return for the protection offered by the lord ’s castle or the walls of his city , into which they fled in times of danger from invaders .
__label__0 2132 . Huge storehouses were filled with food for times of need .
__label__1 Each peasant also worked for the Inca ruler a number of days per month on public works projects , a requirement known as the mita .
__label__0 For example , peasants constructed rope bridges made of grass to span the mountains above fast - flowing icy rivers .
__label__0 2159 . In reality , the encomienda system exploited native workers .
__label__1 It was eventually replaced by another colonial labor system , the repartimiento , which required Indian towns to supply a pool of labor for Spanish overlords .
__label__1 2219 . Conservative Whigs believed in government by a patrician class , a ruling group composed of a small number of privileged families .
__label__1 Conservative Whigs believed in government by a patrician class , a ruling group composed of a small number of privileged families .
__label__1 Radical Whigs favored broadening the popular participation in political life and pushed for democracy .
__label__0 The great debate after independence was secured centered on this question : Who should rule in the new American republic ?
__label__0 2246 . For $ 15 million — a bargain price , considering the amount of land involved — the United States doubled in size .
__label__1 Perhaps the greatest real estate deal in American history , the Louisiana Purchase greatly enhanced the Jeffersonian vision of the United States as an agrarian republic in which yeomen farmers worked the land .
__label__0 Jefferson also wanted to bolster trade in the West , seeing the port of New Orleans and the Mississippi River ( then the western boundary of the United States ) as crucial to American agricultural commerce .
__label__1 2252 . Specialization meant the work was broken down into specific tasks , and workers repeatedly did the one task assigned to them in the course of a day .
__label__0 As machines took over labor from humans and people increasingly found themselves confined to the same repetitive step , the process of deskilling began .
__label__0 2312 . In 1855 , Tennessee - born William Walker , along with an army of no more than sixty mercenaries , gained control of the Central American nation of Nicaragua .
__label__0 Previously , Walker had launched a successful invasion of Mexico , dubbing his conquered land the Republic of Sonora .
__label__0 In a relatively short period of time , Walker was dislodged from Sonora by Mexican authorities and forced to retreat back to the United States .
__label__1 2402 . State and federal challenges arose , due to the obvious appearance of a monopoly , which implied sole ownership of all enterprises composing an entire industry .
__label__0 When the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that the Standard Oil Company must dissolve , as its monopoly control over all refining operations in the U.S. was in violation of state and federal statutes , Rockefeller shifted to yet another legal entity , called a holding company model .
__label__1 The holding company model created a central corporate entity that controlled the operations of multiple companies by holding the majority of stock for each enterprise .
__label__0 6433 . The line between the people ’s right to know and national security is not always clear .
__label__0 In 1971 , the Supreme Court heard the Pentagon Papers case , in which the U.S. government sued the New York Times and the Washington Post to stop the release of information from a classified study of the Vietnam War .
__label__0 The Supreme Court ruled that while the government can impose prior restraint on the media , meaning the government can prevent the publication of information , that right is very limited .
__label__0 6445 . During the Civil War , journalists expected to have access to those representing the government , including the military .
__label__0 But William Tecumseh Sherman , a Union general , maintained distance between the press and his military .
__label__0 Following the publication of material Sherman believed to be protected by government censorship , a journalist was arrested and nearly put to death .
__label__0 6448 . Because White House limitations on the press are not unusual , many journalists rely on confidential sources .
__label__0 In 1972 , under the cloak of anonymity , the associate director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , Mark Felt , became a news source for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein , political reporters at the Washington Post .
__label__0 Felt provided information about a number of potential stories and was Woodward ’s main source for information about President Richard Nixon ’s involvement in a series of illegal activities , including the break - in at Democratic Party headquarters in Washington ’s Watergate office complex .
__label__0 6466 . 6565 .
__label__0 Some view the iron triangle idea as outdated .
__label__0 Hugh Heclo of George Mason University has sketched a more open pattern he calls an issue network that includes a number of different interests and political actors that work together in support of a single issue or policy .
__label__0 Hugh Heclo . 1984 .
__label__0 7020 . President Barack Obama ( second from left ) with Vice President Joe Biden ( far left ) , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ( second from right ) , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates ( far right ) , and other national security advisers in the Situation Room of the White House , watching the successful raid on Osama bin Laden ’s compound on May 1 , 2011 .
__label__1 7050 . The secretary of state is the nation ’s chief diplomat , serves in the president ’s cabinet , and oversees the Foreign Service .
__label__1 The secretary of defense , who is the civilian ( nonmilitary ) head of the armed services housed in the Department of Defense , is also a key cabinet member for foreign policy ( as mentioned above ) .
__label__0 A third cabinet secretary , the secretary of homeland security , is critically important in foreign policy , overseeing the massive Department of Homeland Security ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 7065 . In the twenty - first century , neo - isolationism means distancing the United States from the United Nations and other international organizations that get in the way .
__label__1 The strategy of selective engagement — retaining a strong military presence and remaining engaged across the world through alliances and formal installations — is used to protect the national security interests of the United States .
__label__0 However , this strategy also seeks to avoid being the world ’s policeman .
__label__0 7086 . Its goal was to unite gay men who otherwise lived in secrecy and to fight against abuse .
__label__1 The Mattachine Society often worked with the Daughters of Bilitis , a lesbian rights organization .
__label__0 Among the early issues targeted by the Mattachine Society was police entrapment of male homosexuals .
__label__0 See Vern L. Bullough .
__label__1 4229 . Other delusions include the belief that one ’s thoughts are being removed ( thought withdrawal ) or thoughts have been placed inside one ’s head ( thought insertion ) .
__label__1 Another type of delusion is somatic delusion , which is the belief that something highly abnormal is happening to one ’s body ( e.g. , that one ’s kidneys are being eaten by cockroaches ) .
__label__1 4265 . People with obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) experience thoughts and urges that are intrusive and unwanted ( obsessions ) and/or the need to engage in repetitive behaviors or mental acts ( compulsions ) .
__label__0 A person with this disorder might , for example , spend hours each day washing his hands or constantly checking and rechecking to make sure that a stove , faucet , or light has been turned off .
__label__0 4274 . Specific phobias are common ; in the United States , around 12.5 % of the population will meet the criteria for a specific phobia at some point in their lifetime ( Kessler et al. , 2005 ) .
__label__0 One type of phobia , agoraphobia , is listed in the DSM-5 as a separate anxiety disorder .
__label__1 Agoraphobia , which literally means “ fear of the marketplace , ” is characterized by intense fear , anxiety , and avoidance of situations in which it might be difficult to escape or receive help if one experiences symptoms of a panic attack ( a state of extreme anxiety that we will discuss shortly ) .
__label__0 2134 . Indeed , England could not commit to large - scale colonization in the Americas as long as Spain appeared ready to invade Ireland or Scotland .
__label__1 Nonetheless , Elizabeth approved of English privateers , sea captains to whom the home government had given permission to raid the enemy at will .
__label__0 These skilled mariners cruised the Caribbean , plundering Spanish ships whenever they could .
__label__0 2191 . Parliament did not enact the Tea Act of 1773 in order to punish the colonists , assert parliamentary power , or even raise revenues .
__label__0 Rather , the act was a straightforward order of economic protectionism for a British tea firm , the East India Company , that was on the verge of bankruptcy .
__label__1 2257 . During the War of 1812 , the Bank of the United States had suspended payments in specie , “ hard money ” usually in the form of gold and silver coins .
__label__0 When the war ended , the bank continued to issue only paper banknotes and to redeem notes issued by state banks with paper only .
__label__0 3313 . It ’s easy to get confused about two fields that study the interaction of genes and the environment , such as the fields of evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics .
__label__0 How can we tell them apart ?
__label__1 3316 . DNA is a helix - shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs .
__label__1 In each chromosome , sequences of DNA make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible characteristics , known as traits , such as eye color , hair color , and so on .
__label__1 In each chromosome , sequences of DNA make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible characteristics , known as traits , such as eye color , hair color , and so on .
__label__1 A single gene may have multiple possible variations , or alleles .
__label__1 3352 . Between signals , the neuron membrane ’s potential is held in a state of readiness , called the resting potential .
__label__1 Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action , ions line up on either side of the cell membrane , ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates ( i.e. , a sodium - potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane ) .
__label__0 Ions in high - concentration areas are ready to move to low - concentration areas , and positive ions are ready to move to areas with a negative charge . In the resting state , sodium ( Na+ ) is at higher concentrations outside the cell , so it will tend to move into the cell .
__label__0 4313 . If you look around carefully , you will see that scarcity is a fact of life .
__label__1 Scarcity means that human wants for goods , services and resources exceed what is available .
__label__0 Resources , such as labor , tools , land , and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply .
__label__1 4316 . First , specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage .
__label__0 ( In later chapters , we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage . )
__label__0 2951 . 3 times
__label__0 The distance separating the two strands that make up the DNA structure is about 1 nm , while the distance separating the individual atoms within each base is about 0.3 nm .
__label__0 One might wonder why electrostatic forces do not play a larger role in biology than they do if we have so many charged molecules .
__label__0 The reason is that the electrostatic force is “ diluted ” due to screening between molecules .
__label__0 This is due to the presence of other charges in the cell .
__label__0 2996 . A few voltage sources are shown in [ link ] .
__label__0 All such devices create a potential difference and can supply current if connected to a resistance .
__label__0 On the small scale , the potential difference creates an electric field that exerts force on charges , causing current .
__label__1 2999 . Kirchhoff ’s first rule ( the junction rule ) is an application of the conservation of charge to a junction ; it is illustrated in [ link ] .
__label__0 Current is the flow of charge , and charge is conserved ; thus , whatever charge flows into the junction must flow out .
__label__0 3128 . Thinking of the molecules as many slits , analogous to those for the oscillating ropes , we can understand why only light with a specific polarization can get through .
__label__1 The axis of a polarizing filter is the direction along which the filter passes the electric field of an EM wave ( see [ link] ) .
__label__1 The slender arrow represents a ray of unpolarized light .
__label__1 The bold arrows represent the direction of polarization of the individual waves composing the ray .
__label__1 7 . Inductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion .
__label__0 This type of reasoning is common in descriptive science .
__label__1 947 . Bilateral symmetry involves the division of the animal through a sagittal plane , resulting in two mirror image , right and left halves , such as those of a butterfly ( [ link]d ) , crab , or human body .
__label__1 Animals with bilateral symmetry have a “ head ” and “ tail ” ( anterior vs. posterior ) , front and back ( dorsal vs. ventral ) , and right and left sides ( [ link ] ) .
__label__1 1213 . Soil particles that are 0.1 to 2 mm in diameter are sand .
__label__1 Soil particles between 0.002 and 0.1 mm are called silt , and even smaller particles , less than 0.002 mm in diameter , are called clay .
__label__1 Some soils have no dominant particle size and contain a mixture of sand , silt , and humus ; these soils are called loams .
__label__1 1264 . As the seed germinates , the primary root emerges , protected by the root - tip covering : the coleorhiza .
__label__1 Next , the primary shoot emerges , protected by the coleoptile : the covering of the shoot tip .
__label__0 Upon exposure to light ( i.e .
__label__0 1321 . Neural Control of ThermoregulationThe nervous system is important to thermoregulation , as illustrated in [ link ] .
__label__0 The processes of homeostasis and temperature control are centered in the hypothalamus of the advanced animal brain .
__label__0 1336 . A large part of digestion occurs in the stomach , shown in [ link ] .
__label__1 The stomach is a saclike organ that secretes gastric digestive juices .
__label__0 The pH in the stomach is between 1.5 and 2.5 .
__label__0 4320 . It should be clear by now that economics covers a lot of ground .
__label__1 That ground can be divided into two parts : Microeconomics focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy , like households , workers , and businesses ; Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole .
__label__0 It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production , the number of unemployed people , the inflationary increase in prices , government deficits , and levels of exports and imports .
__label__0 4329 . Command economies are very different .
__label__1 In a command economy , economic effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class .
__label__0 Ancient Egypt was a good example : a large part of economic life was devoted to building pyramids , like those shown in [ link ] , for the pharaohs .
__label__1 4404 . Economists use the term demand to refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price .
__label__0 Demand is based on needs and wants — a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want , but from an economist ’s perspective they are the same thing .
__label__0 4446 . The simplest example of a rate of return is the interest rate .
__label__0 For example , when you supply money into a savings account at a bank , you receive interest on your deposit .
__label__0 4467 . The decision - making process of a utility - maximizing household applies to what quantity of hours to work in much the same way that it applies to purchases of goods and services .
__label__0 Choices made along the labor - leisure budget constraint , as wages shift , provide the logical underpinning for the labor supply curve .
__label__0 The discussion also offers some insights about the range of possible reactions when people receive higher wages , and specifically about the claim that if people are paid higher wages , they will work a greater quantity of hours — assuming that they have a say in the matter .
__label__0 5809 . Similarly , Adam Smith , a Scottish philosopher who was born nineteen years after Locke ’s death , believed that all people should be free to acquire property in any way that they wished .
__label__0 Instead of being controlled by government , business , and industry , Smith argued , people should be allowed to operate as they wish and keep the proceeds of their work .
__label__1 5815 . Government also performs the important job of protecting common goods : goods that all people may use free of charge but that are of limited supply , such as fish in the sea or clean drinking water .
__label__0 Because everyone can use these goods , they must be protected so a few people do not take everything that is available and leave others with nothing .
__label__0 5824 . Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature .
__label__1 Under totalitarianism , the government is more important than the citizens , and it controls all aspects of citizens ’ lives .
__label__0 Citizens ’ rights are limited , and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition .
__label__0 6752 . In 1803 , the Supreme Court declared for itself the power of judicial review , a power to which Hamilton had referred but that is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution .
__label__1 Judicial review is the power of the courts , as part of the system of checks and balances , to look at actions taken by the other branches of government and the states and determine whether they are constitutional .
__label__0 6758 . Consider health care , for example .
__label__0 In 2010 , President Barack Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , a statute that brought significant changes to the nation ’s healthcare system .
__label__0 With its goal of providing more widely attainable and affordable health insurance and health care , “ Obamacare ” was hailed by some but soundly denounced by others as bad policy .
__label__0 6770 . The judiciary today continues as a dual court system , with courts at both the national and state levels .
__label__0 Both levels have three basic tiers consisting of trial courts , appellate courts , and finally courts of last resort , typically called supreme courts , at the top ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 6779 . Decisions of the higher courts are binding on the lower courts .
__label__0 The precedent set by each ruling , particularly by the Supreme Court ’s decisions , both builds on principles and guidelines set by earlier cases and frames the ongoing operation of the courts , steering the direction of the entire system .
__label__0 Reliance on precedent has enabled the federal courts to operate with logic and consistency that has helped validate their role as the key interpreters of the Constitution and the law — a legitimacy particularly vital in the United States where citizens do not elect federal judges and justices but are still subject to their rulings .
__label__0 6785 . The circuit courts started out as the trial courts for most federal criminal cases and for some civil suits , including those initiated by the United States and those involving citizens of different states .
__label__0 But early on , they did not have their own judges ; the local district judge and two Supreme Court justices formed each circuit court panel .

__label__0 The president ’s nominee is then discussed ( and sometimes hotly debated ) in the Senate Judiciary Committee .
__label__0 After a committee vote , the candidate must be confirmed by a majority vote of the full Senate .
__label__0 6800 . And even on the present - day court , Anthony Kennedy , a Reagan appointee , has become notorious as the Court ’s swing vote , sometimes siding with the more conservative justices but sometimes not .
__label__0 Current chief justice John Roberts , though most typically an ardent member of the Court ’s more conservative wing , has twice voted to uphold provisions of the Affordable Care Act .
__label__0 6806 . Sandra Day O’Connor ( 1981 )
__label__1 6878 . In addition , approximately 30 percent of governors have the power of an amendatory veto , which allows them to send a bill back to the legislature and request a specific amendment to it .
__label__1 Finally , a small number of governors , including the governor of Texas , also have the power of a reduction veto , which allows them to reduce the budget proposed in a piece of legislation .
__label__0 National Conference of State Legislatures . “ The Veto Process . ” In General Legislative Procedures .
__label__0 2567 . Each remained convinced that its own economic and political systems were superior to the other ’s , and the two superpowers quickly found themselves drawn into conflict .
__label__1 The decades - long struggle between them for technological and ideological supremacy became known as the Cold War .
__label__0 So called because it did not include direct military confrontation between Soviet and U.S. troops , the Cold War was fought with a variety of other weapons : espionage and surveillance , political assassinations , propaganda , and the formation of alliances with other nations .
__label__1 2570 . As Communist governments came to power elsewhere in the world , American policymakers extended their strategy of containment to what became known as the domino theory under the Eisenhower administration : Neighbors to Communist nations , so was the assumption , were likely to succumb to the same allegedly dangerous and infectious ideology .
__label__0 Like dominos toppling one another , entire regions would eventually be controlled by the Soviets .
__label__0 2576 . In keeping with his goal of a balanced budget , Eisenhower switched the emphasis in defense from larger conventional forces to greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons .
__label__1 His New Look strategy embraced nuclear “ massive retaliation , ” a plan for nuclear response to a first Soviet strike so devastating that the attackers would not be able to respond .
__label__1 His New Look strategy embraced nuclear “ massive retaliation , ” a plan for nuclear response to a first Soviet strike so devastating that the attackers would not be able to respond .
__label__0 Some labeled this approach “ Mutually Assured Destruction ” or MAD .
__label__0 2594 . Some party factions hoped to make their voices heard ; others wished to disrupt the convention altogether .
__label__1 Among them were antiwar protestors , hippies , and Yippies — members of the leftist , anarchistic Youth International Party organized by Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman — who called for the establishment of a new nation consisting of cooperative institutions to replace those currently in existence .
__label__0 To demonstrate their contempt for “ the establishment ” and the proceedings inside the hall , the Yippies nominated a pig named Pigasus for president .
__label__1 1223 . In some soils , the B horizon contains nodules or a layer of calcium carbonate .
__label__1 The C horizon , or soil base , includes the parent material , plus the organic and inorganic material that is broken down to form soil .
__label__0 The parent material may be either created in its natural place , or transported from elsewhere to its present location .
__label__0 1325 . Animals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the different foods they consume .
__label__0 The simplest example is that of a gastrovascular cavity and is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion .
__label__0 Platyhelminthes ( flatworms ) , Ctenophora ( comb jellies ) , and Cnidaria ( coral , jelly fish , and sea anemones ) use this type of digestion .
__label__1 1343 . The second part of the small intestine is called the jejunum , shown in [ link ] .
__label__0 Here , hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining .
__label__1 5627 . A class system is based on both social factors and individual achievement .
__label__1 A class consists of a set of people who share similar status with regard to factors like wealth , income , education , and occupation .
__label__0 5639 . In turn , those parents may have been raised in the lower class .
__label__0 Patterns of intergenerational mobility can reflect long - term societal changes .
__label__1 Similarly , intragenerational mobility refers to changes in a person 's social mobility over the course of his or her lifetime .
__label__0 For example , the wealth and prestige experienced by one person may be quite different from that of his or her siblings .
__label__1 Structural mobility happens when societal changes enable a whole group of people to move up or down the social class ladder .
__label__0 1926 . As women approach their mid-40s to mid-50s , their ovaries begin to lose their sensitivity to FSH and LH .
__label__1 Menstrual periods become less frequent and finally cease ; this is menopause .
__label__0 There are still eggs and potential follicles on the ovaries , but without the stimulation of FSH and LH , they will not produce a viable egg to be released .
__label__0 1977 . The first of these is the Milankovitch cycles .
__label__1 The Milankovitch cycles describe the effects of slight changes in the Earth ’s orbit on Earth ’s climate .
__label__0 The length of the Milankovitch cycles ranges between 19,000 and 100,000 years .
__label__0 2646 . In each of these situations , an object has a velocity relative to a medium ( such as a river ) and that medium has a velocity relative to an observer on solid ground .
__label__0 The velocity of the object relative to the observer is the sum of these velocity vectors , as indicated in [ link ] and [ link ] .
__label__0 2874 . Unfortunately , this is impossible .
__label__0 The second law of thermodynamics also states , with regard to using heat transfer to do work ( the second expression of the second law ) :
__label__0 2925 . You may have noticed that dogs respond to the sound of a dog whistle which produces sound out of the range of human hearing .
__label__0 Elephants are known to respond to frequencies below 20 Hz .
__label__1 The perception of frequency is called pitch .
__label__0 Most of us have excellent relative pitch , which means that we can tell whether one sound has a different frequency from another .
__label__0 2931 . ( See [ link ] . )
__label__0 In this experiment , Franklin demonstrated a connection between lightning and static electricity .
__label__0 Sparks were drawn from a key hung on a kite string during an electrical storm .
__label__0 3684 . Remember that in classical conditioning , something in the environment triggers a reflex automatically , and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus .
__label__0 Now we turn to the second type of associative learning , operant conditioning .
__label__1 In operant conditioning , organisms learn to associate a behavior and its consequence ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 3696 . Each time the rat hit the lever , a pellet of food came out .
__label__1 When an organism receives a reinforcer each time it displays a behavior , it is called continuous reinforcement .
__label__0 This reinforcement schedule is the quickest way to teach someone a behavior , and it is especially effective in training a new behavior .
__label__1 3720 . An event schema , also known as a cognitive script , is a set of behaviors that can feel like a routine .
__label__0 Think about what you do when you walk into an elevator ( [ link ] ) .
__label__1 3735 . Working backwards is a useful heuristic in which you begin solving the problem by focusing on the end result .
__label__0 Consider this example : You live in Washington , D.C. and have been invited to a wedding at 4 PM on Saturday in Philadelphia .
__label__1 2946 . Contact forces , such as between a baseball and a bat , are explained on the small scale by the interaction of the charges in atoms and molecules in close proximity .
__label__0 They interact through forces that include the Coulomb force .
__label__0 Action at a distance is a force between objects that are not close enough for their atoms to “ touch . ”
__label__0 That is , they are separated by more than a few atomic diameters .
__label__0 2952 . Polarity of Water MoleculesThe best example of this charge screening is the water molecule , represented as H2O H2O .
__label__0 Water is a strongly polar molecule .
__label__1 Its 10 electrons ( 8 from the oxygen atom and 2 from the two hydrogen atoms ) tend to remain closer to the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nuclei .
__label__0 3075 . Radar is a common application of microwaves that was first developed in World War II .
__label__0 By detecting and timing microwave echoes , radar systems can determine the distance to objects as diverse as clouds and aircraft .
__label__1 3129 . Many crystals and solutions rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through them .
__label__0 Such substances are said to be optically active .
__label__0 Examples include sugar water , insulin , and collagen ( see [ link ] ) .
__label__0 3135 . The Michelson - Morley experiment demonstrated that the speed of light in a vacuum is independent of the motion of the Earth about the Sun .
__label__0 3162 . This can be observed with a microscope for any small particles in a fluid .
__label__1 The motion is caused by the random thermal motions of fluid molecules colliding with particles in the fluid , and it is now called Brownian motion .
__label__0 ( See [ link ] . )
__label__0 3168 . [ link ] shows an energy - level diagram , a convenient way to display energy states .
__label__0 In the present discussion , we take these to be the allowed energy levels of the electron .
__label__1 951 . Triploblasts that do not develop a coelom are called acoelomates , and their mesoderm region is completely filled with tissue , although they do still have a gut cavity .
__label__0 Examples of acoelomates include animals in the phylum Platyhelminthes , also known as flatworms .
__label__1 1068 . The lepidosaurs include modern lizards , snakes , and tuataras .
__label__1 The archosaurs include modern crocodiles and alligators , and the extinct pterosaurs ( “ winged lizard ” ) and dinosaurs ( “ terrible lizard ” ) .
__label__1 Clade Dinosauria includes birds , which evolved from a branch of dinosaurs .
__label__0 Art Connection
__label__0 1074 . Squamata ( “ scaly ” ) arose in the late Permian , and extant species include lizards and snakes .
__label__0 Both are found on all continents except Antarctica .
__label__1 1101 . This arboreal heritage of primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for brachiation , or climbing and swinging through trees .
__label__1 These adaptations include , but are not limited to : 1 ) a rotating shoulder joint , 2 ) a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs , which are widely separated from fingers ( except humans ) , which allow for gripping branches , 3 ) stereoscopic vision , two overlapping fields of vision from the eyes , which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance .
__label__0 Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of most other mammals , claws that have been modified into flattened nails , typically only one offspring per pregnancy , and a trend toward holding the body upright .
__label__0 1110 . Several species evolved from the evolutionary branch that includes humans , although our species is the only surviving member .
__label__1 The term hominin is used to refer to those species that evolved after this split of the primate line , thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees .
__label__0 Hominins were predominantly bipedal and include those groups that likely gave rise to our species — including Australopithecus , Homo habilis , and Homo erectus — and those non - ancestral groups that can be considered “ cousins ” of modern humans , such as Neanderthals .
__label__0 1113 . There is considerable debate about the origins of anatomically modern humans or Homo sapiens sapiens .
__label__0 As discussed earlier , H. erectus migrated out of Africa and into Asia and Europe in the first major wave of migration about 1.5 million years ago .
__label__0 1185 . Plants can tell the time of day and time of year by sensing and using various wavelengths of sunlight .
__label__1 Phototropism is a directional response that allows plants to grow towards , or even away from , light .
__label__0 1542 . When blood glucose levels decline below normal levels , for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly during exercise , the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas .
__label__1 Glucagon raises blood glucose levels , eliciting what is called a hyperglycemic effect , by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in skeletal muscle cells and liver cells in a process called glycogenolysis .
__label__1 1623 . Some movements that can not be classified as gliding , angular , or rotational are called special movements .
__label__1 Inversion involves the soles of the feet moving inward , toward the midline of the body .
__label__1 Eversion is the opposite of inversion , movement of the sole of the foot outward , away from the midline of the body .
__label__1 5605 . Globalization refers to the process of integrating governments , cultures , and financial markets through international trade into a single world market .
__label__0 Often , the process begins with a single motive , such as market expansion ( on the part of a corporation ) or increased access to healthcare ( on the part of a nonprofit organization ) .
__label__0 5629 . Though family and other societal models help guide a person toward a career , personal choice plays a role .
__label__1 In class systems , people have the option to form exogamous marriages , unions of spouses from different social categories .
__label__0 Marriage in these circumstances is based on values such as love and compatibility rather than on social standing or economics .
__label__0 5716 . These differences are based on cultural attitudes toward aging .
__label__0 In China , several studies have noted the attitude of filial piety ( deference and respect to one ’s parents and ancestors in all things ) as defining all other virtues ( Hsu 1971 ; Hamilton 1990 ) .
__label__0 Cultural attitudes in Japan prior to approximately 1986 supported the idea that the elderly deserve assistance ( Ogawa and Retherford 1993 ) .
__label__1 5728 . The earliest gerontological theory in the functionalist perspective is disengagement theory , which suggests that withdrawing from society and social relationships is a natural part of growing old .
__label__0 There are several main points to the theory .
__label__0 5737 . Not even sociologists are able to agree on a single meaning .
__label__1 For our purposes , we ’ll define marriage as a legally recognized social contract between two people , traditionally based on a sexual relationship and implying a permanence of the union .
__label__0 In practicing cultural relativism , we should also consider variations , such as whether a legal union is required ( think of “ common law ” marriage and its equivalents ) , or whether more than two people can be involved ( consider polygamy ) .
__label__0 5758 . Infants are also often victims of physical abuse , particularly in the form of violent shaking .
__label__1 This type of physical abuse is referred to as shaken - baby syndrome , which describes a group of medical symptoms such as brain swelling and retinal hemorrhage resulting from forcefully shaking or causing impact to an infant ’s head .
__label__0 A baby ’s cry is the number one trigger for shaking .
__label__0 6166 . Ultimately , of course , the issue was decided by the Civil War ( 1861 – 1865 ) , with the southern states seceding to defend their “ states ’ rights ” to determine their own destinies without interference by the federal government .
__label__0 Foremost among the rights claimed by the southern states was the right to decide whether their residents would be allowed to own slaves .
__label__0 David M. Potter .
__label__0 6175 . In some states , poorer , less literate white voters feared being disenfranchised by the literacy and understanding tests .
__label__0 Some states introduced a loophole , known as the grandfather clause , to allow less literate whites to vote .
__label__1 The grandfather clause exempted those who had been allowed to vote in that state prior to the Civil War and their descendants from literacy and understanding tests . Keyssar , 112 .
__label__0 Because blacks were not allowed to vote prior to the Civil War , but most white men had been voting at a time when there were no literacy tests , this loophole allowed most illiterate whites to vote ( [ link ] ) while leaving obstacles in place for blacks who wanted to vote as well .
__label__0 6187 . Thus , if a white family chose to sell its house to a black family and the other homeowners in the neighborhood tried to sue the seller , the court would not hear the case .
__label__0 In 1967 , the Supreme Court struck down a Virginia law that prohibited interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia . Loving v. Virginia , 388 U.S. 1 ( 1967 ) .
__label__1 6223 . NOW also declared its support for the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) , which mandated equal treatment for all regardless of sex .
__label__0 The ERA , written by Alice Paul and Crystal Eastman , was first proposed to Congress , unsuccessfully , in 1923 .
__label__0 6235 . The next year , in Worcester v. Georgia , the Court ruled that whites could not enter tribal lands without the tribe ’s permission .
__label__0 White Georgians , however , refused to abide by the Court ’s decision , and President Andrew Jackson , a former Indian fighter , refused to enforce it .
__label__0 Francis Paul Prucha .
__label__0 1984 .
__label__0 6250 . On November 7 , 2012 , the day after the presidential election , journalists found Mitt Romney ’s transition website , detailing the Republican candidate ’s plans for the upcoming inauguration celebration and criteria for Cabinet and White House appointees and leaving space for video of his acceptance speech .
__label__0 Erik Hayden , “ Mitt Romney ’s Transition Website : Where ‘ President - Elect ’ Romney Lives On , ” Time , 8 November 2012 .
__label__0 http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/08/mitt-romneys-transition-website-where-president-elect-romney ( February 17 , 2016 ) .
__label__0 Yet , Romney had lost his bid for the White House .
__label__0 6262 . A magazine might run a story on climate change by interviewing representatives of only one side of the policy debate and downplaying the opposing view , all without acknowledging the one - sided nature of its coverage .
__label__0 In contrast , when the writer or publication makes clear to the reader or viewer that the information offers only one side of the political debate , the political message is overt content .
__label__0 Political commentators like Rush Limbaugh and publications like Mother Jones openly state their ideological viewpoints .
__label__0 6271 . The first opinion poll was taken in 1824 ; it asked voters how they voted as they left their polling places .
__label__1 Informal polls are called straw polls , and they informally collect opinions of a non - random population or group .
__label__0 Newspapers and social media continue the tradition of unofficial polls , mainly because interested readers want to know how elections will end .
__label__0 2014 .
__label__0 4966 . However , if you wanted to understand the typical weather pattern in Chicago , instead of focusing on one - time extremes , you would need to look at the entire pattern of data over time .
__label__0 A similar lesson applies to the study of macroeconomics .
__label__0 It is interesting to study extreme situations , like the Great Depression of the 1930s or what many have called the Great Recession of 2008 – 2009 .
__label__0 If you want to understand the whole picture , however , you need to look at the long term .
__label__0 4972 . The population more than tripled in the twentieth century , from 76 million in 1900 to over 300 million in 2012 .
__label__0 The human capital of modern workers is far higher today because the education and skills of workers have risen dramatically .
__label__0 In 1900 , only about one - eighth of the U.S. population had completed high school and just one person in 40 had completed a four - year college degree .
__label__0 5062 . Monetary policy affects the economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length .
__label__0 Remember , monetary policy involves a chain of events : the central bank must perceive a situation in the economy , hold a meeting , and make a decision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy .
__label__0 The change in monetary policy must percolate through the banking system , changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates .
__label__0 5074 . Most central bankers believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long term .
__label__0 Remember that in the neoclassical model of the economy , the aggregate supply curve is drawn as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] .
__label__0 In the neoclassical model , the level of potential GDP ( and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP ) is determined by real economic factors .
__label__0 5098 . [ link ] also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and demand diagrams in the foreign exchange market .
__label__0 In contrast to all the other cases of supply and demand you have considered , in the foreign exchange market , supply and demand typically both move at the same time .
__label__0 Groups of participants in the foreign exchange market like firms and investors include some who are buyers and some who are sellers .
__label__0 5107 . Every nation would prefer a stable exchange rate to facilitate international trade and reduce the degree of risk and uncertainty in the economy .
__label__0 However , a nation may sometimes want a weaker exchange rate to stimulate aggregate demand and reduce a recession , or a stronger exchange rate to fight inflation .
__label__0 5155 . There is also no particular reason to expect a government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few years .
__label__0 For example , a government may decide that by running large budget deficits , it can make crucial long - term investments in human capital and physical infrastructure that will build the long - term productivity of a country .
__label__0 These decisions may work out well or poorly , but they are not always irrational .
__label__0 5158 . A larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital .
__label__0 If private saving and the trade balance remain the same , then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital .
__label__1 When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital , the result is known as crowding out .
__label__0 To understand the potential impact of crowding out , consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007 .
__label__0 5170 . The national economies that make up the global economy are remarkably diverse .
__label__0 Let us use one key indicator of the standard of living , GDP per capita , to quantify this diversity .
__label__0 You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations .
__label__0 5179 . For unemployment caused by a recession , the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available .
__label__0 The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand .
__label__0 In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates .
__label__0 With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession .
__label__0 5191 . However , any nation that is experiencing a substantial and sustained pattern of trade deficits , along with the corresponding net inflow of international financial capital , has some reason for concern .
__label__0 During the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s , countries that grew dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis as international capital flowed in , saw their economies collapse when the capital very quickly flowed out .
__label__0 5194 . In 1817 , David Ricardo , a businessman , economist , and member of the British Parliament , wrote a treatise called On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation .
__label__1 In this treatise , Ricardo argued that specialization and free trade benefit all trading partners , even those that may be relatively inefficient .
__label__1 4646 . A labor union is an organization of workers that negotiates with employers over wages and working conditions .
__label__0 A labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to deal with workers collectively , rather than as individuals .
__label__1 4661 . Affirmative action is the name given to active efforts by government or businesses that give special rights to minorities in hiring and promotion to make up for past discrimination .
__label__0 Affirmative action , in its limited and not especially controversial form , means making an effort to reach out to a broader range of minority candidates for jobs .
__label__0 4679 . Driving a certain car , drinking a particular soda , or wearing a certain shoe are all unlikely to bring fashionable friends and fun automatically , if at all .
__label__0 The government rules on advertising , enforced by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , allow advertising to contain a certain amount of exaggeration about the general delight of using a product .
__label__0 They , however , also demand that if a claim is presented as a fact , it must be true .
__label__1 4727 . An intermediary is one who stands between two other parties ; for example , a person who arranges a blind date between two other people is one kind of intermediary .
__label__1 In financial capital markets , banks are an example of a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits funds in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank .
__label__0 When a bank serves as a financial intermediary , unlike the situation with a couple on a blind date , the saver and the borrower never meet .
__label__0 1822 . Malpighian Tubules of Insects
__label__0 Malpighian tubules are found lining the gut of some species of arthropods , such as the bee illustrated in [ link ] .
__label__0 They are usually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect .
__label__1 1837 . PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment .
__label__1 A monocyte is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected tissue .
__label__0 Dendritic cells bind molecular signatures of pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction .
__label__0 1921 . A negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH , FSH , and LH .
__label__1 The Sertoli cells produce the hormone inhibin , which is released into the blood when the sperm count is too high .
__label__0 This inhibits the release of GnRH and FSH , which will cause spermatogenesis to slow down .
__label__1 1933 . The cells in the blastula rearrange themselves spatially to form three layers of cells .
__label__0 This process is called gastrulation .
__label__0 During gastrulation , the blastula folds upon itself to form the three layers of cells .
__label__0 1948 . No species exists everywhere ; for example , the Venus flytrap is endemic to a small area in North and South Carolina .
__label__1 An endemic species is one which is naturally found only in a specific geographic area that is usually restricted in size .
__label__1 Other species are generalists : species which live in a wide variety of geographic areas ; the raccoon , for example , is native to most of North and Central America .
__label__0 1981 . The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere , the more thermal energy is reflected back to the Earth ’s surface .
__label__1 Greenhouse gases absorb and emit radiation and are an important factor in the greenhouse effect : the warming of Earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . Evidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and temperature : as carbon dioxide rises , global temperature rises .
__label__1 Greenhouse gases absorb and emit radiation and are an important factor in the greenhouse effect : the warming of Earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . Evidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and temperature : as carbon dioxide rises , global temperature rises .
__label__0 Since 1950 , the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from about 280 ppm to 382 ppm in 2006 .
__label__0 1984 . Many of these tools were originally designed to study human populations .
__label__1 For example , life tables , which detail the life expectancy of individuals within a population , were initially developed by life insurance companies to set insurance rates .
__label__0 In fact , while the term “ demographics ” is commonly used when discussing humans , all living populations can be studied using this approach .
__label__0 2002 . Efforts to control population growth led to the one - child policy in China , which used to include more severe consequences , but now imposes fines on urban couples who have more than one child .
__label__0 Due to the fact that some couples wish to have a male heir , many Chinese couples continue to have more than one child .
__label__1 2014 . Foundation species are considered the “ base ” or “ bedrock ” of a community , having the greatest influence on its overall structure .
__label__1 They are usually the primary producers : organisms that bring most of the energy into the community .
__label__0 2017 . For example , the study of island biogeography attempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains , including the Galápagos Islands that inspired the young Darwin .
__label__1 Relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a habitat , ecosystem , or biome .
__label__0 Foundation species often have the highest relative abundance of species .
__label__0 2074 . For these reasons , scientists study ecosystems under more controlled conditions .
__label__1 Experimental systems usually involve either partitioning a part of a natural ecosystem that can be used for experiments , termed a mesocosm , or by re - creating an ecosystem entirely in an indoor or outdoor laboratory environment , which is referred to as a microcosm .
__label__0 A major limitation to these approaches is that removing individual organisms from their natural ecosystem or altering a natural ecosystem through partitioning may change the dynamics of the ecosystem .
__label__1 2083 . Net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level .
__label__1 Assimilation is the biomass ( energy content generated per unit area ) of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food , energy used for respiration , and energy lost as waste .
__label__1 Assimilation is the biomass ( energy content generated per unit area ) of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food , energy used for respiration , and energy lost as waste .
__label__0 2089 . [ link ] illustrates the average time that an individual water molecule may spend in the Earth ’s major water reservoirs .
__label__1 Residence time is a measure of the average time an individual water molecule stays in a particular reservoir .
__label__0 A large amount of the Earth ’s water is locked in place in these reservoirs as ice , beneath the ground , and in the ocean , and , thus , is unavailable for short - term cycling ( only surface water can evaporate ) .
__label__0 2092 . Atmospheric nitrogen is associated with several effects on Earth ’s ecosystems including the production of acid rain ( as nitric acid , HNO3 ) and greenhouse gas ( as nitrous oxide , N2O ) potentially causing climate change .
__label__1 A major effect from fertilizer runoff is saltwater and freshwater eutrophication , a process whereby nutrient runoff causes the excess growth of microorganisms , depleting dissolved oxygen levels and killing ecosystem fauna .
__label__0 3321 . A characteristic like cleft chin , for example , is influenced by a single gene from each parent .
__label__1 In this example , we will call the gene for cleft chin “ B , ” and the gene for smooth chin “ b. ” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent ( Bb ) or both parents ( BB ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele .
__label__1 When someone has two copies of the same allele , they are said to be homozygous for that allele .
__label__1 3324 . When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene , they are said to be heterozygous .
__label__0 For example , smooth chin is a recessive trait , which means that an individual will only display the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele ( bb).Imagine that a woman with a cleft chin mates with a man with a smooth chin .
__label__0 What type of chin will their child have ?
__label__0 619 . Computer software is used to analyze the vast amount of data generated for proteomic analysis .
__label__0 Genomic - and proteomic - scale analyses are part of systems biology .
__label__1 Systems biology is the study of whole biological systems ( genomes and proteomes ) based on interactions within the system .
__label__0 The European Bioinformatics Institute and the Human Proteome Organization ( HUPO ) are developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous pile of systems biology data .
__label__0 796 . This definition also includes re - emerging diseases that were previously under control .
__label__1 Approximately 75 percent of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are zoonotic diseases , zoonoses , diseases that primarily infect animals and are transmitted to humans ; some are of viral origin and some are of bacterial origin .
__label__1 Brucellosis is an example of a prokaryotic zoonosis that is re - emerging in some regions , and necrotizing fasciitis ( commonly known as flesh - eating bacteria ) has been increasing in virulence for the last 80 years for unknown reasons .
__label__0 The map shows regions where bacterial diseases are emerging or reemerging .
__label__0 808 . As cell biology developed in the twentieth century , it became clear that mitochondria were the organelles responsible for producing ATP using aerobic respiration .
__label__1 In the 1960s , American biologist Lynn Margulis developed endosymbiotic theory , which states that eukaryotes may have been a product of one cell engulfing another , one living within another , and evolving over time until the separate cells were no longer recognizable as such .
__label__0 In 1967 , Margulis introduced new work on the theory and substantiated her findings through microbiological evidence .
__label__0 832 . They vary in their oxygen requirement .
__label__1 Most fungi are obligate aerobes , requiring oxygen to survive .
__label__1 Other species , such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle , are are obligate anaerobes , in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them .
__label__0 3254 . But baryons have B = +1 B = +1 size 12 { B
__label__0 The conservation of total baryon number is a more general rule than first noted in nuclear physics , where it was observed that the total number of nucleons was always conserved in nuclear reactions and decays .
__label__0 That rule in nuclear physics is just one consequence of the conservation of the total baryon number .
__label__0 3257 . ( Whimsical names are common in particle physics , reflecting the personalities of modern physicists . )
__label__0 Originally , three quark types — or flavors — were proposed to account for the then - known mesons and baryons .
__label__0 These quark flavors are named up ( u ) , down ( d ) , and strange ( s ) .
__label__0 3263 . Color is consistent with all observations and is now widely accepted .
__label__1 Quark theory including color is called quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ) , also named by Gell - Mann .
__label__1 1525 . Adipose tissue is a connective tissue found throughout the body .
__label__0 It produces the hormone leptin in response to food intake .
__label__0 Leptin increases the activity of anorexigenic neurons and decreases that of orexigenic neurons , producing a feeling of satiety after eating , thus affecting appetite and reducing the urge for further eating .
__label__0 1564 . The fatty acids are released into the bloodstream for other tissues to use for ATP production .
__label__0 The glucocorticoids primarily affect glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose synthesis .
__label__0 Glucocorticoids also have anti - inflammatory properties through inhibition of the immune system .
__label__1 3614 . Our ability to perceive spatial relationships in three - dimensional ( 3-D ) space is known as depth perception .
__label__0 With depth perception , we can describe things as being in front , behind , above , below , or to the side of other things .
__label__1 3632 . Some people are born deaf , which is known as congenital deafness .
__label__0 Many others begin to suffer from conductive hearing loss because of age , genetic predisposition , or environmental effects , including exposure to extreme noise ( noise - induced hearing loss , as shown in [ link ] ) , certain illnesses ( such as measles or mumps ) , or damage due to toxins ( such as those found in certain solvents and metals ) .
__label__0 3641 . Molecules from the food and beverages we consume dissolve in our saliva and interact with taste receptors on our tongue and in our mouth and throat .
__label__1 Taste buds are formed by groupings of taste receptor cells with hair - like extensions that protrude into the central pore of the taste bud ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 Taste buds have a life cycle of ten days to two weeks , so even destroying some by burning your tongue wo n’t have any long - term effect ; they just grow right back .
__label__1 3755 . Robert Sternberg developed another theory of intelligence , which he titled the triarchic theory of intelligence because it sees intelligence as comprised of three parts ( Sternberg , 1988 ) : practical , creative , and analytical intelligence ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 3761 . In these cultures , the importance of the group supersedes the importance of individual achievement .
__label__1 When you visit such a culture , how well you relate to the values of that culture exemplifies your cultural intelligence , sometimes referred to as cultural competence .
__label__1 2755 . Conservation of energy ( as physicists like to call the principle that energy can neither be created nor destroyed ) is based on experiment .
__label__0 Even as scientists discovered new forms of energy , conservation of energy has always been found to apply .
__label__1 2764 . An important characteristic is that the work done by a nonconservative force adds or removes mechanical energy from a system .
__label__0 Friction , for example , creates thermal energy that dissipates , removing energy from the system .
__label__0 Furthermore , even if the thermal energy is retained or captured , it can not be fully converted back to work , so it is lost or not recoverable in that sense as well . The amount of the happy face erased depends on the path taken by the eraser between points A and B , as does the work done against friction .
__label__0 5814 . If private schools were the only educational institutions , most poor and working - class children and many middle - class children would be uneducated .
__label__0 Private schooling is a type of good called a toll good .
__label__1 Toll goods are available to many people , and many people can make use of them , but only if they can pay the price .
__label__0 5817 . In the United States , for example , Congress passes laws regulating banking , and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories , the purity of food offered for sale , and the safety of toys and automobiles .
__label__0 In this way , government checks the actions of business , something that it would not do if capitalism in the United States functioned strictly in the manner that Adam Smith believed it should … almost entirely unregulated .
__label__0 5871 . Enterprise : The Dynamic Economy of a Free People .
__label__0 Cambridge , MA : Harvard University Press , 223 .
__label__0 A few months later , the British surrendered .
__label__1 Americans wished their new government to be a republic , a regime in which the people , not a monarch , held power and elected representatives to govern according to the rule of law .
__label__0 Many , however , feared that a nation as large as the United States could not be ruled effectively as a republic .
__label__0 5886 . Following the Revolution , some of the northern states had either abolished slavery or instituted plans by which slaves would gradually be emancipated .
__label__0 Pennsylvania , for example , had passed the Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery in 1780 .
__label__1 All people born in the state to enslaved mothers after the law ’s passage would become indentured servants to be set free at age twenty - eight .
__label__0 5916 . A major problem with the Articles of Confederation had been the nation ’s inability to change them without the unanimous consent of all the states .
__label__0 The framers learned this lesson well .
__label__0 5949 . Shared and overlapping powers have become an integral part of contemporary U.S. federalism .
__label__0 These concurrent powers range from taxing , borrowing , and making and enforcing laws to establishing court systems ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 Elton E. Richter . 1929 .
__label__0 5952 . Lastly , three civil rights amendments — the Fifteenth , Nineteenth , and Twenty - Sixth — prevent both the states and the federal government from abridging citizens ’ right to vote based on race , sex , and age .
__label__1 This topic remains controversial because states have not always ensured equal protection . The supremacy clause in Article VI of the Constitution regulates relationships between the federal and state governments by declaring that the Constitution and federal law are the supreme law of the land .
__label__0 This means that if a state law clashes with a federal law found to be within the national government ’s constitutional authority , the federal law prevails .
__label__0 6003 . During the administrations of Presidents Richard Nixon ( 1969–1974 ) and Ronald Reagan ( 1981–1989 ) , attempts were made to reverse the process of nationalization — that is , to restore states ’ prominence in policy areas into which the federal government had moved in the past .
__label__0 New federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency , reduces overall public spending , and improves policy outcomes .
__label__0 2014 .
__label__1 6021 . Finally , some mandates come in the form of partial preemption regulations , whereby the federal government sets national regulatory standards but delegates the enforcement to state and local governments .
__label__1 For example , the Clean Air Act sets air quality regulations but instructs states to design implementation plans to achieve such standards ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 Martha Derthick .
__label__0 6024 . The number of mandates has continued to rise , and some have been especially costly to states and local authorities .
__label__0 Consider the Real ID Act of 2005 , a federal law designed to beef up homeland security .
__label__1 The law requires driver ’s licenses and state - issued identification cards ( DL / IDs ) to contain standardized anti - fraud security features , specific data , and machine - readable technology .
__label__0 3252 . The division between mesons and baryons is actually based on their observed decay modes and is not strictly associated with their masses .
__label__1 Mesons are hadrons that can decay to leptons and leave no hadrons , which implies that mesons are not conserved in number .
__label__1 Baryons are hadrons that always decay to another baryon .
__label__0 3261 . What ’s Color got to do with it ?
__label__0 — A Whiter Shade of Pale
__label__0 As mentioned and shown in [ link ] , quarks carry another quantum number , which we call color .
__label__0 Of course , it is not the color we sense with visible light , but its properties are analogous to those of three primary and three secondary colors .
__label__0 3276 . After this time , the forces become distinct in almost all interactions — they are no longer unified or symmetric .
__label__1 This transition from GUT to electroweak is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking , in which conditions spontaneously evolved to a point where the forces were no longer unified , breaking that symmetry .
__label__0 This is analogous to a phase transition in the universe , and a clever proposal by American physicist Alan Guth in the early 1980s ties it to the smoothness of the CMBR .
__label__0 3282 . It is interesting that several prominent physicists who worked on the concept , including Einstein , firmly believed that nature would find a way to prohibit such objects .
__label__0 Black holes are difficult to observe directly , because they are small and no light comes directly from them .
__label__1 In fact , no light comes from inside the event horizon , which is defined to be at a distance from the object at which the escape velocity is exactly the speed of light .
__label__0 The radius of the event horizon is known as the Schwarzschild radius RS RS size 12 { R rSub { size 8 { S } } } { } and is given by

__label__0 The majority of the men and women in Congress also engaged in either state or local politics , were business people , or practiced law before being elected to Congress . Manning , p. 3 ( Table 2 ) .
__label__0 Approximately 80 percent of both the Senate and the House of Representatives are male , and about 21 percent of members of Congress are people of color ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 The nation ’s laws are made primarily by well - educated white male professionals and businessmen .
__label__0 This official photograph of the the 114th Congress depicts the fairly uniform nature of congressional representation .
__label__0 5855 . Laws were made by Parliament , and property - owning males were allowed to vote for representatives to Parliament .
__label__0 Thus , Americans were accustomed to the idea of representative government from the beginning .
__label__0 For instance , Virginia established its House of Burgesses in 1619 .
__label__0 5912 . Objections that an elite group of wealthy and educated bankers , businessmen , and large landowners would come to dominate the nation ’s politics were also addressed by Madison in Federalist No .
__label__0 5921 . Many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the English Bill of Rights and the Virginia Declaration of Rights .
__label__1 For example , the right to bear arms for protection ( Second Amendment ) , the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime ( Third Amendment ) , the right to a trial by jury ( Sixth and Seventh Amendments ) , and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment ( Eighth Amendment ) are taken from the English Bill of Rights .
__label__1 The Fifth Amendment , which requires among other things that people can not be deprived of their life , liberty , or property except by a legal proceeding , was also greatly influenced by English law as well as the protections granted to Virginians in the Virginia Declaration of Rights .
__label__0 5957 . In 2014 , the Supreme Court decided not to hear several key case appeals from a variety of states , all of which were brought by opponents of marriage equality who had lost in the federal courts .
__label__0 The outcome of not hearing these cases was that federal court decisions in four states were affirmed , which , when added to other states in the same federal circuit districts , brought the total number of states permitting same - sex marriage to thirty .
__label__0 Adam Liptak , “ Supreme Court Delivers Tacit Win to Gay Marriage , ” New York Times , 6 October , 2014 .
__label__1 Then , in 2015 , the Obergefell v. Hodges case had a sweeping effect when the Supreme Court clearly identified a constitutional right to marriage based on the Fourteenth Amendment . Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2015 ) .
__label__0 5963 . As George Washington ’s secretary of the treasury from 1789 to 1795 , Alexander Hamilton championed legislative efforts to create a publicly chartered bank .
__label__0 For Hamilton , the establishment of the Bank of the United States was fully within Congress ’s authority , and he hoped the bank would foster economic development , print and circulate paper money , and provide loans to the government .
__label__1 5999 . Medicaid ( which provides medical assistance to the indigent ) , Medicare ( which provides health insurance to the elderly and disabled ) , and school nutrition programs were created .
__label__0 The Elementary and Secondary Education Act ( 1965 ) , the Higher Education Act ( 1965 ) , and the Head Start preschool program ( 1965 ) were established to expand educational opportunities and equality ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 The Clean Air Act ( 1965 ) , the Highway Safety Act ( 1966 ) , and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act ( 1966 ) promoted environmental and consumer protection .
__label__0 2014 . “ Op - ed : In the Wake of Windsor , ” June 26 . http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2014/06/26/op-ed-wake-windsor ( June 24 , 2015 ) .
__label__1 In the final analysis , same - sex marriage is a protected constitutional right as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court , which took up the issue again when it heard Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015 .
__label__0 4318 . A similar pattern often operates within businesses .
__label__1 In many cases , a business that focuses on one or a few products ( sometimes called its “ core competency ” ) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products .
__label__1 Third , specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale , which means that for many goods , as the level of production increases , the average cost of producing each individual unit declines .
__label__0 4333 . But the decisions of what will be produced and what prices will be charged are heavily regulated .
__label__1 Heavily regulated economies often have underground economies , which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government ’s approval .
__label__0 4396 . Whatever the firm ’s quantity of production , total revenue must exceed total costs if it is to earn a profit .
__label__0 As explored in the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity , fixed costs are often sunk costs that can not be recouped .
__label__0 In thinking about what to do next , sunk costs should typically be ignored , since this spending has already been made and can not be changed .
__label__0 4399 . Many industries experience economies of scale .
__label__1 Economies of scale refers to the situation where , as the quantity of output goes up , the cost per unit goes down .
__label__0 This is the idea behind “ warehouse stores ” like Costco or Walmart .
__label__0 6432 . But even stretching the truth can be costly for a publisher .
__label__0 In 2010 , Star magazine published a headline , “ Addiction Nightmare : Katie Drug Shocker , ” leading readers to believe actress Katie Holmes was taking drugs .
__label__0 While the article in the magazine focuses on the addictive quality of Scientology sessions rather than drugs , the implication and the headline were different .
__label__0 6447 . In his 2008 presidential run , Barack Obama promised to run a transparent White House .
__label__0 Christopher Beam , “ The TMI President , ” Slate , 12 November 2008 .
__label__0 Yet once in office , he found that transparency makes it difficult to get work done , and so he limited access and questions .
__label__0 In his first year in office , George W. Bush , who was criticized by Obama as having a closed government , gave 147 question - and - answer sessions with journalists , while Obama gave only 46 .
__label__0 6471 . Then , legislative seats are doled out to the parties based on the proportion of support each party receives .
__label__0 While the Green Party in the United States might not win a single congressional seat in some years thanks to plurality voting , in a proportional system , it stands a chance to get a few seats in the legislature regardless .
__label__0 For example , assume the Green Party gets 7 percent of the vote .
__label__0 6483 . By fostering a sense of loyalty , a party can insulate itself from changes in the system and improve its odds of winning elections .
__label__1 The party - in - the - electorate are those members of the voting public who consider themselves to be part of a political party and/or who consistently prefer the candidates of one party over the other .
__label__0 6507 . However , in its one - person - one - vote decision in Reynolds v. Simms ( 1964 ) , the Supreme Court argued that everyone ’s vote should count roughly the same regardless of where they lived . Reynolds v. Simms , 379 U.S. 870 ( 1964 ) .
__label__0 Districts had to be adjusted so they would have roughly equal populations .
__label__0 Several states therefore had to make dramatic changes to their electoral maps during the next two redistricting cycles ( 1970 – 1972 and 1980 – 1982 ) .
__label__0 6540 . Lobbyists representing a variety of organizations employ different techniques to achieve their objectives .
__label__1 One method is inside lobbying or direct lobbying , which takes the interest group ’s message directly to a government official such as a lawmaker .
__label__0 Nownes and Newmark , “ Interest Groups in the States . ”
__label__0 Inside lobbying tactics include testifying in legislative hearings and helping to draft legislation .
__label__0 Numerous surveys of lobbyists have confirmed that the vast majority rely on these inside strategies .
__label__0 6549 . AARP , for example , offers discounts on hotel accommodations and insurance rates for its members , while dues are very low , so they can actually save money by joining .
__label__1 Group leaders may also offer solidary incentives , which provide the benefit of joining with others who have the same concerns or are similar in other ways .
__label__0 Some scholars suggest that people are naturally drawn to others with similar concerns .
__label__1 2998 . These rules are special cases of the laws of conservation of charge and conservation of energy .
__label__0 The rules are known as Kirchhoff ’s rules , after their inventor Gustav Kirchhoff ( 1824 – 1887 ) .
__label__0 This circuit can not be reduced to a combination of series and parallel connections .
__label__0 Kirchhoff ’s rules , special applications of the laws of conservation of charge and energy , can be used to analyze it .
__label__1 3004 . Analog meters have a needle that swivels to point at numbers on a scale , as opposed to digital meters , which have numerical readouts similar to a hand - held calculator .
__label__1 The heart of most analog meters is a device called a galvanometer , denoted by G. Current flow through a galvanometer , IG IG size 12 { I rSub { size 8 { G } } } { } , produces a proportional needle deflection .
__label__0 3019 . Since magnetic forces act at a distance , we define a magnetic field to represent magnetic forces .
__label__0 The pictorial representation of magnetic field lines is very useful in visualizing the strength and direction of the magnetic field .
__label__1 As shown in [ link ] , the direction of magnetic field lines is defined to be the direction in which the north end of a compass needle points .
__label__0 3112 . Objectives arranged in this way are described as parfocal .
__label__1 The second , the eyepiece , also referred to as the ocular , has several lenses which slide inside a cylindrical barrel .
__label__0 The focusing ability is provided by the movement of both the objective lens and the eyepiece .
__label__1 947 . Bilateral symmetry involves the division of the animal through a sagittal plane , resulting in two mirror image , right and left halves , such as those of a butterfly ( [ link]d ) , crab , or human body .
__label__1 Animals with bilateral symmetry have a “ head ” and “ tail ” ( anterior vs. posterior ) , front and back ( dorsal vs. ventral ) , and right and left sides ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 6720 . Her immediate successors returned to the less visible role held by her predecessors , although in the early 1960s , Jacqueline Kennedy gained attention for her efforts to refurbish the White House along historical lines , and Lady Bird Johnson in the mid- and late 1960s endorsed an effort to beautify public spaces and highways in the United States .
__label__0 She also established the foundations of what came to be known as the Office of the First Lady , complete with a news reporter , Liz Carpenter , as her press secretary .
__label__1 6747 . Starting in New York in 1790 , the early Supreme Court focused on establishing its rules and procedures and perhaps trying to carve its place as the new government ’s third branch .
__label__0 However , given the difficulty of getting all the justices even to show up , and with no permanent home or building of its own for decades , finding its footing in the early days proved to be a monumental task .
__label__0 6759 . People who opposed the law and understood that a congressional repeal would not happen any time soon looked to the courts for help .
__label__0 They challenged the constitutionality of the law in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius , hoping the Supreme Court would overturn it . National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .
__label__1 The practice of judicial review enabled the law ’s critics to exercise this opportunity , even though their hopes were ultimately dashed when , by a narrow 5 – 4 margin , the Supreme Court upheld the health care law as a constitutional extension of Congress ’s power to tax .
__label__0 6873 . South Carolina governor Nikki Haley delivers her 2015 State of the State address from the State House in Columbia , South Carolina , on January 21 , 2015 .
__label__0 6876 . For instance , most states provide governors the power of the line - item veto .
__label__0 The line - item veto gives governors the ability to strike out a line or individual portions of a bill while letting the remainder pass into law .
__label__0 In addition , approximately 30 percent of governors have the power of an amendatory veto , which allows them to send a bill back to the legislature and request a specific amendment to it .
__label__1 6903 . Under a council - elected executive system , the voters elect both the members of the council and the executive .
__label__0 The executive performs functions similar to those of the state governor .
__label__0 6942 . A number of laws passed in the decades between the end of the Second World War and the late 1970s have created a framework through which citizens can exercise their own bureaucratic oversight .
__label__0 The two most important laws are the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 and the Government in Sunshine Act of 1976 . https://www.law.cornell.edu / uscode / text/5/552 ; https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg1241.pdf ( June 6 , 2016 ) .
__label__0 Like many of the modern bureaucratic reforms in the United States , both emerged during a period of heightened skepticism about government activities .
__label__0 6951 . They turn instead to the vast government bureaucracy to provide policy guidance .
__label__1 For example , when Congress passed the Clean Water Act ( 1972 ) , it dictated that steps should be taken to improve water quality throughout the country .
__label__0 But it ultimately left it to the bureaucracy to figure out exactly how ‘ clean ’ water needed to be .
__label__0 6954 . For example , your home or apartment is a private good reserved for your own use because you pay rent or make mortgage payments for the privilege of living there .
__label__0 Further , private goods are finite and can run out if overused , even if only in the short term .
__label__0 The fact that private goods are excludable and finite makes them tradable .
__label__0 6969 . In societies operating in survival mode , in contrast , people tend to focus more on short - term problem - solving than on long - term planning .
__label__0 Second , social welfare policy creates an automatic stimulus for a society by building a safety net that can catch members of society who are suffering economic hardship through no fault of their own .
__label__0 For an individual family , this safety net makes the difference between eating and starving ; for an entire economy , it could prevent an economic recession from sliding into a broader and more damaging depression .
__label__0 6999 . What is foreign policy ?
__label__1 We can think of it on several levels , as “ the goals that a state ’s officials seek to attain abroad , the values that give rise to those objectives , and the means or instruments used to pursue them . ”
__label__0 Eugene R. Wittkopf , Christopher M. Jones , and Charles W. Kegley , Jr. 2007 .
__label__0 5333 . It includes everything produced by a society , including all of the social rules .
__label__1 Sociologists often study culture using the sociological imagination , which pioneer sociologist C. Wright Mills described as an awareness of the relationship between a person ’s behavior and experience and the wider culture that shaped the person ’s choices and perceptions .
__label__0 It ’s a way of seeing our own and other people ’s behavior in relationship to history and social structure ( 1959 ) .
__label__1 5423 . While pastoral and horticultural societies used small , temporary tools such as digging sticks or hoes , agricultural societies relied on permanent tools for survival .
__label__1 Around 3000 B.C.E. , an explosion of new technology known as the Agricultural Revolution made farming possible — and profitable .
__label__0 5447 . One person can be associated with a multitude of roles and statuses .
__label__0 Even a single status such as “ student ” has a complex role - set , or array of roles , attached to it ( Merton 1957 ) .
__label__0 If too much is required of a single role , individuals can experience role strain .
__label__0 5453 . Half these people were children .
__label__1 A refugee is defined as an individual who has been forced to leave his or her country in order to escape war , persecution , or natural disaster , while asylum - seekers are those whose claim to refugee status has not been validated .
__label__0 An internally displaced person , on the other hand , is neither a refugee nor an asylum - seeker .
__label__0 5462 . Functional perspectives on urbanization generally focus on the ecology of the city , while conflict perspective tends to focus on political economy .
__label__1 Human ecology is a functionalist field of study that looks at on the relationship between people and their built and natural physical environments ( Park 1915 ) .
__label__0 Generally speaking , urban land use and urban population distribution occur in a predictable pattern once we understand how people relate to their living environment .
__label__1 5307 . A mass is a relatively large number of people with a common interest , though they may not be in close proximity ( Lofland 1993 ) , such as players of the popular Facebook game Farmville .
__label__1 A public , on the other hand , is an unorganized , relatively diffused group of people who share ideas , such as the Libertarian political party .
__label__0 While these two types of crowds are similar , they are not the same .
__label__0 5337 . He held that once scholars identified the laws that governed society , sociologists could address problems such as poor education and poverty ( Abercrombie et al .
__label__0 2000).Comte named the scientific study of social patterns positivism .
__label__0 He described his philosophy in a series of books called The Course in Positive Philosophy ( 1830–1842 ) and A General View of Positivism ( 1848 ) .
__label__0 2421 . As the Gilded Age unfolded , presidents had very little power , due in large part to highly contested elections in which relative popular majorities were razor - thin .
__label__0 Two presidents won the Electoral College without a popular majority .
__label__0 2463 . The subsequent discovery of gold in California in 1848 further spurred interest in connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , and led to the construction of the Panama Railway , which began operations in 1855 .
__label__0 Several attempts by France to construct a canal between 1881 and 1894 failed due to a combination of financial crises and health hazards , including malaria and yellow fever , which led to the deaths of thousands of French workers .
__label__0 2559 . While these laws touched on important aspects of the Great Society , the centerpiece of Johnson ’s plan was the eradication of poverty in the United States .
__label__0 The war on poverty , as he termed it , was fought on many fronts .
__label__1 The 1965 Housing and Urban Development Act offered grants to improve city housing and subsidized rents for the poor .
__label__1 5305 . Expressive crowds are people who join together to express emotion , often at funerals , weddings , or the like .
__label__1 The final type , acting crowds , focuses on a specific goal or action , such as a protest movement or riot . In addition to the different types of crowds , collective groups can also be identified in two other ways .
__label__1 A mass is a relatively large number of people with a common interest , though they may not be in close proximity ( Lofland 1993 ) , such as players of the popular Facebook game Farmville .
__label__1 5452 . Urbanization is the study of the social , political , and economic relationships in cities , and someone specializing in urban sociology studies those relationships .
__label__0 In some ways , cities can be microcosms of universal human behavior , while in others they provide a unique environment that yields its own brand of human behavior .
__label__0 5476 . Thomas Malthus ( 1766 – 1834 ) was an English clergyman who made dire predictions about earth ’s ability to sustain its growing population .
__label__0 According to Malthusian theory , three factors would control human population that exceeded the earth ’s carrying capacity , or how many people can live in a given area considering the amount of available resources .
__label__0 Malthus identified these factors as war , famine , and disease ( Malthus 1798 ) .
__label__0 5479 . Societies develop along a predictable continuum as they evolve from unindustrialized to postindustrial .
__label__1 Demographic transition theory ( Caldwell and Caldwell 2006 ) suggests that future population growth will develop along a predictable four - stage model .
__label__0 In Stage 1 , birth , death , and infant mortality rates are all high , while life expectancy is short .
__label__0 An example of this stage is the 1800s in the United States .
__label__0 5503 . We can imagine that an army general or a Fortune 500 CEO would be an instrumental leader .
__label__1 In contrast , expressive leaders are more concerned with promoting emotional strength and health , and ensuring that people feel supported .
__label__0 Social and religious leaders — rabbis , priests , imams , directors of youth homes and social service programs — are often perceived as expressive leaders .
__label__0 5509 . A complaint of modern life is that society is dominated by large and impersonal secondary organizations .
__label__0 From schools to businesses to healthcare to government , these organizations , referred to as formal organizations , are highly bureaucratized .
__label__0 Indeed , all formal organizations are , or likely will become , bureaucracies .
__label__0 4242 . People with these disorders display a personality style that is odd or eccentric .
__label__1 Cluster B disorders include antisocial personality disorder , histrionic personality disorder , narcissistic personality disorder , and borderline personality disorder .
__label__0 People with these disorders usually are impulsive , overly dramatic , highly emotional , and erratic .
__label__1 4245 . According to the DSM-5 , the individual with antisocial personality disorder ( sometimes referred to as psychopathy ) shows no regard at all for other people ’s rights or feelings .
__label__0 This lack of regard is exhibited a number of ways and can include repeatedly performing illegal acts , lying to or conning others , impulsivity and recklessness , irritability and aggressiveness toward others , and failure to act in a responsible way ( e.g. , leaving debts unpaid ) ( APA , 2013 ) .
__label__1 12 . A variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment .
__label__1 The control group contains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that is hypothesized about .
__label__0 Therefore , if the results of the experimental group differ from the control group , the difference must be due to the hypothesized manipulation , rather than some outside factor .
__label__0 75 . To return to the example of excess hydrogen ions in the blood , the formation of carbonic acid will be the major direction of the reaction .
__label__0 However , the carbonic acid can also leave the body as carbon dioxide gas ( via exhalation ) instead of being converted back to bicarbonate ion , thus driving the reaction to the right by the chemical law known as law of mass action .
__label__0 These reactions are important for maintaining the homeostasis of our blood .
__label__1 78 . This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as electron transfer .
__label__0 As [ link ] illustrates , sodium ( Na ) only has one electron in its outer electron shell .
__label__1 117 . In doing so , monomers release water molecules as byproducts .
__label__0 This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis , which means “ to put together while losing water . ”
__label__0 1233 . In monocots , petals usually number three or multiples of three ; in dicots , the number of petals is four or five , or multiples of four and five .
__label__1 Together , the calyx and corolla are known as the perianth .
__label__1 The third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium .
__label__0 1263 . In monocot seeds ( [ link ] ) , the testa and tegmen of the seed coat are fused .
__label__1 As the seed germinates , the primary root emerges , protected by the root - tip covering : the coleorhiza .
__label__1 Next , the primary shoot emerges , protected by the coleoptile : the covering of the shoot tip .
__label__1 1290 . Torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions .
__label__0 Torpor can be used by animals for long periods , such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months , in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature .
__label__0 During hibernation , ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) , while a bear ’s internal temperature is maintained higher at about 37 ° C ( 99 ° F ) .
__label__1 If torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water , it is called estivation .
__label__0 4618 . Comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues : economic inequality and poverty .
__label__1 Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living .
__label__1 Income inequality compares the share of the total income ( or wealth ) in society that is received by different groups ; for example , comparing the share of income received by the top 10 % to the share of income received by the bottom 10 % .
__label__1 4630 . The earned income tax credit ( EITC ) , first passed in 1975 , is a method of assisting the working poor through the tax system .
__label__0 The EITC is one of the largest assistance program for low - income groups , and projections for 2013 expected 26 million households to take advantage of it at an estimated cost of $ 50 billion .
__label__1 4684 . Insurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental financial effect .
__label__1 Generally , households or firms with insurance make regular payments , called premiums .
__label__0 The insurance company prices these premiums based on the probability of certain events occurring among a pool of people .
__label__0 4708 . Another source of financial capital is a bond .
__label__1 A bond is a financial contract : a borrower agrees to repay the amount that was borrowed and also a rate of interest over a period of time in the future .
__label__0 A corporate bond is issued by firms , but bonds are also issued by various levels of government .
__label__0 4723 . The mechanisms for saving available to households can be divided into several categories : deposits in bank accounts ; bonds ; stocks ; money market mutual funds ; stock and bond mutual funds ; and housing and other tangible assets like owning gold .
__label__0 Each of these investments needs to be analyzed in terms of three factors : ( 1 ) the expected rate of return it will pay ; ( 2 ) the risk that the return will be much lower or higher than expected ; and ( 3 ) the liquidity of the investment , which refers to how easily money or financial assets can be exchanged for a good or service .
__label__0 We will do this analysis as we discuss each of these investments in the sections below .
__label__1 307 . The actual step that converts light energy into chemical energy takes place in a multiprotein complex called a photosystem , two types of which are found embedded in the thylakoid membrane , photosystem II ( PSII ) and photosystem I ( PSI ) ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 The two complexes differ on the basis of what they oxidize ( that is , the source of the low - energy electron supply ) and what they reduce ( the place to which they deliver their energized electrons ) .
__label__0 3619 . The ear can be separated into multiple sections .
__label__1 The outer ear includes the pinna , which is the visible part of the ear that protrudes from our heads , the auditory canal , and the tympanic membrane , or eardrum .
__label__1 The middle ear contains three tiny bones known as the ossicles , which are named the malleus ( or hammer ) , incus ( or anvil ) , and the stapes ( or stirrup ) .
__label__1 3622 . As the ossicles move , the stapes presses into a thin membrane of the cochlea known as the oval window .
__label__1 As the stapes presses into the oval window , the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move , which in turn stimulates hair cells , which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane .
__label__1 The basilar membrane is a thin strip of tissue within the cochlea .
__label__0 3673 . When Pavlov paired the tone with the meat powder over and over again , the previously neutral stimulus ( the tone ) also began to elicit salivation from the dogs .
__label__1 Thus , the neutral stimulus became the conditioned stimulus ( CS ) , which is a stimulus that elicits a response after repeatedly being paired with an unconditioned stimulus .
__label__0 Eventually , the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone , just as they previously had salivated at the sound of the assistants ’ footsteps .
__label__0 3814 . As mentioned earlier , the hippocampus is also involved in emotional processing .
__label__0 Like the amygdala , research has demonstrated that hippocampal structure and function are linked to a variety of mood and anxiety disorders .
__label__0 3853 . There are three types of encoding .
__label__1 The encoding of words and their meaning is known as semantic encoding .
__label__0 It was first demonstrated by William Bousfield ( 1935 ) in an experiment in which he asked people to memorize words .
__label__1 3859 . In the Atkinson - Shiffrin model , stimuli from the environment are processed first in sensory memory : storage of brief sensory events , such as sights , sounds , and tastes .
__label__1 In the Atkinson - Shiffrin model , stimuli from the environment are processed first in sensory memory : storage of brief sensory events , such as sights , sounds , and acquisition .
__label__0 It is very brief storage — up to a couple of seconds .
__label__1 3862 . Then , information in short - term memory goes to long - term memory ( you save it to your hard drive ) , or it is discarded ( you delete a document or close a web browser ) .
__label__1 This step of rehearsal , the conscious repetition of information to be remembered , to move STM into long - term memory is called memory consolidation .
__label__0 3877 . Lashley did not find evidence of the engram , and the rats were still able to find their way through the maze , regardless of the size or location of the lesion .
__label__1 Based on his creation of lesions and the animals ’ reaction , he formulated the equipotentiality hypothesis : if part of one area of the brain involved in memory is damaged , another part of the same area can take over that memory function ( Lashley , 1950 ) .
__label__0 Although Lashley ’s early work did not confirm the existence of the engram , modern psychologists are making progress locating it .
__label__1 3883 . A flashbulb memory is an exceptionally clear recollection of an important event ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 Where were you when you first heard about the 9/11 terrorist attacks ?
__label__0 3886 . He disagreed , however , with Skinner ’s strict behaviorist approach to personality development , because he felt that thinking and reasoning are important components of learning .
__label__0 He presented a social - cognitive theory of personality that emphasizes both learning and cognition as sources of individual differences in personality .
__label__1 In social - cognitive theory , the concepts of reciprocal determinism , observational learning , and self - efficacy all play a part in personality development .
__label__1 2666 . Weight ( also called force of gravity ) is a pervasive force that acts at all times and must be counteracted to keep an object from falling .
__label__0 You definitely notice that you must support the weight of a heavy object by pushing up on it when you hold it stationary , as illustrated in [ link ] ( a ) .
__label__0 2699 . It may be a number on a digital clock , a heartbeat , or the position of the Sun in the sky .
__label__1 In physics , the definition of time is simple — time is change , or the interval over which change occurs .
__label__0 It is impossible to know that time has passed unless something changes .
__label__1 2735 . The property of a body to remain at rest or to remain in motion with constant velocity is called inertia .
__label__0 Newton ’s first law is often called the law of inertia .
__label__0 As we know from experience , some objects have more inertia than others .
__label__0 2891 . [ link ] shows the displacement of a harmonic oscillator for different amounts of damping .
__label__1 When we want to damp out oscillations , such as in the suspension of a car , we may want the system to return to equilibrium as quickly as possible Critical damping is defined as the condition in which the damping of an oscillator results in it returning as quickly as possible to its equilibrium position The critically damped system may overshoot the equilibrium position , but if it does , it will do so only once .
__label__0 Critical damping is represented by Curve A in [ link ] .
__label__0 934 . Pollen grains can travel far from their original sporophyte , spreading the plant ’s genes .
__label__0 The seed offers the embryo protection , nourishment , and a mechanism to maintain dormancy for tens or even thousands of years , ensuring germination can occur when growth conditions are optimal .
__label__0 Seeds therefore allow plants to disperse the next generation through both space and time .
__label__1 937 . Flowers and Fruits as an Evolutionary AdaptationAngiosperms produce their gametes in separate organs , which are usually housed in a flower .
__label__0 Both fertilization and embryo development take place inside an anatomical structure that provides a stable system of sexual reproduction largely sheltered from environmental fluctuations .
__label__1 943 . This leads to the formation of the next developmental stage , the gastrula , in which the future digestive cavity is formed .
__label__1 Different cell layers ( called germ layers ) are formed during gastrulation .
__label__0 These germ layers are programmed to develop into certain tissue types , organs , and organ systems during a process called organogenesis .
__label__0 946 . Only a few animal groups display radial symmetry .
__label__1 All types of symmetry are well suited to meet the unique demands of a particular animal ’s lifestyle . Radial symmetry is the arrangement of body parts around a central axis , as is seen in a drinking glass or pie .
__label__0 It results in animals having top and bottom surfaces but no left and right sides , or front or back .
__label__0 952 . Examples of acoelomates include animals in the phylum Platyhelminthes , also known as flatworms .
__label__1 Animals with a true coelom are called eucoelomates ( or coelomates ) ( [ link ] ) .
__label__1 A true coelom arises entirely within the mesoderm germ layer and is lined by an epithelial membrane .
__label__1 958 . The coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process called schizocoely , meaning that during development , a solid mass of the mesoderm splits apart and forms the hollow opening of the coelom .
__label__0 Deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process called enterocoely .
__label__1 Here , the mesoderm develops as pouches that are pinched off from the endoderm tissue .
__label__0 961 . There is a second distinction between the types of cleavage in protostomes and deuterostomes .
__label__0 In addition to spiral cleavage , protostomes also undergo determinate cleavage .
__label__1 This means that even at this early stage , the developmental fate of each embryonic cell is already determined .
__label__1 970 . The invertebrates , or invertebrata , are animals that do not contain bony structures , such as the cranium and vertebrae .
__label__0 The simplest of all the invertebrates are the Parazoans , which include only the phylum Porifera : the sponges ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 696 . Notice that each name is capitalized except for species , and the genus and species names are italicized .
__label__1 Scientists generally refer to an organism only by its genus and species , which is its two - word scientific name , in what is called binomial nomenclature .
__label__0 Therefore , the scientific name of the dog is Canis lupus .
__label__1 726 . Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA .
__label__1 Intermediates of dsRNA , called replicative intermediates , are made in the process of copying the genomic RNA .
__label__1 Multiple , full - length RNA strands of negative polarity ( complimentary to the positive - stranded genomic RNA ) are formed from these intermediates , which may then serve as templates for the production of RNA with positive polarity , including both full - length genomic RNA and shorter viral mRNAs .
__label__1 4225 . The main symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations , delusions , disorganized thinking , disorganized or abnormal motor behavior , and negative symptoms ( APA , 2013 ) .
__label__1 A hallucination is a perceptual experience that occurs in the absence of external stimulation .
__label__1 Auditory hallucinations ( hearing voices ) occur in roughly two - thirds of patients with schizophrenia and are by far the most common form of hallucination ( Andreasen , 1987 ) .
__label__0 6551 . In addition to the factors discussed above that can help overcome collective action problems , external events can sometimes help mobilize groups and potential members .
__label__0 Some scholars argue that disturbance theory can explain why groups mobilize due to an event in the political , economic , or social environment . David Truman .
__label__1 3952 . Social psychology examines how people affect one another , and it looks at the power of the situation .
__label__1 Social psychologists assert that an individual ’s thoughts , feelings , and behaviors are very much influenced by social situations .
__label__1 4153 . In individual therapy , also known as individual psychotherapy or individual counseling , the client and clinician meet one - on - one ( usually from 45 minutes to 1 hour ) .
__label__0 These meetings typically occur weekly or every other week , and sessions are conducted in a confidential and caring environment ( [ link ] ) .
__label__1 3323 . When someone has two copies of the same allele , they are said to be homozygous for that allele .
__label__1 When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene , they are said to be heterozygous .
__label__0 For example , smooth chin is a recessive trait , which means that an individual will only display the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele ( bb).Imagine that a woman with a cleft chin mates with a man with a smooth chin .
__label__0 3359 . Much of what psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in psychological disorders .
__label__0 Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiological causes of behavior assert that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated with imbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems .
__label__0 In this perspective , psychotropic medications can help improve the symptoms associated with these disorders .
__label__0 5221 . High - income countries of the world — primarily the United States , Canada , countries of the European Union , and Japan — subsidize their domestic farmers collectively by about $ 360 billion per year .
__label__0 By contrast , the total amount of foreign aid from these same high - income countries to the poor countries of the world is about $ 70 billion per year , or less than 20 % of the farm subsidies .
__label__0 2130 . Also like the Romans , the Inca were effective administrators .
__label__1 Runners called chasquis traversed the roads in a continuous relay system , ensuring quick communication over long distances .
__label__0 The Inca had no system of writing , however .
__label__0 2142 . The Portuguese traded or sold slaves to Spanish , Dutch , and English colonists in the Americas , particularly in South America and the Caribbean , where sugar was a primary export .
__label__0 Thousands of African slaves found themselves growing , harvesting , and processing sugarcane in an arduous routine of physical labor .
__label__0 Slaves had to cut the long cane stalks by hand and then bring them to a mill , where the cane juice was extracted .
__label__0 6745 . To add further explanation to Article III , Alexander Hamilton wrote details about the federal judiciary in Federalist No. 78 .
__label__0 6850 . These powers stem from the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution , which provides Congress the authority “ to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the Foregoing powers . ”
__label__0 This statement has been used to support the federal government ’s playing a role in controversial policy matters , such as the provision of healthcare , the expansion of power to levy and collect taxes , and regulation of interstate commerce .
__label__1 Finally , Article VI declared that the U.S. Constitution and any laws or treaties made in connection with that document were to supersede constitutions and laws made at the state level .
__label__1 Finally , Article VI declared that the U.S. Constitution and any laws or treaties made in connection with that document were to supersede constitutions and laws made at the state level .
__label__0 This clause , better known as the supremacy clause , makes clear that any conflict in law between the central ( or federal ) government and the regional ( or state ) governments is typically resolved in favor of the central government .
__label__0 Although the U.S. Constitution clearly allocated more power to the federal government than had been the case under the Articles of Confederation , the framers still respected the important role of the states in the new government .
__label__0 6862 . Theorists have long proposed that states are also unique as a function of their differing political cultures , or their attitudes and beliefs about the functions and expectations of the government .
__label__0 In the book , American Federalism : A View from the States , Daniel Elazar first theorized in 1966 that the United States could be divided into three distinct political cultures : moralistic , individualistic , and traditionalistic ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 The diffusion of these cultures throughout the United States is attributed to the migratory patterns of immigrants who settled in and spread out across the country from the east to the west coast .
__label__0 6892 . New York : Atherton Press .
__label__1 A delegate legislator represents the will of those who elected him or her to office and acts in their expressed interest , even when it goes against personal belief about what is ultimately in the constituency ’s best interest .
__label__1 On the other hand , trustees believe they were elected to exercise their own judgment and know best because they have the time and expertise to study and understand an issue .
__label__0 Thus , a trustee will be willing to vote against the desire of the constituency so long as he or she believes it is in the people ’s best interest .
__label__0 6910 . For example , Article II , Section 2 , provides the president the power to appoint officers and department heads .
__label__0 In the following section , the president is further empowered to see that the laws are “ faithfully executed . ”
__label__0 More specifically , Article I , Section 8 , empowers Congress to establish a post office , build roads , regulate commerce , coin money , and regulate the value of money .
__label__0 656 . Mendel followed alleles as they were inherited from parent to offspring .
__label__0 In the early twentieth century , biologists in a field of study known as population genetics began to study how selective forces change a population through changes in allele and genotypic frequencies .
__label__0 659 . It is hard to determine which process dominates because it is often nearly impossible to determine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each occurrence .
__label__1 An event that initiates an allele frequency change in an isolated part of the population , which is not typical of the original population , is called the founder effect .
__label__0 Natural selection , random drift , and founder effects can lead to significant changes in the genome of a population .
__label__0 701 . For example , in [ link ] , all of the organisms in the orange region evolved from a single ancestor that had amniotic eggs .
__label__0 Consequently , all of these organisms also have amniotic eggs and make a single clade , also called a monophyletic group .
__label__0 Clades must include all of the descendants from a branch point .
__label__1 764 . Evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earth ’s existence , the atmosphere was anoxic , meaning that there was no molecular oxygen .
__label__1 Therefore , only those organisms that can grow without oxygen — anaerobic organisms — were able to live .
__label__0 899 . Seedless plants have historically played a role in human life through uses as tools , fuel , and medicine .
__label__0 Dried peat moss , Sphagnum , is commonly used as fuel in some parts of Europe and is considered a renewable resource .
__label__0 Sphagnum bogs ( [ link ] ) are cultivated with cranberry and blueberry bushes .
__label__0 3929 . Consider , for example , a child ’s physical growth : adding inches to her height year by year .
__label__0 In contrast , theorists who view development as discontinuous believe that development takes place in unique stages : It occurs at specific times or ages .
__label__0 With this type of development , the change is more sudden , such as an infant ’s ability to conceive object permanence .
__label__0 3938 . Jean Piaget ( 1896–1980 ) is another stage theorist who studied childhood development ( [ link ] ) .
__label__0 Instead of approaching development from a psychoanalytical or psychosocial perspective , Piaget focused on children ’s cognitive growth .
__label__0 3965 . How did you come to be who you are ?
__label__0 From beginning as a one - cell structure to your birth , your prenatal development occurred in an orderly and delicate sequence .
__label__0 4013 . An especially popular model that describes the dynamics of persuasion is the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion ( Petty & Cacioppo , 1986 ) .
__label__1 The elaboration likelihood model considers the variables of the attitude change approach — that is , features of the source of the persuasive message , contents of the message , and characteristics of the audience are used to determine when attitude change will occur .
__label__0 According to the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion , there are two main routes that play a role in delivering a persuasive message : central and peripheral ( [ link ] ) .
__label__1 4022 . In normative social influence , people conform to the group norm to fit in , to feel good , and to be accepted by the group .
__label__1 However , with informational social influence , people conform because they believe the group is competent and has the correct information , particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous .
__label__0 4046 . People often form judgments and hold expectations about people based on their age .
__label__1 These judgments and expectations can lead to ageism , or prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based solely on their age .
__label__0 Typically , ageism occurs against older adults , but ageism also can occur toward younger adults .
__label__1 309 . Both photosystems have the same basic structure ; a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place .
__label__0 Each photosystem is serviced by the light - harvesting complex , which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center ; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300 – 400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids .
__label__0 The absorption of a single photon or distinct quantity or “ packet ” of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state .
__label__0 390 . Mistakes in the duplication or distribution of the chromosomes lead to mutations that may be passed forward to every new cell produced from an abnormal cell .
__label__0 To prevent a compromised cell from continuing to divide , there are internal control mechanisms that operate at three main cell cycle checkpoints .
__label__1 A checkpoint is one of several points in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which the progression of a cell to the next stage in the cycle can be halted until conditions are favorable .
__label__0 402 . However , because there are two rounds of division , the major process and the stages are designated with a “ I ” or a “ II . ”
__label__1 Thus , meiosis I is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I , prometaphase I , and so on .
__label__1 Meiosis II , in which the second round of meiotic division takes place , includes prophase II , prometaphase II , and so on .
__label__0 6117 . During this period , the Supreme Court ’s decisions regarding the meaning of the Second Amendment were ambiguous at best .
__label__1 In United States v. Miller , the Supreme Court upheld the 1934 National Firearms Act ’s prohibition of sawed - off shotguns , largely on the basis that possession of such a gun was not related to the goal of promoting a “ well regulated militia .
__label__0 ”United States v. Miller , 307 U.S. 174 ( 1939 ) .
__label__0 This finding was generally interpreted as meaning that the Second Amendment protected the right of the states to organize a militia , rather than an individual right , and thus lower courts generally found most firearm regulations — including some city and state laws that virtually outlawed the private ownership of firearms — to be constitutional .
__label__0 6141 . The reexamination of past cases through DNA evidence has revealed dozens in which people were wrongfully executed .
__label__0 Elizabeth Lopatto , “ How Many Innocent People Are Sentenced To Death ? , ” Forbes , 29 April 2014 . http://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethlopatto/2014/04/29/how-many-innocent-people-are-sentenced-to-death/#6e9ae5175cc1 ( March 1 , 2016 ) .
__label__0 For example , Claude Jones was executed for murder based on 1990-era DNA testing of a single hair that was determined at that time to be his ; however , with better DNA testing technology , it was later found to be that of the victim . Dave Mann , “ DNA Tests Undermine Evidence in Texas Execution : New Results Show Claude Jones was Put to Death on Flawed Evidence , ” Texas Observer , 11 November 2010 . http://www.texasobserver.org/texas-observer-exclusive-dna-tests-undermine-evidence-in-texas-execution/ ( March 4 , 2016 ) .
__label__0 Perhaps as a result of this and other cases , seven additional states have abolished capital punishment since 2007 .
__label__0 As of 2015 , nineteen states and the District of Columbia no longer apply the death penalty in new cases , and several other states do not carry out executions despite sentencing people to death . See , for example , “ States With and Without the Death Penalty , ” Death Penalty Information Center , http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-death-penalty ( March 4 , 2016 ) .
__label__0 It remains to be seen whether this gradual trend toward the elimination of the death penalty by the states will continue , or whether the Supreme Court will eventually decide to follow former Justice Harry Blackmun ’s decision to “ no longer … tinker with the machinery of death ” and abolish it completely .
__label__0 6159 . In the modern era , laws and actions that are challenged under strict scrutiny have rarely been upheld .
__label__0 Strict scrutiny , however , was the legal basis for the Supreme Court ’s 1944 upholding of the legality of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II , discussed later in this chapter . Korematsu v. United States , 323 U.S. 214 ( 1944 ) .
__label__0 Finally , affirmative action consists of government programs and policies designed to benefit members of groups historically subject to discrimination .
__label__0 Much of the controversy surrounding affirmative action is about whether strict scrutiny should be applied to these cases .
__label__0 6177 . Although these methods were usually sufficient to ensure that blacks were kept away from the polls , some dedicated African Americans did manage to register to vote despite the obstacles placed in their way .
__label__1 To ensure their vote was largely meaningless , the white elites used their control of the Democratic Party to create the white primary : primary elections in which only whites were allowed to vote .
__label__0 The state party organizations argued that as private groups , rather than part of the state government , they had no obligation to follow the Fifteenth Amendment ’s requirement not to deny the right to vote on the basis of race .
__label__1 6189 . In 1962 , Congress proposed what later became the Twenty - Fourth Amendment , which banned the poll tax in elections to federal ( but not state or local ) office ; the amendment went into effect after being ratified in early 1964 .
__label__1 Several southern states continued to require residents to pay poll taxes in order to vote in state elections until 1966 when , in the case of Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections , the Supreme Court declared that requiring payment of a poll tax in order to vote in an election at any level was unconstitutional . Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections , 383 U.S. 663 ( 1966 ) .
__label__0 2002 .
__label__0 6216 . Stanton and Anthony denounced the Fifteenth Amendment because it granted voting rights only to black men and not to women of any race . Keyssar , 178 .
__label__0 The fight for women ’s rights did not die , however .
__label__1 In 1869 , Stanton and Anthony formed the National Woman Suffrage Association ( NWSA ) , which demanded that the Constitution be amended to grant the right to vote to all women .
__label__0 It also called for more lenient divorce laws and an end to sex discrimination in employment .

__label__1 Earthworms ( annelids ) have slightly more evolved excretory structures called nephridia , illustrated in [ link ] b .
__label__0 A pair of nephridia is present on each segment of the earthworm .
__label__0 1829 . Birds , reptiles , and most terrestrial arthropods convert toxic ammonia to uric acid or the closely related compound guanine ( guano ) instead of urea .
__label__0 Mammals also form some uric acid during breakdown of nucleic acids .
__label__1 1832 . The environment consists of numerous pathogens , which are agents , usually microorganisms , that cause diseases in their hosts .
__label__1 A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen .
__label__1 Pathogens include bacteria , protists , fungi and other infectious organisms .
__label__0 1835 . The immune system has specific cells , described in [ link ] and shown in [ link ] , with receptors that recognize these PAMPs .
__label__1 A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens .
__label__0 Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) .
__label__1 1844 . A mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules , such as histamine , in response to large pathogens .
__label__1 A basophil is a leukocyte that , like a neutrophil , releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in [ link ] .
__label__0 Basophils are also involved in allergy and hypersensitivity responses and induce specific types of inflammatory responses .
__label__0 1889 . During sexual reproduction the genetic material of two individuals is combined to produce genetically diverse offspring that differ from their parents .
__label__0 The genetic diversity of sexually produced offspring is thought to give species a better chance of surviving in an unpredictable or changing environment .
__label__0 1901 . In the male reproductive system , the scrotum houses the testicles or testes ( singular : testis ) , including providing passage for blood vessels , nerves , and muscles related to testicular function .
__label__1 In the male reproductive system , the scrotum houses the testicles or testes ( singular : testis ) , including providing passage for blood vessels , nerves , and muscles related to testicular function .
__label__1 The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones .
__label__0 2 . It becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific method plays a major role in science .
__label__1 The scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation .
__label__0 38 . The forest itself is an ecosystem .
__label__1 An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic , non - living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water .
__label__1 At the highest level of organization ( [ link ] ) , the biosphere is the collection of all ecosystems , and it represents the zones of life on earth .
__label__1 125 . Glycogen is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates and is made up of monomers of glucose .
__label__0 Glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and muscle cells .
__label__0 152 . DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as nucleotides .
__label__1 The nucleotides combine with each other to form a polynucleotide , DNA or RNA .
__label__0 182 . If you examine [ link]b , the diagram of a plant cell , you will see a structure external to the plasma membrane called the cell wall .
__label__1 The cell wall is a rigid covering that protects the cell , provides structural support , and gives shape to the cell .
__label__0 Fungal and protistan cells also have cell walls .
