__label__0 sociologists identify different types of families based on how one enters into them
__label__1 a family of orientation refers to the family into which a person is born
__label__1 a family of procreation describes one that is formed through marriage
__label__1 polygyny refers to a man being married to more than one woman at the same time
__label__1 the reverse  when a woman is married to more than one man at the same time  is called polyandry
__label__0 it is far less common and only occurs in about  percent of the world s cultures  altman and ginat
__label__0 this pattern of tracing kinship is called bilateral descent
__label__1 note that kinship  or one s traceable ancestry  can be based on blood or marriage or adoption
__label__0 sixty percent of societies  mostly modernized nations  follow a bilateral descent pattern
__label__0 while sociologists use the family life cycle to study the dynamics of family over time  consumer and marketing researchers have used it to determine what goods and services families need as they progress through each stage  murphy and staples
__label__0 as early  stage  theories have been criticized for generalizing family life and not accounting for differences in gender  ethnicity  culture  and lifestyle  less rigid models of the family life cycle have been developed
__label__1 one example is the family life course  which recognizes the events that occur in the lives of families but views them as parting terms of a fluid course rather than in consecutive stages  strong and devault
__label__0 this type of model accounts for changes in family development  such as the fact that in today s society  childbearing does not always occur with marriage
__label__1 a denomination is a large  mainstream religious organization  but it does not claim to be official or state sponsored
__label__0 it is one religion among many
__label__1 this story illustrates a growing concern referred to as grade inflation  a term used to describe the observation that the correspondence between letter grades and the achievements they reflect has been changing  in a downward direction  over time
__label__0 put simply  what used to be considered c  level  or average  now often earns a student a b  or even an a
__label__0 europe s feudal society was a mutually supportive system
__label__1 the lords owned the land  knights gave military service to a lord and carried out his justice  serfs worked the land in return for the protection offered by the lord s castle or the walls of his city  into which they fled in times of danger from invaders
__label__0 huge storehouses were filled with food for times of need
__label__1 each peasant also worked for the inca ruler a number of days per month on public works projects  a requirement known as the mita
__label__0 for example  peasants constructed rope bridges made of grass to span the mountains above fast  flowing icy rivers
__label__0 in reality  the encomienda system exploited native workers
__label__1 it was eventually replaced by another colonial labor system  the repartimiento  which required indian towns to supply a pool of labor for spanish overlords
__label__1 conservative whigs believed in government by a patrician class  a ruling group composed of a small number of privileged families
__label__1 conservative whigs believed in government by a patrician class  a ruling group composed of a small number of privileged families
__label__1 radical whigs favored broadening the popular participation in political life and pushed for democracy
__label__0 the great debate after independence was secured centered on this question  who should rule in the new american republic
__label__0 for   million  a bargain price  considering the amount of land involved  the united states doubled in size
__label__1 perhaps the greatest real estate deal in american history  the louisiana purchase greatly enhanced the jeffersonian vision of the united states as an agrarian republic in which yeomen farmers worked the land
__label__0 jefferson also wanted to bolster trade in the west  seeing the port of new orleans and the mississippi river  then the western boundary of the united states  as crucial to american agricultural commerce
__label__1 specialization meant the work was broken down into specific tasks  and workers repeatedly did the one task assigned to them in the course of a day
__label__0 as machines took over labor from humans and people increasingly found themselves confined to the same repetitive step  the process of deskilling began
__label__0 in   tennessee  born william walker  along with an army of no more than sixty mercenaries  gained control of the central american nation of nicaragua
__label__0 previously  walker had launched a successful invasion of mexico  dubbing his conquered land the republic of sonora
__label__0 in a relatively short period of time  walker was dislodged from sonora by mexican authorities and forced to retreat back to the united states
__label__1 state and federal challenges arose  due to the obvious appearance of a monopoly  which implied sole ownership of all enterprises composing an entire industry
__label__0 when the ohio supreme court ruled that the standard oil company must dissolve  as its monopoly control over all refining operations in the us was in violation of state and federal statutes  rockefeller shifted to yet another legal entity  called a holding company model
__label__1 the holding company model created a central corporate entity that controlled the operations of multiple companies by holding the majority of stock for each enterprise
__label__0 the line between the people s right to know and national security is not always clear
__label__0 in   the supreme court heard the pentagon papers case  in which the us government sued the new york times and the washington post to stop the release of information from a classified study of the vietnam war
__label__0 the supreme court ruled that while the government can impose prior restraint on the media  meaning the government can prevent the publication of information  that right is very limited
__label__0 during the civil war  journalists expected to have access to those representing the government  including the military
__label__0 but william tecumseh sherman  a union general  maintained distance between the press and his military
__label__0 following the publication of material sherman believed to be protected by government censorship  a journalist was arrested and nearly put to death
__label__0 because white house limitations on the press are not unusual  many journalists rely on confidential sources
__label__0 in   under the cloak of anonymity  the associate director of the federal bureau of investigation  mark felt  became a news source for bob woodward and carl bernstein  political reporters at the washington post
__label__0 felt provided information about a number of potential stories and was woodward s main source for information about president richard nixon s involvement in a series of illegal activities  including the break  in at democratic party headquarters in washington s watergate office complex

__label__1 the secretary of state is the nation s chief diplomat  serves in the president s cabinet  and oversees the foreign service
__label__1 the secretary of defense  who is the civilian  nonmilitary  head of the armed services housed in the department of defense  is also a key cabinet member for foreign policy  as mentioned above
__label__0 a third cabinet secretary  the secretary of homeland security  is critically important in foreign policy  overseeing the massive department of homeland security   link
__label__0 in the twenty  first century  neo  isolationism means distancing the united states from the united nations and other international organizations that get in the way
__label__1 the strategy of selective engagement  retaining a strong military presence and remaining engaged across the world through alliances and formal installations  is used to protect the national security interests of the united states
__label__0 however  this strategy also seeks to avoid being the world s policeman
__label__0 its goal was to unite gay men who otherwise lived in secrecy and to fight against abuse
__label__1 the mattachine society often worked with the daughters of bilitis  a lesbian rights organization
__label__0 among the early issues targeted by the mattachine society was police entrapment of male homosexuals
__label__0 see vern l bullough
__label__1 other delusions include the belief that one s thoughts are being removed  thought withdrawal  or thoughts have been placed inside one s head  thought insertion
__label__1 another type of delusion is somatic delusion  which is the belief that something highly abnormal is happening to one s body  eg  that one s kidneys are being eaten by cockroaches
__label__1 people with obsessive  compulsive disorder  ocd  experience thoughts and urges that are intrusive and unwanted  obsessions  andor the need to engage in repetitive behaviors or mental acts  compulsions
__label__0 a person with this disorder might  for example  spend hours each day washing his hands or constantly checking and rechecking to make sure that a stove  faucet  or light has been turned off
__label__0 specific phobias are common  in the united states  around   of the population will meet the criteria for a specific phobia at some point in their lifetime  kessler et al
__label__0 one type of phobia  agoraphobia  is listed in the dsm as a separate anxiety disorder
__label__1 agoraphobia  which literally means  fear of the marketplace   is characterized by intense fear  anxiety  and avoidance of situations in which it might be difficult to escape or receive help if one experiences symptoms of a panic attack  a state of extreme anxiety that we will discuss shortly
__label__0 indeed  england could not commit to large  scale colonization in the americas as long as spain appeared ready to invade ireland or scotland
__label__1 nonetheless  elizabeth approved of english privateers  sea captains to whom the home government had given permission to raid the enemy at will
__label__0 these skilled mariners cruised the caribbean  plundering spanish ships whenever they could
__label__0 parliament did not enact the tea act of  in order to punish the colonists  assert parliamentary power  or even raise revenues
__label__0 rather  the act was a straightforward order of economic protectionism for a british tea firm  the east india company  that was on the verge of bankruptcy
__label__1 during the war of   the bank of the united states had suspended payments in specie   hard money  usually in the form of gold and silver coins
__label__0 when the war ended  the bank continued to issue only paper banknotes and to redeem notes issued by state banks with paper only
__label__0 it s easy to get confused about two fields that study the interaction of genes and the environment  such as the fields of evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics
__label__0 how can we tell them apart
__label__1 dna is a helix  shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs
__label__1 in each chromosome  sequences of dna make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible characteristics  known as traits  such as eye color  hair color  and so on
__label__1 in each chromosome  sequences of dna make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible characteristics  known as traits  such as eye color  hair color  and so on
__label__1 a single gene may have multiple possible variations  or alleles
__label__1 between signals  the neuron membrane s potential is held in a state of readiness  called the resting potential
__label__1 like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action  ions line up on either side of the cell membrane  ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates  ie  a sodium  potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane
__label__0 ions in high  concentration areas are ready to move to low  concentration areas  and positive ions are ready to move to areas with a negative charge  in the resting state  sodium  na  is at higher concentrations outside the cell  so it will tend to move into the cell
__label__0 if you look around carefully  you will see that scarcity is a fact of life
__label__1 scarcity means that human wants for goods  services and resources exceed what is available
__label__0 resources  such as labor  tools  land  and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply
__label__1 first  specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage
__label__0 in later chapters  we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage
__label__0 times
__label__0 the distance separating the two strands that make up the dna structure is about  nm  while the distance separating the individual atoms within each base is about  nm
__label__0 one might wonder why electrostatic forces do not play a larger role in biology than they do if we have so many charged molecules
__label__0 the reason is that the electrostatic force is  diluted  due to screening between molecules
__label__0 this is due to the presence of other charges in the cell
__label__0 a few voltage sources are shown in  link
__label__0 all such devices create a potential difference and can supply current if connected to a resistance
__label__0 on the small scale  the potential difference creates an electric field that exerts force on charges  causing current
__label__1 kirchhoff s first rule  the junction rule  is an application of the conservation of charge to a junction  it is illustrated in  link
__label__0 current is the flow of charge  and charge is conserved  thus  whatever charge flows into the junction must flow out
__label__0 thinking of the molecules as many slits  analogous to those for the oscillating ropes  we can understand why only light with a specific polarization can get through
__label__1 the axis of a polarizing filter is the direction along which the filter passes the electric field of an em wave  see  link
__label__1 the slender arrow represents a ray of unpolarized light
__label__1 the bold arrows represent the direction of polarization of the individual waves composing the ray
__label__1 inductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion
__label__0 this type of reasoning is common in descriptive science
__label__1 bilateral symmetry involves the division of the animal through a sagittal plane  resulting in two mirror image  right and left halves  such as those of a butterfly   linkd   crab  or human body
__label__1 animals with bilateral symmetry have a  head  and  tail   anterior vs posterior   front and back  dorsal vs ventral   and right and left sides   link
__label__1 soil particles that are  to  mm in diameter are sand
__label__1 soil particles between  and  mm are called silt  and even smaller particles  less than  mm in diameter  are called clay
__label__1 some soils have no dominant particle size and contain a mixture of sand  silt  and humus  these soils are called loams
__label__1 as the seed germinates  the primary root emerges  protected by the root  tip covering  the coleorhiza
__label__1 next  the primary shoot emerges  protected by the coleoptile  the covering of the shoot tip

__label__0 neural control of thermoregulationthe nervous system is important to thermoregulation  as illustrated in  link
__label__0 the processes of homeostasis and temperature control are centered in the hypothalamus of the advanced animal brain
__label__0 a large part of digestion occurs in the stomach  shown in  link
__label__1 the stomach is a saclike organ that secretes gastric digestive juices
__label__0 the ph in the stomach is between  and
__label__0 it should be clear by now that economics covers a lot of ground
__label__1 that ground can be divided into two parts  microeconomics focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy  like households  workers  and businesses  macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole
__label__0 it focuses on broad issues such as growth of production  the number of unemployed people  the inflationary increase in prices  government deficits  and levels of exports and imports
__label__0 command economies are very different
__label__1 in a command economy  economic effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class
__label__0 ancient egypt was a good example  a large part of economic life was devoted to building pyramids  like those shown in  link   for the pharaohs
__label__1 economists use the term demand to refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price
__label__0 demand is based on needs and wants  a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want  but from an economist s perspective they are the same thing
__label__0 the simplest example of a rate of return is the interest rate
__label__0 for example  when you supply money into a savings account at a bank  you receive interest on your deposit
__label__0 the decision  making process of a utility  maximizing household applies to what quantity of hours to work in much the same way that it applies to purchases of goods and services
__label__0 choices made along the labor  leisure budget constraint  as wages shift  provide the logical underpinning for the labor supply curve
__label__0 the discussion also offers some insights about the range of possible reactions when people receive higher wages  and specifically about the claim that if people are paid higher wages  they will work a greater quantity of hours  assuming that they have a say in the matter
__label__0 similarly  adam smith  a scottish philosopher who was born nineteen years after locke s death  believed that all people should be free to acquire property in any way that they wished
__label__0 instead of being controlled by government  business  and industry  smith argued  people should be allowed to operate as they wish and keep the proceeds of their work
__label__1 government also performs the important job of protecting common goods  goods that all people may use free of charge but that are of limited supply  such as fish in the sea or clean drinking water
__label__0 because everyone can use these goods  they must be protected so a few people do not take everything that is available and leave others with nothing
__label__0 some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature
__label__1 under totalitarianism  the government is more important than the citizens  and it controls all aspects of citizens  lives
__label__0 citizens  rights are limited  and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition
__label__0 in   the supreme court declared for itself the power of judicial review  a power to which hamilton had referred but that is not expressly mentioned in the constitution
__label__1 judicial review is the power of the courts  as part of the system of checks and balances  to look at actions taken by the other branches of government and the states and determine whether they are constitutional
__label__0 consider health care  for example
__label__0 in   president barack obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  aca   a statute that brought significant changes to the nation s healthcare system
__label__0 with its goal of providing more widely attainable and affordable health insurance and health care   obamacare  was hailed by some but soundly denounced by others as bad policy
__label__0 the judiciary today continues as a dual court system  with courts at both the national and state levels
__label__0 both levels have three basic tiers consisting of trial courts  appellate courts  and finally courts of last resort  typically called supreme courts  at the top   link
__label__0 decisions of the higher courts are binding on the lower courts
__label__0 the precedent set by each ruling  particularly by the supreme court s decisions  both builds on principles and guidelines set by earlier cases and frames the ongoing operation of the courts  steering the direction of the entire system
__label__0 reliance on precedent has enabled the federal courts to operate with logic and consistency that has helped validate their role as the key interpreters of the constitution and the law  a legitimacy particularly vital in the united states where citizens do not elect federal judges and justices but are still subject to their rulings
__label__0 the circuit courts started out as the trial courts for most federal criminal cases and for some civil suits  including those initiated by the united states and those involving citizens of different states
__label__0 but early on  they did not have their own judges  the local district judge and two supreme court justices formed each circuit court panel
__label__0 american judicature society and malia reddick  httpwwwamericanbarorgcontentdamabamigratedjusticecenterjusticepublicdocumentsjudicialselectionroadmapauthcheckdampdf
__label__0 the president s nominee is then discussed  and sometimes hotly debated  in the senate judiciary committee
__label__0 after a committee vote  the candidate must be confirmed by a majority vote of the full senate
__label__0 and even on the present  day court  anthony kennedy  a reagan appointee  has become notorious as the court s swing vote  sometimes siding with the more conservative justices but sometimes not
__label__0 current chief justice john roberts  though most typically an ardent member of the court s more conservative wing  has twice voted to uphold provisions of the affordable care act
__label__0 sandra day oconnor
__label__1 in addition  approximately  percent of governors have the power of an amendatory veto  which allows them to send a bill back to the legislature and request a specific amendment to it
__label__1 finally  a small number of governors  including the governor of texas  also have the power of a reduction veto  which allows them to reduce the budget proposed in a piece of legislation
__label__0 national conference of state legislatures   the veto process   in general legislative procedures
__label__0 each remained convinced that its own economic and political systems were superior to the other s  and the two superpowers quickly found themselves drawn into conflict
__label__1 the decades  long struggle between them for technological and ideological supremacy became known as the cold war
__label__0 so called because it did not include direct military confrontation between soviet and us troops  the cold war was fought with a variety of other weapons  espionage and surveillance  political assassinations  propaganda  and the formation of alliances with other nations
__label__1 as communist governments came to power elsewhere in the world  american policymakers extended their strategy of containment to what became known as the domino theory under the eisenhower administration  neighbors to communist nations  so was the assumption  were likely to succumb to the same allegedly dangerous and infectious ideology
__label__0 like dominos toppling one another  entire regions would eventually be controlled by the soviets
__label__0 in keeping with his goal of a balanced budget  eisenhower switched the emphasis in defense from larger conventional forces to greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons
__label__1 his new look strategy embraced nuclear  massive retaliation   a plan for nuclear response to a first soviet strike so devastating that the attackers would not be able to respond
__label__1 his new look strategy embraced nuclear  massive retaliation   a plan for nuclear response to a first soviet strike so devastating that the attackers would not be able to respond
__label__0 some labeled this approach  mutually assured destruction  or mad
__label__0 some party factions hoped to make their voices heard  others wished to disrupt the convention altogether
__label__1 among them were antiwar protestors  hippies  and yippies  members of the leftist  anarchistic youth international party organized by jerry rubin and abbie hoffman  who called for the establishment of a new nation consisting of cooperative institutions to replace those currently in existence
__label__0 to demonstrate their contempt for  the establishment  and the proceedings inside the hall  the yippies nominated a pig named pigasus for president
__label__1 in some soils  the b horizon contains nodules or a layer of calcium carbonate
__label__1 the c horizon  or soil base  includes the parent material  plus the organic and inorganic material that is broken down to form soil
__label__0 the parent material may be either created in its natural place  or transported from elsewhere to its present location
__label__0 animals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the different foods they consume
__label__0 the simplest example is that of a gastrovascular cavity and is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion
__label__0 platyhelminthes  flatworms   ctenophora  comb jellies   and cnidaria  coral  jelly fish  and sea anemones  use this type of digestion
__label__1 the second part of the small intestine is called the jejunum  shown in  link
__label__0 here  hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining
__label__1 a class system is based on both social factors and individual achievement
__label__1 a class consists of a set of people who share similar status with regard to factors like wealth  income  education  and occupation
__label__0 in turn  those parents may have been raised in the lower class
__label__0 patterns of intergenerational mobility can reflect long  term societal changes
__label__1 similarly  intragenerational mobility refers to changes in a person s social mobility over the course of his or her lifetime
__label__0 for example  the wealth and prestige experienced by one person may be quite different from that of his or her siblings
__label__1 structural mobility happens when societal changes enable a whole group of people to move up or down the social class ladder
__label__0 as women approach their mids to mids  their ovaries begin to lose their sensitivity to fsh and lh
__label__1 menstrual periods become less frequent and finally cease  this is menopause
__label__0 there are still eggs and potential follicles on the ovaries  but without the stimulation of fsh and lh  they will not produce a viable egg to be released
__label__0 the first of these is the milankovitch cycles
__label__1 the milankovitch cycles describe the effects of slight changes in the earth s orbit on earth s climate
__label__0 the length of the milankovitch cycles ranges between  and  years
__label__0 in each of these situations  an object has a velocity relative to a medium  such as a river  and that medium has a velocity relative to an observer on solid ground
__label__0 the velocity of the object relative to the observer is the sum of these velocity vectors  as indicated in  link  and  link
__label__0 unfortunately  this is impossible
__label__0 the second law of thermodynamics also states  with regard to using heat transfer to do work  the second expression of the second law
__label__0 you may have noticed that dogs respond to the sound of a dog whistle which produces sound out of the range of human hearing
__label__0 elephants are known to respond to frequencies below  hz
__label__1 the perception of frequency is called pitch
__label__0 most of us have excellent relative pitch  which means that we can tell whether one sound has a different frequency from another
__label__0 see  link
__label__0 in this experiment  franklin demonstrated a connection between lightning and static electricity
__label__0 sparks were drawn from a key hung on a kite string during an electrical storm
__label__0 remember that in classical conditioning  something in the environment triggers a reflex automatically  and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus
__label__0 now we turn to the second type of associative learning  operant conditioning
__label__1 in operant conditioning  organisms learn to associate a behavior and its consequence   link
__label__0 each time the rat hit the lever  a pellet of food came out
__label__1 when an organism receives a reinforcer each time it displays a behavior  it is called continuous reinforcement
__label__0 this reinforcement schedule is the quickest way to teach someone a behavior  and it is especially effective in training a new behavior
__label__1 an event schema  also known as a cognitive script  is a set of behaviors that can feel like a routine
__label__0 think about what you do when you walk into an elevator   link
__label__1 working backwards is a useful heuristic in which you begin solving the problem by focusing on the end result
__label__0 consider this example  you live in washington  dc and have been invited to a wedding at  pm on saturday in philadelphia
__label__1 contact forces  such as between a baseball and a bat  are explained on the small scale by the interaction of the charges in atoms and molecules in close proximity
__label__0 they interact through forces that include the coulomb force
__label__0 action at a distance is a force between objects that are not close enough for their atoms to  touch
__label__0 that is  they are separated by more than a few atomic diameters
__label__0 polarity of water moleculesthe best example of this charge screening is the water molecule  represented as ho ho
__label__0 water is a strongly polar molecule
__label__1 its  electrons   from the oxygen atom and  from the two hydrogen atoms  tend to remain closer to the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nuclei
__label__0 radar is a common application of microwaves that was first developed in world war ii
__label__0 by detecting and timing microwave echoes  radar systems can determine the distance to objects as diverse as clouds and aircraft
__label__1 many crystals and solutions rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through them
__label__0 such substances are said to be optically active
__label__0 examples include sugar water  insulin  and collagen  see  link
__label__0 the michelson  morley experiment demonstrated that the speed of light in a vacuum is independent of the motion of the earth about the sun
__label__0 this can be observed with a microscope for any small particles in a fluid
__label__1 the motion is caused by the random thermal motions of fluid molecules colliding with particles in the fluid  and it is now called brownian motion
__label__0 see  link
__label__0 link  shows an energy  level diagram  a convenient way to display energy states
__label__0 in the present discussion  we take these to be the allowed energy levels of the electron
__label__1 triploblasts that do not develop a coelom are called acoelomates  and their mesoderm region is completely filled with tissue  although they do still have a gut cavity
__label__0 examples of acoelomates include animals in the phylum platyhelminthes  also known as flatworms
__label__1 the lepidosaurs include modern lizards  snakes  and tuataras
__label__1 the archosaurs include modern crocodiles and alligators  and the extinct pterosaurs   winged lizard   and dinosaurs   terrible lizard
__label__1 clade dinosauria includes birds  which evolved from a branch of dinosaurs
__label__0 art connection
__label__0 squamata   scaly   arose in the late permian  and extant species include lizards and snakes
__label__0 both are found on all continents except antarctica
__label__1 this arboreal heritage of primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for brachiation  or climbing and swinging through trees
__label__1 these adaptations include  but are not limited to    a rotating shoulder joint    a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs  which are widely separated from fingers  except humans   which allow for gripping branches    stereoscopic vision  two overlapping fields of vision from the eyes  which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance
__label__0 other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of most other mammals  claws that have been modified into flattened nails  typically only one offspring per pregnancy  and a trend toward holding the body upright
__label__0 several species evolved from the evolutionary branch that includes humans  although our species is the only surviving member
__label__1 the term hominin is used to refer to those species that evolved after this split of the primate line  thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees
__label__0 hominins were predominantly bipedal and include those groups that likely gave rise to our species  including australopithecus  homo habilis  and homo erectus  and those non  ancestral groups that can be considered  cousins  of modern humans  such as neanderthals
__label__0 there is considerable debate about the origins of anatomically modern humans or homo sapiens sapiens
__label__0 as discussed earlier  h erectus migrated out of africa and into asia and europe in the first major wave of migration about  million years ago
__label__0 plants can tell the time of day and time of year by sensing and using various wavelengths of sunlight
__label__1 phototropism is a directional response that allows plants to grow towards  or even away from  light
__label__0 when blood glucose levels decline below normal levels  for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly during exercise  the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas
__label__1 glucagon raises blood glucose levels  eliciting what is called a hyperglycemic effect  by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in skeletal muscle cells and liver cells in a process called glycogenolysis
__label__1 some movements that can not be classified as gliding  angular  or rotational are called special movements
__label__1 inversion involves the soles of the feet moving inward  toward the midline of the body
__label__1 eversion is the opposite of inversion  movement of the sole of the foot outward  away from the midline of the body
__label__1 globalization refers to the process of integrating governments  cultures  and financial markets through international trade into a single world market
__label__0 often  the process begins with a single motive  such as market expansion  on the part of a corporation  or increased access to healthcare  on the part of a nonprofit organization
__label__0 though family and other societal models help guide a person toward a career  personal choice plays a role
__label__1 in class systems  people have the option to form exogamous marriages  unions of spouses from different social categories
__label__0 marriage in these circumstances is based on values such as love and compatibility rather than on social standing or economics
__label__0 these differences are based on cultural attitudes toward aging
__label__0 in china  several studies have noted the attitude of filial piety  deference and respect to one s parents and ancestors in all things  as defining all other virtues  hsu   hamilton
__label__0 cultural attitudes in japan prior to approximately  supported the idea that the elderly deserve assistance  ogawa and retherford
__label__1 the earliest gerontological theory in the functionalist perspective is disengagement theory  which suggests that withdrawing from society and social relationships is a natural part of growing old
__label__0 there are several main points to the theory
__label__0 not even sociologists are able to agree on a single meaning
__label__1 for our purposes  we ll define marriage as a legally recognized social contract between two people  traditionally based on a sexual relationship and implying a permanence of the union
__label__0 in practicing cultural relativism  we should also consider variations  such as whether a legal union is required  think of  common law  marriage and its equivalents   or whether more than two people can be involved  consider polygamy
__label__0 infants are also often victims of physical abuse  particularly in the form of violent shaking
__label__1 this type of physical abuse is referred to as shaken  baby syndrome  which describes a group of medical symptoms such as brain swelling and retinal hemorrhage resulting from forcefully shaking or causing impact to an infant s head
__label__0 a baby s cry is the number one trigger for shaking
__label__0 ultimately  of course  the issue was decided by the civil war       with the southern states seceding to defend their  states  rights  to determine their own destinies without interference by the federal government

__label__0 in some states  poorer  less literate white voters feared being disenfranchised by the literacy and understanding tests
__label__0 some states introduced a loophole  known as the grandfather clause  to allow less literate whites to vote
__label__1 the grandfather clause exempted those who had been allowed to vote in that state prior to the civil war and their descendants from literacy and understanding tests  keyssar
__label__0 because blacks were not allowed to vote prior to the civil war  but most white men had been voting at a time when there were no literacy tests  this loophole allowed most illiterate whites to vote   link   while leaving obstacles in place for blacks who wanted to vote as well
__label__0 thus  if a white family chose to sell its house to a black family and the other homeowners in the neighborhood tried to sue the seller  the court would not hear the case
__label__0 in   the supreme court struck down a virginia law that prohibited interracial marriage in loving v virginia  loving v virginia   us

__label__0 a magazine might run a story on climate change by interviewing representatives of only one side of the policy debate and downplaying the opposing view  all without acknowledging the one  sided nature of its coverage
__label__0 in contrast  when the writer or publication makes clear to the reader or viewer that the information offers only one side of the political debate  the political message is overt content
__label__0 political commentators like rush limbaugh and publications like mother jones openly state their ideological viewpoints
__label__0 the first opinion poll was taken in   it asked voters how they voted as they left their polling places
__label__1 informal polls are called straw polls  and they informally collect opinions of a non  random population or group
__label__0 newspapers and social media continue the tradition of unofficial polls  mainly because interested readers want to know how elections will end

__label__0 however  if you wanted to understand the typical weather pattern in chicago  instead of focusing on one  time extremes  you would need to look at the entire pattern of data over time
__label__0 a similar lesson applies to the study of macroeconomics
__label__0 it is interesting to study extreme situations  like the great depression of the s or what many have called the great recession of
__label__0 if you want to understand the whole picture  however  you need to look at the long term
__label__0 the population more than tripled in the twentieth century  from  million in  to over  million in
__label__0 the human capital of modern workers is far higher today because the education and skills of workers have risen dramatically
__label__0 in   only about one  eighth of the us population had completed high school and just one person in  had completed a four  year college degree
__label__0 monetary policy affects the economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length
__label__0 remember  monetary policy involves a chain of events  the central bank must perceive a situation in the economy  hold a meeting  and make a decision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy
__label__0 the change in monetary policy must percolate through the banking system  changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates
__label__0 most central bankers believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long term
__label__0 remember that in the neoclassical model of the economy  the aggregate supply curve is drawn as a vertical line at the level of potential gdp  as shown in  link
__label__0 in the neoclassical model  the level of potential gdp  and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential gdp  is determined by real economic factors
__label__0 link  also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and demand diagrams in the foreign exchange market
__label__0 in contrast to all the other cases of supply and demand you have considered  in the foreign exchange market  supply and demand typically both move at the same time
__label__0 groups of participants in the foreign exchange market like firms and investors include some who are buyers and some who are sellers
__label__0 every nation would prefer a stable exchange rate to facilitate international trade and reduce the degree of risk and uncertainty in the economy
__label__0 however  a nation may sometimes want a weaker exchange rate to stimulate aggregate demand and reduce a recession  or a stronger exchange rate to fight inflation
__label__0 there is also no particular reason to expect a government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few years
__label__0 for example  a government may decide that by running large budget deficits  it can make crucial long  term investments in human capital and physical infrastructure that will build the long  term productivity of a country
__label__0 these decisions may work out well or poorly  but they are not always irrational
__label__0 a larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital
__label__0 if private saving and the trade balance remain the same  then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital
__label__1 when government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital  the result is known as crowding out
__label__0 to understand the potential impact of crowding out  consider the situation of the us economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late
__label__0 the national economies that make up the global economy are remarkably diverse
__label__0 let us use one key indicator of the standard of living  gdp per capita  to quantify this diversity
__label__0 you will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations
__label__0 for unemployment caused by a recession  the keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available
__label__0 the monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward  run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans  drive down interest rates  and increase aggregate demand
__label__0 in a recession  there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off  and so even a central bank  with fighting inflation as its top priority  can usually justify some reduction in interest rates
__label__0 with regard to fiscal policy  the automatic stabilizers discussed in government budgets and fiscal policy should be allowed to work  even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession
__label__0 however  any nation that is experiencing a substantial and sustained pattern of trade deficits  along with the corresponding net inflow of international financial capital  has some reason for concern
__label__0 during the asian financial crisis in the late s  countries that grew dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis as international capital flowed in  saw their economies collapse when the capital very quickly flowed out
__label__0 in   david ricardo  a businessman  economist  and member of the british parliament  wrote a treatise called on the principles of political economy and taxation
__label__1 in this treatise  ricardo argued that specialization and free trade benefit all trading partners  even those that may be relatively inefficient
__label__1 a labor union is an organization of workers that negotiates with employers over wages and working conditions
__label__0 a labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to deal with workers collectively  rather than as individuals
__label__1 affirmative action is the name given to active efforts by government or businesses that give special rights to minorities in hiring and promotion to make up for past discrimination
__label__0 affirmative action  in its limited and not especially controversial form  means making an effort to reach out to a broader range of minority candidates for jobs
__label__0 driving a certain car  drinking a particular soda  or wearing a certain shoe are all unlikely to bring fashionable friends and fun automatically  if at all
__label__0 the government rules on advertising  enforced by the federal trade commission  ftc   allow advertising to contain a certain amount of exaggeration about the general delight of using a product
__label__0 they  however  also demand that if a claim is presented as a fact  it must be true
__label__1 an intermediary is one who stands between two other parties  for example  a person who arranges a blind date between two other people is one kind of intermediary
__label__1 in financial capital markets  banks are an example of a financial intermediary  that is  an institution that operates between a saver who deposits funds in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank
__label__0 when a bank serves as a financial intermediary  unlike the situation with a couple on a blind date  the saver and the borrower never meet
__label__0 malpighian tubules of insects
__label__0 malpighian tubules are found lining the gut of some species of arthropods  such as the bee illustrated in  link
__label__0 they are usually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect
__label__1 prrs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment
__label__1 a monocyte is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected tissue
__label__0 dendritic cells bind molecular signatures of pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction
__label__0 a negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit the release of gnrh  fsh  and lh
__label__1 the sertoli cells produce the hormone inhibin  which is released into the blood when the sperm count is too high
__label__0 this inhibits the release of gnrh and fsh  which will cause spermatogenesis to slow down
__label__1 the cells in the blastula rearrange themselves spatially to form three layers of cells
__label__0 this process is called gastrulation
__label__0 during gastrulation  the blastula folds upon itself to form the three layers of cells
__label__0 no species exists everywhere  for example  the venus flytrap is endemic to a small area in north and south carolina
__label__1 an endemic species is one which is naturally found only in a specific geographic area that is usually restricted in size
__label__1 other species are generalists  species which live in a wide variety of geographic areas  the raccoon  for example  is native to most of north and central america
__label__0 the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere  the more thermal energy is reflected back to the earth s surface
__label__1 greenhouse gases absorb and emit radiation and are an important factor in the greenhouse effect  the warming of earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  evidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and temperature  as carbon dioxide rises  global temperature rises
__label__1 greenhouse gases absorb and emit radiation and are an important factor in the greenhouse effect  the warming of earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  evidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and temperature  as carbon dioxide rises  global temperature rises
__label__0 since   the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from about  ppm to  ppm in
__label__0 many of these tools were originally designed to study human populations
__label__1 for example  life tables  which detail the life expectancy of individuals within a population  were initially developed by life insurance companies to set insurance rates
__label__0 in fact  while the term  demographics  is commonly used when discussing humans  all living populations can be studied using this approach
__label__0 efforts to control population growth led to the one  child policy in china  which used to include more severe consequences  but now imposes fines on urban couples who have more than one child
__label__0 due to the fact that some couples wish to have a male heir  many chinese couples continue to have more than one child
__label__1 foundation species are considered the  base  or  bedrock  of a community  having the greatest influence on its overall structure
__label__1 they are usually the primary producers  organisms that bring most of the energy into the community
__label__0 for example  the study of island biogeography attempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains  including the galpagos islands that inspired the young darwin
__label__1 relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a habitat  ecosystem  or biome
__label__0 foundation species often have the highest relative abundance of species
__label__0 for these reasons  scientists study ecosystems under more controlled conditions
__label__1 experimental systems usually involve either partitioning a part of a natural ecosystem that can be used for experiments  termed a mesocosm  or by re  creating an ecosystem entirely in an indoor or outdoor laboratory environment  which is referred to as a microcosm
__label__0 a major limitation to these approaches is that removing individual organisms from their natural ecosystem or altering a natural ecosystem through partitioning may change the dynamics of the ecosystem
__label__1 net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level
__label__1 assimilation is the biomass  energy content generated per unit area  of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food  energy used for respiration  and energy lost as waste

__label__0 link  illustrates the average time that an individual water molecule may spend in the earth s major water reservoirs
__label__1 residence time is a measure of the average time an individual water molecule stays in a particular reservoir
__label__0 a large amount of the earth s water is locked in place in these reservoirs as ice  beneath the ground  and in the ocean  and  thus  is unavailable for short  term cycling  only surface water can evaporate
__label__0 atmospheric nitrogen is associated with several effects on earth s ecosystems including the production of acid rain  as nitric acid  hno  and greenhouse gas  as nitrous oxide  no  potentially causing climate change
__label__1 a major effect from fertilizer runoff is saltwater and freshwater eutrophication  a process whereby nutrient runoff causes the excess growth of microorganisms  depleting dissolved oxygen levels and killing ecosystem fauna
__label__0 a characteristic like cleft chin  for example  is influenced by a single gene from each parent
__label__1 in this example  we will call the gene for cleft chin  b   and the gene for smooth chin  b  cleft chin is a dominant trait  which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent  bb  or both parents  bb  will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele
__label__1 when someone has two copies of the same allele  they are said to be homozygous for that allele
__label__1 when someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene  they are said to be heterozygous
__label__0 for example  smooth chin is a recessive trait  which means that an individual will only display the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele  bbimagine that a woman with a cleft chin mates with a man with a smooth chin
__label__0 what type of chin will their child have
__label__0 computer software is used to analyze the vast amount of data generated for proteomic analysis
__label__0 genomic  and proteomic  scale analyses are part of systems biology
__label__1 systems biology is the study of whole biological systems  genomes and proteomes  based on interactions within the system
__label__0 the european bioinformatics institute and the human proteome organization  hupo  are developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous pile of systems biology data
__label__0 this definition also includes re  emerging diseases that were previously under control
__label__1 approximately  percent of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are zoonotic diseases  zoonoses  diseases that primarily infect animals and are transmitted to humans  some are of viral origin and some are of bacterial origin
__label__1 brucellosis is an example of a prokaryotic zoonosis that is re  emerging in some regions  and necrotizing fasciitis  commonly known as flesh  eating bacteria  has been increasing in virulence for the last  years for unknown reasons
__label__0 the map shows regions where bacterial diseases are emerging or reemerging
__label__0 as cell biology developed in the twentieth century  it became clear that mitochondria were the organelles responsible for producing atp using aerobic respiration
__label__1 in the s  american biologist lynn margulis developed endosymbiotic theory  which states that eukaryotes may have been a product of one cell engulfing another  one living within another  and evolving over time until the separate cells were no longer recognizable as such
__label__0 in   margulis introduced new work on the theory and substantiated her findings through microbiological evidence
__label__0 they vary in their oxygen requirement
__label__1 most fungi are obligate aerobes  requiring oxygen to survive
__label__1 other species  such as the chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle  are are obligate anaerobes  in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them
__label__0 but baryons have b   b   size   b
__label__0 the conservation of total baryon number is a more general rule than first noted in nuclear physics  where it was observed that the total number of nucleons was always conserved in nuclear reactions and decays
__label__0 that rule in nuclear physics is just one consequence of the conservation of the total baryon number
__label__0 whimsical names are common in particle physics  reflecting the personalities of modern physicists
__label__0 originally  three quark types  or flavors  were proposed to account for the then  known mesons and baryons
__label__0 these quark flavors are named up  u   down  d   and strange  s
__label__0 color is consistent with all observations and is now widely accepted
__label__1 quark theory including color is called quantum chromodynamics  qcd   also named by gell  mann
__label__1 adipose tissue is a connective tissue found throughout the body
__label__0 it produces the hormone leptin in response to food intake
__label__0 leptin increases the activity of anorexigenic neurons and decreases that of orexigenic neurons  producing a feeling of satiety after eating  thus affecting appetite and reducing the urge for further eating
__label__0 the fatty acids are released into the bloodstream for other tissues to use for atp production
__label__0 the glucocorticoids primarily affect glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose synthesis
__label__0 glucocorticoids also have anti  inflammatory properties through inhibition of the immune system
__label__1 our ability to perceive spatial relationships in three  dimensional  d  space is known as depth perception
__label__0 with depth perception  we can describe things as being in front  behind  above  below  or to the side of other things
__label__1 some people are born deaf  which is known as congenital deafness
__label__0 many others begin to suffer from conductive hearing loss because of age  genetic predisposition  or environmental effects  including exposure to extreme noise  noise  induced hearing loss  as shown in  link    certain illnesses  such as measles or mumps   or damage due to toxins  such as those found in certain solvents and metals
__label__0 molecules from the food and beverages we consume dissolve in our saliva and interact with taste receptors on our tongue and in our mouth and throat
__label__1 taste buds are formed by groupings of taste receptor cells with hair  like extensions that protrude into the central pore of the taste bud   link
__label__0 taste buds have a life cycle of ten days to two weeks  so even destroying some by burning your tongue wo nt have any long  term effect  they just grow right back
__label__1 robert sternberg developed another theory of intelligence  which he titled the triarchic theory of intelligence because it sees intelligence as comprised of three parts  sternberg     practical  creative  and analytical intelligence   link
__label__0 in these cultures  the importance of the group supersedes the importance of individual achievement
__label__1 when you visit such a culture  how well you relate to the values of that culture exemplifies your cultural intelligence  sometimes referred to as cultural competence
__label__1 conservation of energy  as physicists like to call the principle that energy can neither be created nor destroyed  is based on experiment
__label__0 even as scientists discovered new forms of energy  conservation of energy has always been found to apply
__label__1 an important characteristic is that the work done by a nonconservative force adds or removes mechanical energy from a system
__label__0 friction  for example  creates thermal energy that dissipates  removing energy from the system
__label__0 furthermore  even if the thermal energy is retained or captured  it can not be fully converted back to work  so it is lost or not recoverable in that sense as well  the amount of the happy face erased depends on the path taken by the eraser between points a and b  as does the work done against friction
__label__0 if private schools were the only educational institutions  most poor and working  class children and many middle  class children would be uneducated
__label__0 private schooling is a type of good called a toll good
__label__1 toll goods are available to many people  and many people can make use of them  but only if they can pay the price
__label__0 in the united states  for example  congress passes laws regulating banking  and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories  the purity of food offered for sale  and the safety of toys and automobiles
__label__0 in this way  government checks the actions of business  something that it would not do if capitalism in the united states functioned strictly in the manner that adam smith believed it should  almost entirely unregulated

__label__1 americans wished their new government to be a republic  a regime in which the people  not a monarch  held power and elected representatives to govern according to the rule of law
__label__0 many  however  feared that a nation as large as the united states could not be ruled effectively as a republic
__label__0 following the revolution  some of the northern states had either abolished slavery or instituted plans by which slaves would gradually be emancipated
__label__0 pennsylvania  for example  had passed the act for the gradual abolition of slavery in
__label__1 all people born in the state to enslaved mothers after the law s passage would become indentured servants to be set free at age twenty  eight
__label__0 a major problem with the articles of confederation had been the nation s inability to change them without the unanimous consent of all the states
__label__0 the framers learned this lesson well
__label__0 shared and overlapping powers have become an integral part of contemporary us federalism
__label__0 these concurrent powers range from taxing  borrowing  and making and enforcing laws to establishing court systems   link
__label__0 elton e richter
__label__0 lastly  three civil rights amendments  the fifteenth  nineteenth  and twenty  sixth  prevent both the states and the federal government from abridging citizens  right to vote based on race  sex  and age
__label__1 this topic remains controversial because states have not always ensured equal protection  the supremacy clause in article vi of the constitution regulates relationships between the federal and state governments by declaring that the constitution and federal law are the supreme law of the land
__label__0 this means that if a state law clashes with a federal law found to be within the national government s constitutional authority  the federal law prevails
__label__0 during the administrations of presidents richard nixon    and ronald reagan     attempts were made to reverse the process of nationalization  that is  to restore states  prominence in policy areas into which the federal government had moved in the past
__label__0 new federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency  reduces overall public spending  and improves policy outcomes
__label__0 
__label__1 finally  some mandates come in the form of partial preemption regulations  whereby the federal government sets national regulatory standards but delegates the enforcement to state and local governments
__label__1 for example  the clean air act sets air quality regulations but instructs states to design implementation plans to achieve such standards   link
__label__0 martha derthick
__label__0 the number of mandates has continued to rise  and some have been especially costly to states and local authorities
__label__0 consider the real id act of   a federal law designed to beef up homeland security
__label__1 the law requires driver s licenses and state  issued identification cards  dl  ids  to contain standardized anti  fraud security features  specific data  and machine  readable technology
__label__0 the division between mesons and baryons is actually based on their observed decay modes and is not strictly associated with their masses
__label__1 mesons are hadrons that can decay to leptons and leave no hadrons  which implies that mesons are not conserved in number
__label__1 baryons are hadrons that always decay to another baryon
__label__0 what s color got to do with it
__label__0 a whiter shade of pale
__label__0 as mentioned and shown in  link   quarks carry another quantum number  which we call color
__label__0 of course  it is not the color we sense with visible light  but its properties are analogous to those of three primary and three secondary colors
__label__0 after this time  the forces become distinct in almost all interactions  they are no longer unified or symmetric
__label__1 this transition from gut to electroweak is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking  in which conditions spontaneously evolved to a point where the forces were no longer unified  breaking that symmetry
__label__0 this is analogous to a phase transition in the universe  and a clever proposal by american physicist alan guth in the early s ties it to the smoothness of the cmbr
__label__0 it is interesting that several prominent physicists who worked on the concept  including einstein  firmly believed that nature would find a way to prohibit such objects
__label__0 black holes are difficult to observe directly  because they are small and no light comes directly from them
__label__1 in fact  no light comes from inside the event horizon  which is defined to be at a distance from the object at which the escape velocity is exactly the speed of light
__label__0 the radius of the event horizon is known as the schwarzschild radius rs rs size   r rsub  size   s      and is given by

__label__0 approximately  percent of both the senate and the house of representatives are male  and about  percent of members of congress are people of color   link
__label__0 the nation s laws are made primarily by well  educated white male professionals and businessmen
__label__0 this official photograph of the the th congress depicts the fairly uniform nature of congressional representation
__label__0 laws were made by parliament  and property  owning males were allowed to vote for representatives to parliament
__label__0 thus  americans were accustomed to the idea of representative government from the beginning
__label__0 for instance  virginia established its house of burgesses in
__label__0 objections that an elite group of wealthy and educated bankers  businessmen  and large landowners would come to dominate the nation s politics were also addressed by madison in federalist no
__label__0 many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the english bill of rights and the virginia declaration of rights
__label__1 for example  the right to bear arms for protection  second amendment   the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime  third amendment   the right to a trial by jury  sixth and seventh amendments   and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment  eighth amendment  are taken from the english bill of rights
__label__1 the fifth amendment  which requires among other things that people can not be deprived of their life  liberty  or property except by a legal proceeding  was also greatly influenced by english law as well as the protections granted to virginians in the virginia declaration of rights
__label__0 in   the supreme court decided not to hear several key case appeals from a variety of states  all of which were brought by opponents of marriage equality who had lost in the federal courts
__label__0 the outcome of not hearing these cases was that federal court decisions in four states were affirmed  which  when added to other states in the same federal circuit districts  brought the total number of states permitting same  sex marriage to thirty
__label__0 adam liptak   supreme court delivers tacit win to gay marriage   new york times   october
__label__1 then  in   the obergefell v hodges case had a sweeping effect when the supreme court clearly identified a constitutional right to marriage based on the fourteenth amendment  obergefell v hodges   us
__label__0 as george washington s secretary of the treasury from  to   alexander hamilton championed legislative efforts to create a publicly chartered bank
__label__0 for hamilton  the establishment of the bank of the united states was fully within congress s authority  and he hoped the bank would foster economic development  print and circulate paper money  and provide loans to the government
__label__1 medicaid  which provides medical assistance to the indigent   medicare  which provides health insurance to the elderly and disabled   and school nutrition programs were created
__label__0 the elementary and secondary education act     the higher education act     and the head start preschool program    were established to expand educational opportunities and equality   link
__label__0 the clean air act     the highway safety act     and the fair packaging and labeling act    promoted environmental and consumer protection
__label__0 op  ed  in the wake of windsor   june   httpwwwadvocatecomcommentaryopedwakewindsor  june
__label__1 in the final analysis  same  sex marriage is a protected constitutional right as decided by the us supreme court  which took up the issue again when it heard obergefell v hodges in
__label__0 a similar pattern often operates within businesses
__label__1 in many cases  a business that focuses on one or a few products  sometimes called its  core competency   is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products
__label__1 third  specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale  which means that for many goods  as the level of production increases  the average cost of producing each individual unit declines
__label__0 but the decisions of what will be produced and what prices will be charged are heavily regulated
__label__1 heavily regulated economies often have underground economies  which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government s approval
__label__0 whatever the firm s quantity of production  total revenue must exceed total costs if it is to earn a profit
__label__0 as explored in the chapter choice in a world of scarcity  fixed costs are often sunk costs that can not be recouped
__label__0 in thinking about what to do next  sunk costs should typically be ignored  since this spending has already been made and can not be changed
__label__0 many industries experience economies of scale
__label__1 economies of scale refers to the situation where  as the quantity of output goes up  the cost per unit goes down
__label__0 this is the idea behind  warehouse stores  like costco or walmart
__label__0 but even stretching the truth can be costly for a publisher
__label__0 in   star magazine published a headline   addiction nightmare  katie drug shocker   leading readers to believe actress katie holmes was taking drugs
__label__0 while the article in the magazine focuses on the addictive quality of scientology sessions rather than drugs  the implication and the headline were different
__label__0 in his  presidential run  barack obama promised to run a transparent white house
__label__0 christopher beam   the tmi president   slate   november
__label__0 yet once in office  he found that transparency makes it difficult to get work done  and so he limited access and questions
__label__0 in his first year in office  george w bush  who was criticized by obama as having a closed government  gave  question  and  answer sessions with journalists  while obama gave only
__label__0 then  legislative seats are doled out to the parties based on the proportion of support each party receives
__label__0 while the green party in the united states might not win a single congressional seat in some years thanks to plurality voting  in a proportional system  it stands a chance to get a few seats in the legislature regardless
__label__0 for example  assume the green party gets  percent of the vote
__label__0 by fostering a sense of loyalty  a party can insulate itself from changes in the system and improve its odds of winning elections
__label__1 the party  in  the  electorate are those members of the voting public who consider themselves to be part of a political party andor who consistently prefer the candidates of one party over the other
__label__0 however  in its one  person  one  vote decision in reynolds v simms     the supreme court argued that everyone s vote should count roughly the same regardless of where they lived  reynolds v simms   us
__label__0 districts had to be adjusted so they would have roughly equal populations
__label__0 several states therefore had to make dramatic changes to their electoral maps during the next two redistricting cycles     and
__label__0 lobbyists representing a variety of organizations employ different techniques to achieve their objectives
__label__1 one method is inside lobbying or direct lobbying  which takes the interest group s message directly to a government official such as a lawmaker
__label__0 nownes and newmark   interest groups in the states
__label__0 inside lobbying tactics include testifying in legislative hearings and helping to draft legislation
__label__0 numerous surveys of lobbyists have confirmed that the vast majority rely on these inside strategies
__label__0 aarp  for example  offers discounts on hotel accommodations and insurance rates for its members  while dues are very low  so they can actually save money by joining
__label__1 group leaders may also offer solidary incentives  which provide the benefit of joining with others who have the same concerns or are similar in other ways
__label__0 some scholars suggest that people are naturally drawn to others with similar concerns
__label__1 these rules are special cases of the laws of conservation of charge and conservation of energy
__label__0 the rules are known as kirchhoff s rules  after their inventor gustav kirchhoff
__label__0 this circuit can not be reduced to a combination of series and parallel connections
__label__0 kirchhoff s rules  special applications of the laws of conservation of charge and energy  can be used to analyze it
__label__1 analog meters have a needle that swivels to point at numbers on a scale  as opposed to digital meters  which have numerical readouts similar to a hand  held calculator
__label__1 the heart of most analog meters is a device called a galvanometer  denoted by g current flow through a galvanometer  ig ig size   i rsub  size   g       produces a proportional needle deflection
__label__0 since magnetic forces act at a distance  we define a magnetic field to represent magnetic forces
__label__0 the pictorial representation of magnetic field lines is very useful in visualizing the strength and direction of the magnetic field
__label__1 as shown in  link   the direction of magnetic field lines is defined to be the direction in which the north end of a compass needle points
__label__0 objectives arranged in this way are described as parfocal
__label__1 the second  the eyepiece  also referred to as the ocular  has several lenses which slide inside a cylindrical barrel
__label__0 the focusing ability is provided by the movement of both the objective lens and the eyepiece
__label__1 bilateral symmetry involves the division of the animal through a sagittal plane  resulting in two mirror image  right and left halves  such as those of a butterfly   linkd   crab  or human body
__label__1 animals with bilateral symmetry have a  head  and  tail   anterior vs posterior   front and back  dorsal vs ventral   and right and left sides   link
__label__0 her immediate successors returned to the less visible role held by her predecessors  although in the early s  jacqueline kennedy gained attention for her efforts to refurbish the white house along historical lines  and lady bird johnson in the mid and late s endorsed an effort to beautify public spaces and highways in the united states
__label__0 she also established the foundations of what came to be known as the office of the first lady  complete with a news reporter  liz carpenter  as her press secretary
__label__1 starting in new york in   the early supreme court focused on establishing its rules and procedures and perhaps trying to carve its place as the new government s third branch
__label__0 however  given the difficulty of getting all the justices even to show up  and with no permanent home or building of its own for decades  finding its footing in the early days proved to be a monumental task
__label__0 people who opposed the law and understood that a congressional repeal would not happen any time soon looked to the courts for help
__label__0 they challenged the constitutionality of the law in national federation of independent business v sebelius  hoping the supreme court would overturn it  national federation of independent business v sebelius   us
__label__1 the practice of judicial review enabled the law s critics to exercise this opportunity  even though their hopes were ultimately dashed when  by a narrow    margin  the supreme court upheld the health care law as a constitutional extension of congress s power to tax
__label__0 south carolina governor nikki haley delivers her  state of the state address from the state house in columbia  south carolina  on january
__label__0 for instance  most states provide governors the power of the line  item veto
__label__0 the line  item veto gives governors the ability to strike out a line or individual portions of a bill while letting the remainder pass into law
__label__0 in addition  approximately  percent of governors have the power of an amendatory veto  which allows them to send a bill back to the legislature and request a specific amendment to it
__label__1 under a council  elected executive system  the voters elect both the members of the council and the executive
__label__0 the executive performs functions similar to those of the state governor
__label__0 a number of laws passed in the decades between the end of the second world war and the late s have created a framework through which citizens can exercise their own bureaucratic oversight
__label__0 the two most important laws are the freedom of information act of  and the government in sunshine act of   httpswwwlawcornelledu  uscode  text  httpswwwgpogovfdsyspkgstatutepdfstatutepgpdf  june
__label__0 like many of the modern bureaucratic reforms in the united states  both emerged during a period of heightened skepticism about government activities
__label__0 they turn instead to the vast government bureaucracy to provide policy guidance
__label__1 for example  when congress passed the clean water act     it dictated that steps should be taken to improve water quality throughout the country
__label__0 but it ultimately left it to the bureaucracy to figure out exactly how  clean  water needed to be
__label__0 for example  your home or apartment is a private good reserved for your own use because you pay rent or make mortgage payments for the privilege of living there
__label__0 further  private goods are finite and can run out if overused  even if only in the short term
__label__0 the fact that private goods are excludable and finite makes them tradable
__label__0 in societies operating in survival mode  in contrast  people tend to focus more on short  term problem  solving than on long  term planning
__label__0 second  social welfare policy creates an automatic stimulus for a society by building a safety net that can catch members of society who are suffering economic hardship through no fault of their own
__label__0 for an individual family  this safety net makes the difference between eating and starving  for an entire economy  it could prevent an economic recession from sliding into a broader and more damaging depression
__label__0 what is foreign policy
__label__1 we can think of it on several levels  as  the goals that a state s officials seek to attain abroad  the values that give rise to those objectives  and the means or instruments used to pursue them
__label__0 eugene r wittkopf  christopher m jones  and charles w kegley  jr
__label__0 it includes everything produced by a society  including all of the social rules
__label__1 sociologists often study culture using the sociological imagination  which pioneer sociologist c wright mills described as an awareness of the relationship between a person s behavior and experience and the wider culture that shaped the person s choices and perceptions
__label__0 it s a way of seeing our own and other people s behavior in relationship to history and social structure
__label__1 while pastoral and horticultural societies used small  temporary tools such as digging sticks or hoes  agricultural societies relied on permanent tools for survival
__label__1 around  bce  an explosion of new technology known as the agricultural revolution made farming possible  and profitable
__label__0 one person can be associated with a multitude of roles and statuses
__label__0 even a single status such as  student  has a complex role  set  or array of roles  attached to it  merton
__label__0 if too much is required of a single role  individuals can experience role strain
__label__0 half these people were children
__label__1 a refugee is defined as an individual who has been forced to leave his or her country in order to escape war  persecution  or natural disaster  while asylum  seekers are those whose claim to refugee status has not been validated
__label__0 an internally displaced person  on the other hand  is neither a refugee nor an asylum  seeker
__label__0 functional perspectives on urbanization generally focus on the ecology of the city  while conflict perspective tends to focus on political economy
__label__1 human ecology is a functionalist field of study that looks at on the relationship between people and their built and natural physical environments  park
__label__0 generally speaking  urban land use and urban population distribution occur in a predictable pattern once we understand how people relate to their living environment
__label__1 a mass is a relatively large number of people with a common interest  though they may not be in close proximity  lofland    such as players of the popular facebook game farmville
__label__1 a public  on the other hand  is an unorganized  relatively diffused group of people who share ideas  such as the libertarian political party
__label__0 while these two types of crowds are similar  they are not the same
__label__0 he held that once scholars identified the laws that governed society  sociologists could address problems such as poor education and poverty  abercrombie et al
__label__0 comte named the scientific study of social patterns positivism
__label__0 he described his philosophy in a series of books called the course in positive philosophy    and a general view of positivism
__label__0 as the gilded age unfolded  presidents had very little power  due in large part to highly contested elections in which relative popular majorities were razor  thin
__label__0 two presidents won the electoral college without a popular majority
__label__0 the subsequent discovery of gold in california in  further spurred interest in connecting the atlantic and pacific oceans  and led to the construction of the panama railway  which began operations in
__label__0 several attempts by france to construct a canal between  and  failed due to a combination of financial crises and health hazards  including malaria and yellow fever  which led to the deaths of thousands of french workers
__label__0 while these laws touched on important aspects of the great society  the centerpiece of johnson s plan was the eradication of poverty in the united states
__label__0 the war on poverty  as he termed it  was fought on many fronts
__label__1 the  housing and urban development act offered grants to improve city housing and subsidized rents for the poor
__label__1 expressive crowds are people who join together to express emotion  often at funerals  weddings  or the like
__label__1 the final type  acting crowds  focuses on a specific goal or action  such as a protest movement or riot  in addition to the different types of crowds  collective groups can also be identified in two other ways
__label__1 a mass is a relatively large number of people with a common interest  though they may not be in close proximity  lofland    such as players of the popular facebook game farmville
__label__1 urbanization is the study of the social  political  and economic relationships in cities  and someone specializing in urban sociology studies those relationships
__label__0 in some ways  cities can be microcosms of universal human behavior  while in others they provide a unique environment that yields its own brand of human behavior
__label__0 thomas malthus      was an english clergyman who made dire predictions about earth s ability to sustain its growing population
__label__0 according to malthusian theory  three factors would control human population that exceeded the earth s carrying capacity  or how many people can live in a given area considering the amount of available resources
__label__0 malthus identified these factors as war  famine  and disease  malthus
__label__0 societies develop along a predictable continuum as they evolve from unindustrialized to postindustrial
__label__1 demographic transition theory  caldwell and caldwell   suggests that future population growth will develop along a predictable four  stage model
__label__0 in stage   birth  death  and infant mortality rates are all high  while life expectancy is short
__label__0 an example of this stage is the s in the united states
__label__0 we can imagine that an army general or a fortune  ceo would be an instrumental leader
__label__1 in contrast  expressive leaders are more concerned with promoting emotional strength and health  and ensuring that people feel supported
__label__0 social and religious leaders  rabbis  priests  imams  directors of youth homes and social service programs  are often perceived as expressive leaders
__label__0 a complaint of modern life is that society is dominated by large and impersonal secondary organizations
__label__0 from schools to businesses to healthcare to government  these organizations  referred to as formal organizations  are highly bureaucratized
__label__0 indeed  all formal organizations are  or likely will become  bureaucracies
__label__0 people with these disorders display a personality style that is odd or eccentric
__label__1 cluster b disorders include antisocial personality disorder  histrionic personality disorder  narcissistic personality disorder  and borderline personality disorder
__label__0 people with these disorders usually are impulsive  overly dramatic  highly emotional  and erratic
__label__1 according to the dsm  the individual with antisocial personality disorder  sometimes referred to as psychopathy  shows no regard at all for other people s rights or feelings
__label__0 this lack of regard is exhibited a number of ways and can include repeatedly performing illegal acts  lying to or conning others  impulsivity and recklessness  irritability and aggressiveness toward others  and failure to act in a responsible way  eg  leaving debts unpaid   apa
__label__1 a variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment
__label__1 the control group contains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that is hypothesized about
__label__0 therefore  if the results of the experimental group differ from the control group  the difference must be due to the hypothesized manipulation  rather than some outside factor
__label__0 to return to the example of excess hydrogen ions in the blood  the formation of carbonic acid will be the major direction of the reaction
__label__0 however  the carbonic acid can also leave the body as carbon dioxide gas  via exhalation  instead of being converted back to bicarbonate ion  thus driving the reaction to the right by the chemical law known as law of mass action
__label__0 these reactions are important for maintaining the homeostasis of our blood
__label__1 this movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as electron transfer
__label__0 as  link  illustrates  sodium  na  only has one electron in its outer electron shell
__label__1 in doing so  monomers release water molecules as byproducts
__label__0 this type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis  which means  to put together while losing water
__label__0 in monocots  petals usually number three or multiples of three  in dicots  the number of petals is four or five  or multiples of four and five
__label__1 together  the calyx and corolla are known as the perianth
__label__1 the third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium
__label__0 in monocot seeds   link    the testa and tegmen of the seed coat are fused
__label__1 as the seed germinates  the primary root emerges  protected by the root  tip covering  the coleorhiza
__label__1 next  the primary shoot emerges  protected by the coleoptile  the covering of the shoot tip
__label__1 torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions
__label__0 torpor can be used by animals for long periods  such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months  in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature
__label__0 during hibernation  ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of   c    f   while a bear s internal temperature is maintained higher at about   c    f
__label__1 if torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water  it is called estivation
__label__0 comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues  economic inequality and poverty
__label__1 poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income  called the poverty line  that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living
__label__1 income inequality compares the share of the total income  or wealth  in society that is received by different groups  for example  comparing the share of income received by the top   to the share of income received by the bottom
__label__1 the earned income tax credit  eitc   first passed in   is a method of assisting the working poor through the tax system
__label__0 the eitc is one of the largest assistance program for low  income groups  and projections for  expected  million households to take advantage of it at an estimated cost of   billion
__label__1 insurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental financial effect
__label__1 generally  households or firms with insurance make regular payments  called premiums
__label__0 the insurance company prices these premiums based on the probability of certain events occurring among a pool of people
__label__0 another source of financial capital is a bond
__label__1 a bond is a financial contract  a borrower agrees to repay the amount that was borrowed and also a rate of interest over a period of time in the future
__label__0 a corporate bond is issued by firms  but bonds are also issued by various levels of government
__label__0 the mechanisms for saving available to households can be divided into several categories  deposits in bank accounts  bonds  stocks  money market mutual funds  stock and bond mutual funds  and housing and other tangible assets like owning gold
__label__0 each of these investments needs to be analyzed in terms of three factors     the expected rate of return it will pay     the risk that the return will be much lower or higher than expected  and    the liquidity of the investment  which refers to how easily money or financial assets can be exchanged for a good or service
__label__0 we will do this analysis as we discuss each of these investments in the sections below
__label__1 the actual step that converts light energy into chemical energy takes place in a multiprotein complex called a photosystem  two types of which are found embedded in the thylakoid membrane  photosystem ii  psii  and photosystem i  psi    link
__label__0 the two complexes differ on the basis of what they oxidize  that is  the source of the low  energy electron supply  and what they reduce  the place to which they deliver their energized electrons
__label__0 the ear can be separated into multiple sections
__label__1 the outer ear includes the pinna  which is the visible part of the ear that protrudes from our heads  the auditory canal  and the tympanic membrane  or eardrum
__label__1 the middle ear contains three tiny bones known as the ossicles  which are named the malleus  or hammer   incus  or anvil   and the stapes  or stirrup
__label__1 as the ossicles move  the stapes presses into a thin membrane of the cochlea known as the oval window
__label__1 as the stapes presses into the oval window  the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move  which in turn stimulates hair cells  which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane
__label__1 the basilar membrane is a thin strip of tissue within the cochlea
__label__0 when pavlov paired the tone with the meat powder over and over again  the previously neutral stimulus  the tone  also began to elicit salivation from the dogs
__label__1 thus  the neutral stimulus became the conditioned stimulus  cs   which is a stimulus that elicits a response after repeatedly being paired with an unconditioned stimulus
__label__0 eventually  the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone  just as they previously had salivated at the sound of the assistants  footsteps
__label__0 as mentioned earlier  the hippocampus is also involved in emotional processing
__label__0 like the amygdala  research has demonstrated that hippocampal structure and function are linked to a variety of mood and anxiety disorders
__label__0 there are three types of encoding
__label__1 the encoding of words and their meaning is known as semantic encoding
__label__0 it was first demonstrated by william bousfield    in an experiment in which he asked people to memorize words
__label__1 in the atkinson  shiffrin model  stimuli from the environment are processed first in sensory memory  storage of brief sensory events  such as sights  sounds  and tastes
__label__1 in the atkinson  shiffrin model  stimuli from the environment are processed first in sensory memory  storage of brief sensory events  such as sights  sounds  and acquisition
__label__0 it is very brief storage  up to a couple of seconds
__label__1 then  information in short  term memory goes to long  term memory  you save it to your hard drive   or it is discarded  you delete a document or close a web browser
__label__1 this step of rehearsal  the conscious repetition of information to be remembered  to move stm into long  term memory is called memory consolidation
__label__0 lashley did not find evidence of the engram  and the rats were still able to find their way through the maze  regardless of the size or location of the lesion
__label__1 based on his creation of lesions and the animals  reaction  he formulated the equipotentiality hypothesis  if part of one area of the brain involved in memory is damaged  another part of the same area can take over that memory function  lashley
__label__0 although lashley s early work did not confirm the existence of the engram  modern psychologists are making progress locating it
__label__1 a flashbulb memory is an exceptionally clear recollection of an important event   link
__label__0 where were you when you first heard about the  terrorist attacks
__label__0 he disagreed  however  with skinner s strict behaviorist approach to personality development  because he felt that thinking and reasoning are important components of learning
__label__0 he presented a social  cognitive theory of personality that emphasizes both learning and cognition as sources of individual differences in personality
__label__1 in social  cognitive theory  the concepts of reciprocal determinism  observational learning  and self  efficacy all play a part in personality development
__label__1 weight  also called force of gravity  is a pervasive force that acts at all times and must be counteracted to keep an object from falling
__label__0 you definitely notice that you must support the weight of a heavy object by pushing up on it when you hold it stationary  as illustrated in  link   a
__label__0 it may be a number on a digital clock  a heartbeat  or the position of the sun in the sky
__label__1 in physics  the definition of time is simple  time is change  or the interval over which change occurs
__label__0 it is impossible to know that time has passed unless something changes
__label__1 the property of a body to remain at rest or to remain in motion with constant velocity is called inertia
__label__0 newton s first law is often called the law of inertia
__label__0 as we know from experience  some objects have more inertia than others
__label__0 link  shows the displacement of a harmonic oscillator for different amounts of damping
__label__1 when we want to damp out oscillations  such as in the suspension of a car  we may want the system to return to equilibrium as quickly as possible critical damping is defined as the condition in which the damping of an oscillator results in it returning as quickly as possible to its equilibrium position the critically damped system may overshoot the equilibrium position  but if it does  it will do so only once
__label__0 critical damping is represented by curve a in  link
__label__0 pollen grains can travel far from their original sporophyte  spreading the plant s genes
__label__0 the seed offers the embryo protection  nourishment  and a mechanism to maintain dormancy for tens or even thousands of years  ensuring germination can occur when growth conditions are optimal
__label__0 seeds therefore allow plants to disperse the next generation through both space and time
__label__1 flowers and fruits as an evolutionary adaptationangiosperms produce their gametes in separate organs  which are usually housed in a flower
__label__0 both fertilization and embryo development take place inside an anatomical structure that provides a stable system of sexual reproduction largely sheltered from environmental fluctuations
__label__1 this leads to the formation of the next developmental stage  the gastrula  in which the future digestive cavity is formed
__label__1 different cell layers  called germ layers  are formed during gastrulation
__label__0 these germ layers are programmed to develop into certain tissue types  organs  and organ systems during a process called organogenesis
__label__0 only a few animal groups display radial symmetry
__label__1 all types of symmetry are well suited to meet the unique demands of a particular animal s lifestyle  radial symmetry is the arrangement of body parts around a central axis  as is seen in a drinking glass or pie
__label__0 it results in animals having top and bottom surfaces but no left and right sides  or front or back
__label__0 examples of acoelomates include animals in the phylum platyhelminthes  also known as flatworms
__label__1 animals with a true coelom are called eucoelomates  or coelomates    link
__label__1 a true coelom arises entirely within the mesoderm germ layer and is lined by an epithelial membrane
__label__1 the coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process called schizocoely  meaning that during development  a solid mass of the mesoderm splits apart and forms the hollow opening of the coelom
__label__0 deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process called enterocoely
__label__1 here  the mesoderm develops as pouches that are pinched off from the endoderm tissue
__label__0 there is a second distinction between the types of cleavage in protostomes and deuterostomes
__label__0 in addition to spiral cleavage  protostomes also undergo determinate cleavage
__label__1 this means that even at this early stage  the developmental fate of each embryonic cell is already determined
__label__1 the invertebrates  or invertebrata  are animals that do not contain bony structures  such as the cranium and vertebrae
__label__0 the simplest of all the invertebrates are the parazoans  which include only the phylum porifera  the sponges   link
__label__0 notice that each name is capitalized except for species  and the genus and species names are italicized
__label__1 scientists generally refer to an organism only by its genus and species  which is its two  word scientific name  in what is called binomial nomenclature
__label__0 therefore  the scientific name of the dog is canis lupus
__label__1 positive polarity means that the genomic rna can serve directly as mrna
__label__1 intermediates of dsrna  called replicative intermediates  are made in the process of copying the genomic rna
__label__1 multiple  full  length rna strands of negative polarity  complimentary to the positive  stranded genomic rna  are formed from these intermediates  which may then serve as templates for the production of rna with positive polarity  including both full  length genomic rna and shorter viral mrnas
__label__1 the main symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations  delusions  disorganized thinking  disorganized or abnormal motor behavior  and negative symptoms  apa
__label__1 a hallucination is a perceptual experience that occurs in the absence of external stimulation
__label__1 auditory hallucinations  hearing voices  occur in roughly two  thirds of patients with schizophrenia and are by far the most common form of hallucination  andreasen
__label__0 in addition to the factors discussed above that can help overcome collective action problems  external events can sometimes help mobilize groups and potential members
__label__0 some scholars argue that disturbance theory can explain why groups mobilize due to an event in the political  economic  or social environment  david truman
__label__1 social psychology examines how people affect one another  and it looks at the power of the situation
__label__1 social psychologists assert that an individual s thoughts  feelings  and behaviors are very much influenced by social situations
__label__1 in individual therapy  also known as individual psychotherapy or individual counseling  the client and clinician meet one  on  one  usually from  minutes to  hour
__label__0 these meetings typically occur weekly or every other week  and sessions are conducted in a confidential and caring environment   link
__label__1 when someone has two copies of the same allele  they are said to be homozygous for that allele
__label__1 when someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene  they are said to be heterozygous
__label__0 for example  smooth chin is a recessive trait  which means that an individual will only display the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele  bbimagine that a woman with a cleft chin mates with a man with a smooth chin
__label__0 much of what psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in psychological disorders
__label__0 psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiological causes of behavior assert that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated with imbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems
__label__0 in this perspective  psychotropic medications can help improve the symptoms associated with these disorders
__label__0 high  income countries of the world  primarily the united states  canada  countries of the european union  and japan  subsidize their domestic farmers collectively by about   billion per year
__label__0 by contrast  the total amount of foreign aid from these same high  income countries to the poor countries of the world is about   billion per year  or less than   of the farm subsidies
__label__0 also like the romans  the inca were effective administrators
__label__1 runners called chasquis traversed the roads in a continuous relay system  ensuring quick communication over long distances
__label__0 the inca had no system of writing  however
__label__0 the portuguese traded or sold slaves to spanish  dutch  and english colonists in the americas  particularly in south america and the caribbean  where sugar was a primary export
__label__0 thousands of african slaves found themselves growing  harvesting  and processing sugarcane in an arduous routine of physical labor
__label__0 slaves had to cut the long cane stalks by hand and then bring them to a mill  where the cane juice was extracted
__label__0 to add further explanation to article iii  alexander hamilton wrote details about the federal judiciary in federalist no
__label__0 these powers stem from the elastic clause in article i  section   of the constitution  which provides congress the authority  to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers
__label__0 this statement has been used to support the federal government s playing a role in controversial policy matters  such as the provision of healthcare  the expansion of power to levy and collect taxes  and regulation of interstate commerce
__label__1 finally  article vi declared that the us constitution and any laws or treaties made in connection with that document were to supersede constitutions and laws made at the state level
__label__1 finally  article vi declared that the us constitution and any laws or treaties made in connection with that document were to supersede constitutions and laws made at the state level
__label__0 this clause  better known as the supremacy clause  makes clear that any conflict in law between the central  or federal  government and the regional  or state  governments is typically resolved in favor of the central government
__label__0 although the us constitution clearly allocated more power to the federal government than had been the case under the articles of confederation  the framers still respected the important role of the states in the new government
__label__0 theorists have long proposed that states are also unique as a function of their differing political cultures  or their attitudes and beliefs about the functions and expectations of the government
__label__0 in the book  american federalism  a view from the states  daniel elazar first theorized in  that the united states could be divided into three distinct political cultures  moralistic  individualistic  and traditionalistic   link
__label__0 the diffusion of these cultures throughout the united states is attributed to the migratory patterns of immigrants who settled in and spread out across the country from the east to the west coast
__label__0 new york  atherton press
__label__1 a delegate legislator represents the will of those who elected him or her to office and acts in their expressed interest  even when it goes against personal belief about what is ultimately in the constituency s best interest
__label__1 on the other hand  trustees believe they were elected to exercise their own judgment and know best because they have the time and expertise to study and understand an issue
__label__0 thus  a trustee will be willing to vote against the desire of the constituency so long as he or she believes it is in the people s best interest
__label__0 for example  article ii  section   provides the president the power to appoint officers and department heads
__label__0 in the following section  the president is further empowered to see that the laws are  faithfully executed
__label__0 more specifically  article i  section   empowers congress to establish a post office  build roads  regulate commerce  coin money  and regulate the value of money
__label__0 mendel followed alleles as they were inherited from parent to offspring
__label__0 in the early twentieth century  biologists in a field of study known as population genetics began to study how selective forces change a population through changes in allele and genotypic frequencies
__label__0 it is hard to determine which process dominates because it is often nearly impossible to determine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each occurrence
__label__1 an event that initiates an allele frequency change in an isolated part of the population  which is not typical of the original population  is called the founder effect
__label__0 natural selection  random drift  and founder effects can lead to significant changes in the genome of a population
__label__0 for example  in  link   all of the organisms in the orange region evolved from a single ancestor that had amniotic eggs
__label__0 consequently  all of these organisms also have amniotic eggs and make a single clade  also called a monophyletic group
__label__0 clades must include all of the descendants from a branch point
__label__1 evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of earth s existence  the atmosphere was anoxic  meaning that there was no molecular oxygen
__label__1 therefore  only those organisms that can grow without oxygen  anaerobic organisms  were able to live
__label__0 seedless plants have historically played a role in human life through uses as tools  fuel  and medicine
__label__0 dried peat moss  sphagnum  is commonly used as fuel in some parts of europe and is considered a renewable resource
__label__0 sphagnum bogs   link   are cultivated with cranberry and blueberry bushes
__label__0 consider  for example  a child s physical growth  adding inches to her height year by year
__label__0 in contrast  theorists who view development as discontinuous believe that development takes place in unique stages  it occurs at specific times or ages
__label__0 with this type of development  the change is more sudden  such as an infant s ability to conceive object permanence
__label__0 jean piaget    is another stage theorist who studied childhood development   link
__label__0 instead of approaching development from a psychoanalytical or psychosocial perspective  piaget focused on children s cognitive growth
__label__0 how did you come to be who you are
__label__0 from beginning as a one  cell structure to your birth  your prenatal development occurred in an orderly and delicate sequence
__label__0 an especially popular model that describes the dynamics of persuasion is the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion  petty  cacioppo
__label__1 the elaboration likelihood model considers the variables of the attitude change approach  that is  features of the source of the persuasive message  contents of the message  and characteristics of the audience are used to determine when attitude change will occur
__label__0 according to the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion  there are two main routes that play a role in delivering a persuasive message  central and peripheral   link
__label__1 in normative social influence  people conform to the group norm to fit in  to feel good  and to be accepted by the group
__label__1 however  with informational social influence  people conform because they believe the group is competent and has the correct information  particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous
__label__0 people often form judgments and hold expectations about people based on their age
__label__1 these judgments and expectations can lead to ageism  or prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based solely on their age
__label__0 typically  ageism occurs against older adults  but ageism also can occur toward younger adults
__label__1 both photosystems have the same basic structure  a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place
__label__0 each photosystem is serviced by the light  harvesting complex  which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center  it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of    chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids
__label__0 the absorption of a single photon or distinct quantity or  packet  of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state
__label__0 mistakes in the duplication or distribution of the chromosomes lead to mutations that may be passed forward to every new cell produced from an abnormal cell
__label__0 to prevent a compromised cell from continuing to divide  there are internal control mechanisms that operate at three main cell cycle checkpoints
__label__1 a checkpoint is one of several points in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which the progression of a cell to the next stage in the cycle can be halted until conditions are favorable
__label__0 however  because there are two rounds of division  the major process and the stages are designated with a  i  or a  ii
__label__1 thus  meiosis i is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase i  prometaphase i  and so on
__label__1 meiosis ii  in which the second round of meiotic division takes place  includes prophase ii  prometaphase ii  and so on
__label__0 during this period  the supreme court s decisions regarding the meaning of the second amendment were ambiguous at best
__label__1 in united states v miller  the supreme court upheld the  national firearms act s prohibition of sawed  off shotguns  largely on the basis that possession of such a gun was not related to the goal of promoting a  well regulated militia
__label__0 united states v miller   us
__label__0 this finding was generally interpreted as meaning that the second amendment protected the right of the states to organize a militia  rather than an individual right  and thus lower courts generally found most firearm regulations  including some city and state laws that virtually outlawed the private ownership of firearms  to be constitutional
__label__0 the reexamination of past cases through dna evidence has revealed dozens in which people were wrongfully executed
__label__0 elizabeth lopatto   how many innocent people are sentenced to death    forbes   april   httpwwwforbescomsiteselizabethlopattohowmanyinnocentpeoplearesentencedtodeatheaecc  march
__label__0 for example  claude jones was executed for murder based on era dna testing of a single hair that was determined at that time to be his  however  with better dna testing technology  it was later found to be that of the victim  dave mann   dna tests undermine evidence in texas execution  new results show claude jones was put to death on flawed evidence   texas observer   november   httpwwwtexasobserverorgtexasobserverexclusivednatestsundermineevidenceintexasexecution  march
__label__0 perhaps as a result of this and other cases  seven additional states have abolished capital punishment since
__label__0 as of   nineteen states and the district of columbia no longer apply the death penalty in new cases  and several other states do not carry out executions despite sentencing people to death  see  for example   states with and without the death penalty   death penalty information center  httpwwwdeathpenaltyinfoorgstatesandwithoutdeathpenalty  march
__label__0 it remains to be seen whether this gradual trend toward the elimination of the death penalty by the states will continue  or whether the supreme court will eventually decide to follow former justice harry blackmun s decision to  no longer  tinker with the machinery of death  and abolish it completely
__label__0 in the modern era  laws and actions that are challenged under strict scrutiny have rarely been upheld
__label__0 strict scrutiny  however  was the legal basis for the supreme court s  upholding of the legality of the internment of japanese americans during world war ii  discussed later in this chapter  korematsu v united states   us
__label__0 finally  affirmative action consists of government programs and policies designed to benefit members of groups historically subject to discrimination
__label__0 much of the controversy surrounding affirmative action is about whether strict scrutiny should be applied to these cases
__label__0 although these methods were usually sufficient to ensure that blacks were kept away from the polls  some dedicated african americans did manage to register to vote despite the obstacles placed in their way
__label__1 to ensure their vote was largely meaningless  the white elites used their control of the democratic party to create the white primary  primary elections in which only whites were allowed to vote
__label__0 the state party organizations argued that as private groups  rather than part of the state government  they had no obligation to follow the fifteenth amendment s requirement not to deny the right to vote on the basis of race
__label__1 in   congress proposed what later became the twenty  fourth amendment  which banned the poll tax in elections to federal  but not state or local  office  the amendment went into effect after being ratified in early
__label__1 several southern states continued to require residents to pay poll taxes in order to vote in state elections until  when  in the case of harper v virginia board of elections  the supreme court declared that requiring payment of a poll tax in order to vote in an election at any level was unconstitutional  harper v virginia board of elections   us
__label__0 
__label__0 stanton and anthony denounced the fifteenth amendment because it granted voting rights only to black men and not to women of any race  keyssar
__label__0 the fight for women s rights did not die  however
__label__1 in   stanton and anthony formed the national woman suffrage association  nwsa   which demanded that the constitution be amended to grant the right to vote to all women
__label__0 it also called for more lenient divorce laws and an end to sex discrimination in employment
__label__0 the result
__label__0 alf landon was predicted to win  percent of the popular vote  in the end  he received only  percent  arthur evans   predict landon electoral vote to be  to    chicago tribune   october
__label__0 franklin d roosevelt won another term  but the story demonstrates the need to be scientific in conducting polls

__label__1 earthworms  annelids  have slightly more evolved excretory structures called nephridia  illustrated in  link  b
__label__0 a pair of nephridia is present on each segment of the earthworm
__label__0 birds  reptiles  and most terrestrial arthropods convert toxic ammonia to uric acid or the closely related compound guanine  guano  instead of urea
__label__0 mammals also form some uric acid during breakdown of nucleic acids
__label__1 the environment consists of numerous pathogens  which are agents  usually microorganisms  that cause diseases in their hosts
__label__1 a host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen
__label__1 pathogens include bacteria  protists  fungi and other infectious organisms
__label__0 the immune system has specific cells  described in  link  and shown in  link   with receptors that recognize these pamps
__label__1 a macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens
__label__0 macrophages recognize pamps via complementary pattern recognition receptors  prrs
__label__1 a mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules  such as histamine  in response to large pathogens
__label__1 a basophil is a leukocyte that  like a neutrophil  releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in  link
__label__0 basophils are also involved in allergy and hypersensitivity responses and induce specific types of inflammatory responses
__label__0 during sexual reproduction the genetic material of two individuals is combined to produce genetically diverse offspring that differ from their parents
__label__0 the genetic diversity of sexually produced offspring is thought to give species a better chance of surviving in an unpredictable or changing environment
__label__0 in the male reproductive system  the scrotum houses the testicles or testes  singular  testis   including providing passage for blood vessels  nerves  and muscles related to testicular function
__label__1 in the male reproductive system  the scrotum houses the testicles or testes  singular  testis   including providing passage for blood vessels  nerves  and muscles related to testicular function
__label__1 the testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones
__label__0 it becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific method plays a major role in science
__label__1 the scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation
__label__0 the forest itself is an ecosystem
__label__1 an ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic  non  living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water
__label__1 at the highest level of organization   link    the biosphere is the collection of all ecosystems  and it represents the zones of life on earth
__label__1 glycogen is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates and is made up of monomers of glucose
__label__0 glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and muscle cells
__label__0 dna and rna are made up of monomers known as nucleotides
__label__1 the nucleotides combine with each other to form a polynucleotide  dna or rna
__label__0 if you examine  linkb  the diagram of a plant cell  you will see a structure external to the plasma membrane called the cell wall
__label__1 the cell wall is a rigid covering that protects the cell  provides structural support  and gives shape to the cell
__label__0 fungal and protistan cells also have cell walls
